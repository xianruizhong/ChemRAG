Fig. 19a shows that at 3.0 \u00b5m, electrons can be generated with sub-\u00c5 de Broglie wavelength and high kinetic energies spanning hundreds of eV. Fig. 20a shows that 100 eV electrons can achieve a momentum transfer of approximately between 2 -10 \u00c5 for sufficient for accurate structural retrieval. Generating such high kinetic energies is due to the $ scaling of the ponderomotive energy, \" , which arises from the larger distance and longer acceleration time of the free electron in the oscillating electric field of a longer (e.g. mid-infrared, MIR) wavelengths laser pulse. Standard femtosecond laser systems employ Ti:Sapphire technology which have a central wavelength in the near-infrared (NIR) regime of ~0.8 \u00b5m, leading to typical electron kinetic energies of tens of eV and a \u0394 \u2248 4 \u2212 5 \u00c5 )( . Thus, nearinfrared sources are therefore insufficient for LIED structural retrieval, requiring longer, MIR driver sources. Performing strong-field physics (SFP) measurements such as LIED in the MIR have additional benefits. Fig. 19c shows that at longer wavelengths (e.g. 3.0 \u00b5m), SFP measurements can be performed deeper into the quasistatic (tunnel ionization) regime (i.e. \u226a 1), leading to highly-energetic, classical electron trajectories and enabling the use of classical recollision models in describing SFP phenomena such as LIED. For example, the quantitative rescattering (QRS) model [7,221,222] can calculate and map electron trajectories to measured experimental features, which provides the propagation times and energy of the returning electrons at the instance of rescattering. This enables the study of changes in intensity of the electron signal at different kinetic energies arising from the molecular interference signal, Y , which is dependent on the molecular structure (i.e. Y depends on the internuclear distance of two-centre scatterings). The quasistatic regime (i.e. \u226a 1) can be reached by increasing the peak intensity of the laser field. However, this can lead to significant ionization and fragmentation of the molecular ion, depleting the number of ground-state neutral molecules readily available to perform LIED measurements",

In applying the theory to planar molecules, the corresponding boundary condition is C n point symmetry about an axis perpendicular to the plane [9]. In addition, it is necessary that the holes that are created in the HOMO band when the two electrons are excited are delocalized so as to rule out Frenkel exciton-like excitations where the hole and the excited electron are on the same or neighboring carbon sites. When these conditions are satisfied, there can be paired spin singlet states with energies on the order of several 10s of eV above the LUMO band and characteristic lengths on the scale of the C-C separation [6]. In [1,2] the authors point out that the energy of the 40 eV resonance is related to the distance between neighboring carbon atoms. To see the connection, we make the assumption that the Coulomb pair decays into a zero total momentum state with the two free electrons having the same kinetic energy. We express the energy in terms of the electron mass and the de Broglie wavelength, \u03bb DB . With a resonance energy of 40 eV, we find \u03bb DB = 2.6 \u00c5, a value that is approximately twice the C-C separation of 1.4 \u00c5. A similar argument can be made for the 10 eV resonance, with result that \u03bb DB in this case is 5.2 \u00c5. Expanding the localized state wave function, characterized by the length scale \u03bb LOC , in terms of the symmetrized two-electron plane-wave functions, it becomes evident that plane-wave states with \u03bb DB << \u03bb LOC do not make a significant contribution to the expansion. It follows that the maximum spatial extent of the pair is on the order of \u03bb DB . It should be noted that the introduction of the de Broglie wave presented here pertains to the 'free' electrons that result from the breakup of the bound pair. In contrast, in [1,2] the de Broglie wavelength is associated with the kinetic energy of the bound pair.\n\n\nAnalysis",

The correlation between the de Broglie wavelength related to the thermal motion and the potential barrier width and height is reported. The stochastic jumps of light atoms (hydrogen, deuterium) between two equilibrium sites A and B (identical geometry) occur via different pathways; one pathway is over the barrier (classical dynamics), and the other one is through the barrier (tunneling). On the over-the-barrier pathway, there are no obstacles for the de Broglie waves, and this pathway exists from high to low temperatures up to 0 K because the thermal energy is subjected to the Maxwell distribution and a certain number of particles owns enough energy for the hopping over the barrier. On the tunneling pathway, the particles pass through the barrier, or they are reflected from the barrier. Only particles with the energy lower than barrier heights are able to perform a tunneling hopping. The de Broglie waves related to these energies are longer than the barrier width. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is applied to calculate the rate constant of tunneling dynamics. The Maxwell distribution of the thermal energy has been taken into account to calculate the tunneling rate constant. The equations for the total spectral density of complex motion derived earlier by us together with the expression for the tunneling rate constant, derived in the present paper, are used in analysis of the temperature dependence of deuteron spin-lattice relaxation of the ammonium ion in the deuterated analogue of ammonium hexachloroplumbate ((ND4)2PbCl6). It has been established that the equation CpTtun = EH (thermal energy equals activation energy), where Cp is the molar heat capacity (temperature-dependent, known from literature), determines directly the low temperature Ttun at which the de Broglie wavelength, lambdadeBroglie, related to the thermal energy, CpT, is equal to the potential barrier width, L. Above Ttun, the lambdadeBroglie wavelength related to the CpT energy is shorter than the potential barrier width and not able to overcome the barrier. The activation energy EH equals 7.5 kJ/mol, and therefore, the Ttun temperature for deuterons in ((ND4)2PbCl6 is 55.7 K. The agreement between the potential barrier width following from the simple geometrical calculations (L = 0.722 A) and de Broglie wavelength at Ttun (L = 0.752 A) is good. The temperature plots of the deuteron correlation times for (ND4)2PbCl6 reveal comparable values of the correlation times of the tunneling, (tau(T)), and over-the-barrier jumps (tau(H)) near 34.8 K.

In our analysis, we made extensive use of the numerical and analytical results reported in [10,12]. All the aromatic hydrocarbon molecules that have been studied so far have high-energy resonances at \uf0bb 40 eV that we associate with carbon atoms on the perimeter of the molecule. Unique among the molecules studied, coronene and pyrene also have low energy resonances (\uf0bb10 eV) that we attribute to quasi-bound states of \uf070 electrons on carbon atoms inside the perimeter. The difference in the energies of the high and low energy resonances reflects the difference in the magnitude of the parameters U and Uint.\n\nThe high-energy resonances have energies much greater than the transfer integral. In this limit, the resonance peaks are centered at U.

At this energy or lower, the photoionization would likely probe a coherent delocalized state of water (or, using alternative language, reflect the interference between the photoelectrons ejected from the individual fragments). This is consistent with the recent measurements at low kinetic energies by Signorell and co-workers 21 that show a significant reduction in the \u03b2 of valence bands from large water clusters. Therefore, at low energies, the single-center expansion of the photoelectron wave function is justified. In contrast, at high energies (e.g., above 150 eV where the photoelectron wavelength is 1\u00c5), it is more appropriate to describe photoionization using localized orbitals. The observed persistent anisotropy of photoelectrons confirms that water's valence orbitals retain their identity, despite being slightly distorted (polarized and hybridized) by their environment. This implies that PES and photoelectron imaging can probe the local electronic structure of a molecule even in a solvent, as long as the ejected photoelectron has a de Broglie wavelength smaller than the proximity of nearby solvent molecules.",

We can understand this in the context of Sanov and co-worker's molecular interferometer, 38 where the short-time evolution of time-resolved photoelectron images from dissociating I \u2212 2 are discussed in terms of the interference between the two waves coming from the individual atoms.

In order to further explore activities of photo-generated electrons, gibberellic acid has been spotted on TiO 2 nanoparticles whose band gap is similar as that of zinc oxide but electron mobility is about 20 times lower. However, all other experimental conditions including laser wavelength and strength of electric field voltages were maintained the same as that described for zinc oxide. It was found in this experiment that less fragmentation can be observed when GA was spotted on surfaces of TiO 2 nanoparticles. As shown in Figure 2 (B), the molecular ion (M-1) at m/z 345 is the dominant peak and other fragment ions are relatively very much low abundance. Compared with ZnO, TiO 2 has much lower electron mobility and thus much lower tunneling probability 29 . It has been discovered in our previous work that decreased kinetic energy resulting from decreased electron mobility not only causes decreased tunneling probability but also decreased fragmentations. The result shown in Figure 2 (B) confirms this discovery once again. However, under this situation, fragmentation can still be achieved by increasing the bias voltage between the sample plate and the aperture because photogenerated electrons are accelerated 29 . But it should be mentioned that different fragmentation mechanisms maybe involved and different fragment ions maybe obtained. Supplementary Figure 5 demonstrates the roles of external electric field in kinetic energy, electron impact and intramolecular vibrational energy redistributionassociated molecular fragmentation. Fragment ions observed in this figure are different from that of Figure 2 (A). In Supplementary Figure 5 (A-E), potential differences between the sample plate and the aperture were changed from 20 volts to 100 volts respectively. At 40 eV high energy, the de Broglie wavelength of electrons is more than regular bond length of organic molecules. So these electrons may be strong enough to cause intra-molecular vibrational redistribution of energy. Additionally, because their energies are higher than typical ionization potential (7,15 eV), the impact of these hot electrons on organic molecules may be able to kick out lone-pair electrons and initiate extensively subsequent fragmentation. It is shown that the molecular ion at m/z 345 dramatically decreases but several other fragment ions can be observed when the potential difference increases to 40 volts. Further increases in potential differences result in even decreased intensity of the molecular ion at m/z 345 as summarized in Figure",

Nowadays, this wavelength is called the de Broglie wavelength. For example, the electrons in a CRT display have a De Broglie wavelength of about 10\u221213 m. To prevent the wave function for such a particle being spread over all space, de Broglie proposed using wave packets to represent particles that are localized in space.

Depth of penetration is related to the absorption and scattering of light, which is primarily a function of the wavelength of the excitation source. Light is absorbed by endogenous chromophores found in living tissue (e.g. hemoglobin, melanin, and lipids). In general, light absorption and scattering decreases with increasing wavelength. Below ~700 nm (e.g. visible wavelengths), these effects result in shallow penetration depths of only a few millimeters. Thus, in the visible region of the spectrum, only superficial assessment of tissue features is possible. Above 900 nm, water absorption can interfere with signal-to-background ratio. Because the absorption coefficient of tissue is considerably lower in the near infrared (NIR) region (700-900 nm), light can penetrate more deeply, to depths of several centimeters.",

The sequence does not converge as n tends to infinity, so neither does the infinite series.

Each of these terms is at least 1/n, and since there are n/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2.

In an infinitesimal time dt, the particle sweeps out an approximate right triangle whose area is Since the force acting on the particle is assumed to be a central force, the particle sweeps out equal angles in equal times, by Newton's Proposition 2.

At the apapsis and periapsis, the positions of closest and furthest distance from the attracting center, the velocity and radius vectors are perpendicular; therefore, the angular momentum L1 per mass m of the particle (written as h1) can be related to the rate of sweeping out areas",

However, later experiments showed that the muon did not participate in the strong nuclear interaction. In modern terminology, this makes the muon a lepton, and not a meson. However, some communities of astrophysicists continue to call the muon a \"mu-meson\".

Additional peaks with smaller amplitudes in the 330-650 nm range and broad spectrum white light is observed depending on the excitation conditions. The spatial and spectral distribution of the emitted light, with pink-orange regions identifying percolation paths in some cases and high intensity blue and white light with center to edge variations in others, indicate that multiple mechanisms lead to light emission. Under certain conditions, the tungsten probe tips used to make electrical contact with the ZnO structures melt during the excitation, indicating that the local temperature can exceed 3422 \u00b0C, which is the melting temperature of tungsten. The distinct and narrow peaks in the optical spectra and the abrupt increase in current at high electric fields suggest that a plasma is formed by application of the electrical bias, giving rise to light emission via atomic transitions in gaseous zinc and oxygen. The broad spectrum, white light emission is possibly due to the free electron transitions in the plasma and blackbody radiation from molten silicon. The white light may also arise from the recombination through multiple defect levels in ZnO or due to the optical excitation from solid ZnO. The electrical measurements performed at different ambient pressures result in light emission with distinguishable differences in the emission properties and I-V curves, which also indicate that the dielectric breakdown of ZnO, sublimation, and plasma formation processes are the underlying mechanisms.

Recently, RGD peptide (containing Arg-Gly-Asp motif)-based therapy of solid tumor cells has attracted much attention. However, little is known whether this method can target self-renewal capacity, key effectors of PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways such as metastasis-driver gene CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes with caspase-3 reactivation in CRCSCs overexpressing RGD-dependent integrins.

FraC altered cellular morphology to round shapes and disrupted cell connections. 48\u202fh post-treatment with 0.056- to 7.2\u202f\u03bcM FraC resulted in 12\u202f%-99\u202f% and 8\u202f%-97.6\u202f% decreases in cell numbers and viabilities respectively and increased LDH activity by 0.2\u202f%-66.7\u202f% in a dose-dependent manner. The results of the cytotoxicity index showed that FraC induces significant toxicity on HCT-116 cells compared to PBMCs and Huvec cells. FraC dramatically decreased the expression of CXCR4 and pluripotency network genes Bmi-1, Sox-2, Oct-4 and Nanog followed by remarkable decreases in self-renewal capacity ranged from 91- to 0 colonies per well for 0.056- to 3.6\u202f\u03bcM FraC after 2 weeks. Caspase-3 was found to contain an RGD-binding motif and its activity increased with increasing FraC concentrations followed by apoptosis induction. Potential RGD-binding motifs for FraC were also found in caspase-1, -7, -8 and -9. Unique advantages of FraC peptide, such as low molecular weight, water solubility, high sensitivity of CRC stem-like cells with more selective toxicity to this compound, targeting tumor cell membrane and self-renewal capacity along with the modulation of CXCR4 and stem cell regulatory genes as upstream and downstream effectors of undruggable PI3K and KRAS signaling pathways may open up avenues for FraC peptide-based therapy of PIK3CA/KRAS-mutant CRCSCs with lower toxicity on healthy cells.",

Under the same pressure resistance index, the outer diameter and the total length of the frac plug are small, the inner diameter is big, and the pressure resistance downhole passing performance are better.

(3) Using the structural modular design, the frac plug has outstanding advantages in terms of on-site installation, preventing early seat sealing, self-separation after release, less dissolvable matter, and so on. (4) The finite element simulation and physical simulation experiments show that 121.36 mm ID casing with the frac plug can tolerate deformation in the range of 15 mm, which meets the needs for the casing usage.

We previously demonstrated that membrane-associated Mmp2 is expressed in exit glia and contributes to motor axon targeting. To identify possible substrates, we undertook a yeast interaction screen for Mmp2-binding proteins and identified the novel ECM protein faulty attraction (Frac). Frac encodes a multidomain extracellular protein rich in epidermal growth factor (EGF) and calcium-binding EGF domains, related to the vertebrate Fibrillin and Fibulin gene families. It is expressed in mesodermal domains flanking Mmp2-positive glia. The juxtaposition of Mmp2 and Frac proteins raises the possibility that Frac is a proteolytic target of Mmp2. Consistent with this hypothesis, levels of full-length Frac are increased in Mmp2 loss-of-function (LOF) and decreased in Mmp2 gain-of-function (GOF) embryos, indicating that Frac cleavage is Mmp2 dependent. To test whether frac is necessary for axon targeting, we characterized guidance in frac LOF mutants. Motor axons in frac LOF embryos are loosely associated and project ectopically, a phenotype essentially equivalent to that of Mmp2 LOF. The phenotypic similarity between enzyme and substrate mutants argues that Mmp2 activates Frac. In addition, Mmp2 overexpression pathfinding phenotypes depend on frac activity, indicating that Mmp2 is genetically upstream of frac. Last, overexpression experiments suggest that Frac is unlikely to have intrinsic signaling activity, raising the possibility that an Mmp2-generated Frac fragment acts as a guidance cue cofactor. Indeed, we present genetic evidence that Frac regulates a non-canonical LIM kinase 1-dependent bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway in motoneurons necessary for axon pathfinding during embryogenesis.",

We tested the hypothesis that this increase is because the <iColletotrichum</i population has developed resistance to commonly used single-mode-of-action (single-MoA) fungicides. We screened 220 <iColletotrichum</i isolates obtained from 38 apple orchards in the Mid-Atlantic region for resistance to 11 fungicides in Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) groups 1, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 29. Eleven (5%) of these isolates were resistant to FRAC group 1 with confirmed \u03b2-tubulin E198A mutations, and two (&lt;1%) were also resistant to FRAC group 11 with confirmed cytochrome-<ib</i G143A mutations. Such low frequencies of resistant isolates indicate that fungicide resistance is unlikely to be the cause of any regional increase in bitter rot. A subsample of isolates was subsequently tested in\u00a0vitro for sensitivity to every single-MoA fungicide registered for apple in the Mid-Atlantic U.S.A. (22 fungicides; FRAC groups 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 29), and 13 fungicides were tested in field trials. These fungicides varied widely in efficacy both within and between FRAC groups. Comparisons of results from our in\u00a0vitro tests with results from our field trials and other field trials conducted across the eastern U.S.A. suggested that EC<sub25</sub values (concentrations that reduce growth by 25%) are better predictors of fungicide efficacy in normal field conditions than EC<sub50</sub values. We present these results as a guideline for choosing single-MoA fungicides for bitter rot control in the Mid-Atlantic U.S.A.",

Therefore, there is a need for a multiparametric approach to study sperm function. Recently, we developed a Fluorescence-Based Ratiometric Analysis of Sperm Centrioles (FRAC) assay to determine sperm centriole quality. Here, we perform a pilot study of sperm from 10 fertile men and 10 men in couples with unexplained infertility, using three centriolar biomarkers measured at three sperm locations from two sperm fractions, representing high and low sperm quality. We found that FRAC can identify men from couples with unexplained infertility as the likely source of infertility. Higher quality fractions from 10 fertile individuals were the reference population. All 180 studied FRAC values in the 10 fertile individuals fell within the reference population range. Eleven of the 180 studied FRAC values in the 10 infertile patients were outliers beyond the 95% confidence intervals (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). Three men with unexplained infertility had outlier FRAC values in their higher quality sperm fraction, while four had outlier FRAC values in their lower quality sperm fraction (3/10 and 4/10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.060 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.025, respectively), suggesting that these four individuals are infertile due, in part, to centriolar defects.

In the present study, we analyzed the efficacy of an ethyl acetate fraction from the tuber extract of Pueraria tuberosa (fraction rich in antioxidant compounds, FRAC) against menopausal osteoporosis, and breast and ovarian cancer cells. The FRAC from Pueraria tuberosa was characterized for its phenolic composition (total phenolic and flavonoid amount). Antioxidant property (in vitro assays) of the FRAC was also carried out followed by the analysis of the FRAC for its antiosteoporotic and anticancer potentials. The antiosteoporotic activity of FRAC was investigated in ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats. The cytotoxicity effect was determined in breast and ovarian cancer cells. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of the FRAC was performed to determine its various phytoconstituents. Docking analysis was performed to verify the interaction of bioactive molecules with estrogen receptors (ERs). The FRAC significantly improved various biomechanical and biochemical parameters in a dose-dependent manner in the ovariectomized rats. FRAC also controlled the increased body weight and decreased uterus weight following ovariectomy in rats. Histopathology of the femur demonstrated the restoration of typical bone structure and trabecular width in ovariectomized animals after treatment with FRAC and raloxifene. The FRAC also exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in the breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and ovarian (SKOV-3) cancer cells. Furthermore, genistein and daidzein exhibited a high affinity towards both estrogen receptors (\u03b1 and \u03b2) in the docking study revealing the probable mechanism of the antiosteoporotic activity. GC/MS analysis confirmed the presence of other bioactive molecules such as stigmasterol, \u03b2-sitosterol, and stigmasta-3,5-dien-7-one. The FRAC from Pueraria tuberosa has potential for treatment of menopausal osteoporosis. Also, the FRAC possesses anticancer activity.",

The influence of experimental parameters, such as pollutant concentration, contact time, and pH, on the adsorption properties of M-FRAC was studied in detail. The adsorption process was highly dependent on pH and initial contaminant concentration. All pollutant adsorption was favorable under acidic conditions. The optimal pH of the CR, TC, and Cr<sup6+</sup adsorption was 5, 4, and 2, respectively, while that of BPA was in the range of 2-5.

The adsorption processes of pollutants on M-FRAC were in accordance with the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption kinetics fitted the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetics model. In addition, M-FRAC could be readily separated from solution by applying an external magnetic field. Therefore, the M-FRAC has a good application prospect in practical industrial wastewater treatment.",

Shoots with cankers, pycnidia, and dieback were collected from six locations around the state. Isolates obtained from these samples were identified as Botryosphaeria obtusa, Phomopsis amygdali, Leucostoma persoonii, and Cytospora sp., based on colony morphology, conidia size and shape, and ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. L. persoonii was the most prevalent species and was isolated in five of the six locations, followed by P. amygdali and B. obtusa. The sensitivity of representative isolates of B. obtusa, P. amygdali, and L. persoonii to fungicides of different FRAC codes was evaluated. All species tested were sensitive to thiophanate-methyl (FRAC 1) and pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin (both FRAC 11), whereas all species were resistant to boscalid and fluopyram (both FRAC 7). P. amygdali and B. obtusa were sensitive to difenoconazole and propiconazole (both FRAC 3), whereas L. persoonii was moderately resistant. L. persoonii was the most virulent species based on expansion of mycelium in the cambium layer of 2-year-old, detached twig pieces. Bacterial spot (BS)-sensitive cultivar 'O'Henry' was most susceptible to B. obtusa compared with BS-sensitive 'Summerprince', brown rot (BR)-resistant 'Contender', and BR-sensitive 'Coronet' but was least susceptible to L. persoonii. Coronet was most susceptible to L. persoonii. There were no significant differences between susceptibility of the cultivars to P. amygdali. This study established that L. persoonii is currently the most frequent twig blight pathogen in South Carolina, perhaps owing to its superior fitness. Some fungicides were effective in controlling all twig blight pathogens and may therefore be useful for chemical management strategies. Our study also provides the first evidence that the genetic basis of resistance to BS and BR in peach trees is not necessarily linked to tolerance to wood pathogens.",

Preferential siting of new industrial facilities in poor areas or in areas with few regulatory restrictions can have implications for environmental sustainability, human health, and social justice. This study focuses on frac sand mining-the mining of high-quality silica sand used in hydraulic fracturing processes for gas and oil extraction. Frac sand mining gained prominence in the 2000s in the upper midwestern United States where nonmetallic mining is regulated primarily by local zoning. I asked whether frac sand mines were more commonly sited in rural townships without formal zoning regulations or planning processes than in those that undertook zoning and planning before the frac sand boom. I also asked if mine prevalence was correlated with socioeconomic differences across townships. After creating a probability surface to map areas most suitable for frac sand mine occurrence, I developed neutral landscape models from which to compare actual mine distributions in zoned and unzoned areas at three different spatial extents. Mines were significantly clustered in unzoned jurisdictions at the statewide level and in 7 of the 8 counties with at least three frac sand mines and some unzoned land. Subsequent regression analyses showed mine prevalence to be uncorrelated with land value, tax rate, or per capita income, but correlated with remoteness and zoning. The predicted mine count in unzoned townships was over two times higher than that in zoned townships. However, the county with the most mines by far was under a county zoning ordinance, perhaps indicating industry preferences for locations with clear, homogenous rules over patchwork regulation. Rural communities can use the case of frac sand mining as motivation to discuss and plan for sudden land-use predicaments, rather than wait to grapple with unfamiliar legal processes during a period of intense conflict.

Despite years of focused research knowledge of falls aetiology is poor. This may be partly due to classification approaches which conventionally report fall frequency. This nosology is blunt, and does not take into account causality or the circumstances in which the fall occurred. For example, it is likely that people who fall from a postural transition are phenotypically different to those who fall during high level activities. Recent evidence supports the use of a novel falls classification based on fall related activity, however its clinimetric properties have not yet been tested. This study describes further development of the Fall-Related Activity Classification (FRAC) and reports on its inter-rater reliability (IRR). Descriptors of the FRAC were refined through an iterative process with a multidisciplinary team. Three categories based on the activity preceding the fall were identified. PD fallers were categorised as: (1) advanced (2) combined or (3) transitional. Fifty-five fall scenarios were rated by 23 raters using a standardised process. Raters comprised 3 clinical subgroups: (1) physiotherapists, (2) physicians, (3) non-medical researchers. IRR analysis was performed using weighted kappa coefficients and included sub group analysis based on clinical speciality. Excellent agreement was reached for all clinicians, \u03ba=0.807 (95% CI 0.732 to 0.870). Clinical subgroups performed similarly well (range of \u03ba=0.780 to 0.822). The FRAC can be reliably used to classify falls. This may discriminate between phenotypically different fallers and subsequently strengthen falls predictors in future studies.",

Three technical processes should be differentiated when evaluating human health risks, namely (1) drilling of the borehole, (2) hydraulic stimulation, and (3) gas or oil production. During the drilling phase, emissions such as NO<subx</sub, NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds) as precursors for tropospheric ozone formation, and SO<subx</sub have been shown to be higher compared to the subsequent phases. In relation to hydraulic stimulation, the toxicity of frac fluids is of relevance. More than 1100 compounds have been identified as components. A trend is to use fewer, less hazardous and more biodegradable substances; however, the use of hydrocarbons, such as kerosene and diesel, is still allowed in the USA. Methane in drinking water is of low toxicological relevance but may indicate inadequate integrity of the gas well. There is a great concern regarding the contamination of ground- and surface water during the production phase. Water that flows to the surface from oil and gas wells, so-called 'produced water', represents a mixture of flow-back, the injected frac fluid returning to the surface, and the reservoir water present in natural oil and gas deposits. Among numerous hazardous compounds, produced water may contain bromide, arsenic, strontium, mercury, barium, radioactive isotopes and organic compounds, particularly benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX). The sewage outflow, even from specialized treatment plants, may still contain critical concentrations of barium, strontium and arsenic. Evidence suggests that the quality of groundwater and surface water may be compromised by disposal of produced water. Particularly critical is the use of produced water for watering of agricultural areas, where persistent compounds may accumulate. Air contamination can occur as a result of several HF-associated activities. In addition to BTEX, 20 HF-associated air contaminants are group 1A or 1B carcinogens according to the IARC. In the U.S., oil and gas production (including conventional production) represents the second largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions. High-quality epidemiological studies are required, especially in light of recent observations of an association between childhood leukemia and multiple myeloma in the neighborhood of oil and gas production sites. In conclusion, (1) strong evidence supports the conclusion that frac fluids can lead to local environmental contamination; (2) while changes in the chemical composition of soil, water and air are likely to occur, the increased levels are still often below threshold values for safety; (3) point source pollution due to poor maintenance of wells and pipelines can be monitored and remedied; (4) risk assessment should be based on both hazard and exposure evaluation; (5) while the concentrations of frac fluid chemicals are low, some are known carcinogens; therefore, thorough, well-designed studies are needed to assess the risk to human health with high certainty; (6) HF can represent a health risk via long-lasting contamination of soil and water, when strict safety measures are not rigorously applied.",

Tank mixes of demethylation-inhibiting (DMI; Fungicide Resistance Action Committee [FRAC] group 3) or quinone outside inhibitor (QoI; FRAC group 11) fungicides with chlorothalonil (FRAC group M5) at full or reduced rates were evaluated for effectiveness against A. anomala. The use of chlorothalonil in a mix with a DMI or QoI fungicide was an effective treatment for EFB even if each component of the mix was at half the labeled rate. Different liquid or dry formulations of chlorothalonil were equally effective in a tank mix for EFB control. The combination of propiconazole (FRAC group 3) tank mixed with trifloxystrobin (FRAC group 11) was not effective, whereas trees treated with propiconazole tank mixed with pyraclostrobin (FRAC group 11) resulted in significantly fewer EFB cankers compared with nontreated trees. When using tank mixes for EFB management, DMI fungicides should remain at full rates while mixing with a half-rate of chlorothalonil. In contrast, QoI fungicides and chlorothalonil could both be used at half-rates and still maintain acceptable EFB control. Tank mixing chlorothalonil with fungicides at risk of resistance development can help maintain consistent EFB control and should help prevent or delay the emergence of fungicide-resistant A. anomala isolates.",

Availability of original observations enabled individual participant data meta-analysis. Differences in control of powdery mildew on leaves and cones were apparent among fungicide FRAC groups when individual products were evaluated over the course of a growing season. FRAC groups 13, 3, and U13 provided the most efficacious control of powdery mildew on leaves. Percent disease control on cones was influenced by midseason foliar disease and fungicide mode-of-action. FRAC 13 provided significantly better disease control on cones than all other groups except U13, 3, and premixes of 7 with 11. Disease control on leaves was similar when a rotational program of fungicides was used, independent of the modes of action, but improved on cones if FRAC groups 13 and 3 were both included compared with programs consisting of FRAC groups 11 and 3, 11 and 5, or 3 and 5. Disease control on cones was improved from 32 to 52%, on average, when the fungicide quinoxyfen (FRAC 13) was applied at least once during the early stages of cone development, defined in this analysis as 20 July to 10 August, as compared with all other treatments. Efficacy of disease control on cones by quinoxyfen was moderated by and interacted with the incidence of leaves with powdery mildew. Disease control on cones was further improved if two applications of quinoxyfen were made during this period. Collectively, these findings suggest that disease control during juvenile stages of cone development largely influences the success of fungicide programs and point to the critical importance of focusing management efforts during this stage of development, independent of what actual management strategy is employed.",

Fungicide resistance is a widespread problem that has reduced the efficacy of fungicides. Resistance to FRAC-1 (Fungicide Resistance Action Committee-1) chemistries is associated with mutations in amino acid position 198 in the \u03b2-tubulin gene. In our study, we conducted a meta-analysis of \u03b2-tubulin sequences to infer temporal, spatial, plant host, and pathogen genus patterns of fungicide resistance in postharvest fungal pathogens. In total, data were acquired from 2,647 specimens from 12 genera of fungal phytopathogens residing in 53 countries on &gt;200 hosts collected between 1926 and 2020. The specimens containing a position 198 mutation were globally distributed in a variety of pathosystems. Analyses showed that there are associations among the mutation and the year an isolate was collected, the pathogen genus, the pathogen host, and the collection region. Interestingly, fungicide-resistant \u03b2-tubulin genotypes have been in a decline since their peak between 2005 and 2009. FRAC-1 fungicide usage data followed a similar pattern in that applications have been in a decline since their peak between 1997 and 2003. The data show that, with the reduction of selection pressure, FRAC-1 fungicide resistance in fungal populations will decline within 5 to 10 years. Based on this line of evidence, we contend that a \u03b2-tubulin position 198 mutation has uncharacterized fitness cost(s) on fungi in nature. The compiled dataset can inform end users on the regions and hosts that are most prone to contain resistant pathogens and assist decisions concerning fungicide resistance management strategies.",

Good solutions to this task have applications in fraud and intrusion detection. The unsupervised anomaly detection task is different: Given unlabeled, mostly-normal data, identify the anomalies among them. Many real-world machine learning tasks, including many fraud and intrusion detection tasks, are unsupervised because it is impractical (or impossible) to verify all of the training data. We recently presented FRaC, a new approach for semi-supervised anomaly detection. FRaC is based on using normal instances to build an ensemble of feature models, and then identifying instances that disagree with those models as anomalous.

The fraC operon transcript partially overlaps gene all2395, which lies in the opposite DNA strand and ends 1 bp beyond fraE. Gene all2395 produces transcripts of 1.35 kb (major transcript) and 2.2 kb (minor transcript) that overlap fraE and whose expression is dependent on the N-control transcription factor NtcA. Insertion of a gene cassette containing transcriptional terminators between fraE and all2395 prevented production of the antisense RNAs and resulted in an increased length of the cyanobacterial filaments. Deletion of all2395 resulted in a larger increase of filament length and in impaired growth, mainly under N2-fixing conditions and specifically on solid medium.

However, it is becoming more evident that there are multiple layers of post-transcriptional gene regulation that greatly impact protein output (Battle et al., Science 347:664-667, 2014; Khan et al., Science 342:1100-1104, 2013; Vogel et al., Mol Syst Biol 6:400, 2010). Alternative splicing (AS) impacts the expression of protein coding genes in several ways. Firstly, AS increases exponentially the coding-capacity of genes generating multiple transcripts from the same genomic sequence. Secondly, alternatively spliced mRNAs are subjected differentially to RNA-degradation via pathways such as nonsense mediated decay (AS-NMD) or microRNAs (Shyu et al., EMBO J 27:471-481, 2008). And thirdly, cytoplasmic export from the nucleus and translation are regulated in an isoform-specific manner, adding an extra layer of regulation that impacts the protein output of the cell (Martin and Ephrussi, Cell 136:719-730, 2009; Sterne-Weiler et al., Genome Res 23:1615-1623, 2013). These data highlight the need of a method that allows analyzing both the nuclear events (AS) and the cytoplasmic fate (polyribosome-binding) of individual mRNA isoforms.In order to determine how alternative splicing determines the polyribosome association of mRNA isoforms we developed Frac-seq. Frac-seq combines subcellular fractionation and high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Frac-seq gives a window onto the translational fate of specific alternatively spliced isoforms on a genome-wide scale. There is evidence of preferential translation of specific mRNA isoforms (Coldwell and Morley, Mol Cell Biol 26:8448-8460, 2006; Sanford et al., Genes Dev 18:755-768; Zhong et al., Mol Cell 35:1-10, 2009; Michlewski et al., Mol Cell 30:179-189, 2008); the advantage of Frac-seq is that it allows analyzing the binding of alternatively spliced isoforms to polyribosomes and comparing their relative abundance to the cytosolic fraction. Polyribosomes are resolved by sucrose gradient centrifugation of cytoplasmic extracts, subsequent reading and extraction. The total mRNA fraction is taken prior ultracentrifugation as a measure of all mRNAs present in the sample. Both populations of RNAs are then isolated using phenol-chloroform precipitation; polyadenylated RNAs are selected and converted into libraries and sequenced. Bioinformatics analysis is then performed to measure alternatively spliced isoforms; several tools can be used such as MISO, RSEM, or Cufflinks (Katz et al., Nat Methods 7:1009-1015, 2010; Li and Dewey, BMC Bioinformatics 12:323, 2011; Trapnell et al., Nat Protoc 7:562-578, 2012). Comparison of total mRNAs and polyribosome-bound mRNAs can be used as a measure of the polyribosome association of specific isoforms based on the presence/absence of specific alternative splicing events in each fraction.

Here, we present a series of new experiments and a modification to this equation to model the dissolution of a two-component oil-mixture microdroplet into a second immiscible solvent in which the two materials of the droplet have different solubilities. The model is based on a reduced surface area approximation and the assumption of ideal homogeneous mixing [mass flux d(m(i))/dt = A(frac(i))D(i)(c(i) - c(s)){(1/R) + (1/(\u03c0D(i)t)(1/2)}] where A(frac(i)) is the area fraction of component i, c(i) and c(s) are the initial and saturation concentrations of the droplet material in the surrounding medium, R is the radius of the droplet, t is time, and D(i) is the coefficient of diffusion of component i in the surrounding medium. This new model has been tested by the use of a two-chamber micropipet-based method, which measured the dissolution of single individual microdroplets of mutually miscible liquid mixtures (ethyl acetate/butyl acetate and butyl acetate/amyl acetate) in water. We additionally measured the diffusion coefficient of the pure materials-ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and amyl acetate-in water at 22 \u00b0C.

This model accurately predicts the dissolution of microdroplets for the ethyl acetate/butyl acetate and butyl acetate/amyl acetate systems given the solubility and diffusion coefficients of each of the individual components in water as well as the initial droplet radius. The average mean squared error was 8.96%. The dissolution of a spherical ideally mixed multicomponent droplet closely follows the modified Epstein-Plesset model presented here.",

We conducted a multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled, clinical trial in subjects with a history of colonic neoplasia who manifested altered SPEC/FRAC in histologically normal colonic mucosa. Subjects (n=79) were randomised to 325\u2005mg aspirin or placebo. The primary endpoint changed in FRAC and SPEC spectral markers after 3\u2005months. Mucosal levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A6 genotypes were planned secondary endpoints. At 3\u2005months, the aspirin group manifested alterations in SPEC (48.9%, p=0.055) and FRAC (55.4%, p=0.200) with the direction towards non-neoplastic status. As a measure of aspirin's pharmacological efficacy, we assessed changes in rectal PGE2 levels and noted that it correlated with SPEC and FRAC alterations (R=-0.55, p=0.01 and R=0.57, p=0.009, respectively) whereas there was no significant correlation in placebo specimens. While UGT1A6 subgroup analysis did not achieve statistical significance, the changes in SPEC and FRAC to a less neoplastic direction occurred only in the variant consonant with epidemiological evidence of chemoprevention.

In order to deal with the long de Broglie wavelength of cold molecules, the total wave function is divided into interaction, asymptotic and long-range regions (IALR). The three regions use different numbers of ro-vibrational basis functions, especially the long-range region, which uses only one function corresponding to the initial ro-vibrational state. Thus, a very large grid range can be used to characterize long de Broglie wavelengths in scattering coordinates.

The correlation between the de Broglie wavelength related to the thermal motion and the potential barrier width and height is reported. The stochastic jumps of light atoms (hydrogen, deuterium) between two equilibrium sites A and B (identical geometry) occur via different pathways; one pathway is over the barrier (classical dynamics), and the other one is through the barrier (tunneling). On the over-the-barrier pathway, there are no obstacles for the de Broglie waves, and this pathway exists from high to low temperatures up to 0 K because the thermal energy is subjected to the Maxwell distribution and a certain number of particles owns enough energy for the hopping over the barrier. On the tunneling pathway, the particles pass through the barrier, or they are reflected from the barrier. Only particles with the energy lower than barrier heights are able to perform a tunneling hopping. The de Broglie waves related to these energies are longer than the barrier width. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is applied to calculate the rate constant of tunneling dynamics. The Maxwell distribution of the thermal energy has been taken into account to calculate the tunneling rate constant. The equations for the total spectral density of complex motion derived earlier by us together with the expression for the tunneling rate constant, derived in the present paper, are used in analysis of the temperature dependence of deuteron spin-lattice relaxation of the ammonium ion in the deuterated analogue of ammonium hexachloroplumbate ((ND4)2PbCl6). It has been established that the equation CpTtun = EH (thermal energy equals activation energy), where Cp is the molar heat capacity (temperature-dependent, known from literature), determines directly the low temperature Ttun at which the de Broglie wavelength, lambdadeBroglie, related to the thermal energy, CpT, is equal to the potential barrier width, L. Above Ttun, the lambdadeBroglie wavelength related to the CpT energy is shorter than the potential barrier width and not able to overcome the barrier. The activation energy EH equals 7.5 kJ/mol, and therefore, the Ttun temperature for deuterons in ((ND4)2PbCl6 is 55.7 K. The agreement between the potential barrier width following from the simple geometrical calculations (L = 0.722 A) and de Broglie wavelength at Ttun (L = 0.752 A) is good. The temperature plots of the deuteron correlation times for (ND4)2PbCl6 reveal comparable values of the correlation times of the tunneling, (tau(T)), and over-the-barrier jumps (tau(H)) near 34.8 K.

The spin pairs of the protons or deuterons of the methyl group perform a complex motion consisting of three component motions. Two of them involve mass transportation over the barrier and through the barrier. They are characterized by k((H)) (Arrhenius) and k((T)) (Schr\u00f6dinger) rate constants, respectively. The third motion causes fluctuations of the frequencies (nomega(I)+/-omega(T)) and it is related to the lifetime of the methyl spin at the energy level influenced by the rotor-bath interactions. These interactions induce rapid transitions, changing the symmetry of the torsional sublevels either from A to E or from E(a) to E(b). The correlation function for this third motion (k((omega)) rate constant) has been proposed by M\u00fcller-Warmuth et al. The spectral densities of the methyl group hindered rotation (k((H)), k((T)) and k((omega)) rate constants) differ from the spectral densities of the proton transfer (k((H)) and k((T)) rate constants) because three compound motions contribute to the complex motion of the methyl group. The recently derived equation [Formula: see text] , where [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] are the fraction and energy of particles with energies from zero to E(H), is taken into account in the calculations of the spectral densities. This equation follows from Maxwell's distribution of thermal energy. The spectral densities derived are applied to analyse the experimental temperature dependencies of proton and deuteron spin-lattice relaxation rate in solids containing the methyl group. A wide range of temperatures from zero Kelvin up to the melting point is considered. It has been established that the motion characterized by k((omega)) influences the spin-lattice relaxation up to the temperature T(tun) only. This temperature is directly determined by the equation C(p)T=E(H) (thermal energy=activation energy), where C(p) is the molar heat capacity. Probably the cessation of the third motion is a result of the de Broglie wavelength related to this motion becoming too short. As shown recently, the potential barrier can be an obstacle for the de Broglie wave. The theoretical equations derived in this paper are compared to those known in the literature.",

We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect on Na/Ca exchange of interventions affecting Ca2+ flux through SR. Experiments were performed in single, isolated myocytes of guinea-pig and rat hearts loaded with Indo 1-AM and free Ca2+ concentration was assessed by measuring the ratio of fluorescence at 405 and 495 nm wavelength. In guinea-pig 1.0 microM ryanodine (Ry), expected to increase Ca2+ flux through the SR, decreased the amplitude of electrically stimulated Ca2+ transients by 35% and inhibited their initial, rapid phase. Responses of these cells to brief superfusions with 15 mM caffeine were inhibited which suggests that 1.0 microM Ry depleted the SR Ca2+ stores. Diastolic Ca2+ concentration was slightly increased, but it dropped below control during prolonged rest. Decrease of the amplitude of the transients in these ryanodine-treated cells were reversed by 2 x 10(-7) M thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the SR Ca(2+)-ATPase, by 1.0 mM Ry, a blocker of the SR Ca2+ release channels and by low Na+ (50.0 mM) superfusion. This suggests that the decreased transients in 1.0 microM Ry result from uptake of Ca2+ by the SR and its rapid release to the subsarcolemmal (cleft) space where a fraction is diverted out of the cell via Na/Ca exchange before it can diffuse to the myofilaments. Removal of the SR from the pathway (addition of TG on 1.0 mM Ry) or reversal of Na/Ca exchange diverts more transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx to the myofilaments and increases the Ca2+ transient. Decrease of the resting Ca2+ concentration was blocked by 2 x 10(-7) M TG, 1.0 mM Ry, and by 5.0 mM Ni2+, a blocker of Na/Ca exchange. This result suggests that the effect of 1.0 microM Ry on resting Ca2+ concentration also resulted from increase of flux of Ca2+ through the SR and out of the cell by Na/Ca exchange. In rat 1.0 microM Ry decreased amplitude of the transients by approximately 75% but did not affect their kinetics. TG and 1.0 mM Ry decreased the rate of rise of the transients and greatly delayed their decay. This result suggests that normal kinetics of the transients in the cells treated with 1.0 microM Ry depended on the preserved Ca2+ flux through the SR. As SR was not able to retain Ca2+ in these cells, decay of the transients must have depended on stimulated Na/Ca exchange. The results in guinea-pig and rat taken together are compatible with the proposal that Ca2+ released from the SR interacts with the cell's Na/Ca exchanger most probably within the newly defined subsarcolemmal \"Na/Ca exchange-dependent Ca2+ compartment\".",

Due to the extremely long de Broglie wavelength in such processes, quantum reactive scattering is most conveniently characterized using the time-independent close-coupling (TICC) methods. However, the TICC approach is difficult for systems with a large number of channels because of its steep numerical scaling laws. Here, a recently proposed quantum wave packet (WP) approach for solving adiabatic reactive scattering problems at low collision energies is extended to include nonadiabatic transitions. To impose the outgoing boundary conditions, the total scattering wavefunction is split into three parts, the interaction, the asymptotic, and the long-range regions. Each region is associated with a different set of basis functions, which could be optimized separately. In this way, an extremely long grid can be used to accommodate the characteristic long de Broglie wavelengths in the scattering coordinate. The better numerical scaling laws of the WP approach have the potential for handling larger nonadiabatic reactive systems at low temperatures in the future.",

In the imaginary time path integral formalism, each atom is mapped onto a \"ring polymer\" whose spread is related to the quantum mechanical uncertainty in the particle's position, i.e., its thermal wavelength. A number of metrics have previously been used to investigate and characterize this spread and explain effects arising from quantum delocalization, zero-point energy, and tunneling. Many of these shape metrics consider just the instantaneous structure of the ring polymers. However, given the significant interest in methods such as centroid molecular dynamics and ring polymer molecular dynamics that link the molecular dynamics of these ring polymers to real time properties, there exists significant opportunity to exploit metrics that also allow for the study of the fluctuations of the atom delocalization in time. Here we consider the ring polymer delocalization from the perspective of computational topology, specifically persistent homology, which describes the 3-dimensional arrangement of point cloud data, (i.e. atomic positions). We employ the Betti sequence probability distribution to define the ensemble of shapes adopted by the ring polymer. The Wasserstein distances of Betti sequences adjacent in time are used to characterize fluctuations in shape, where the Fourier transform and associated principal components provides added information differentiating atoms with different NQEs based on their dynamic properties.

Here, we discuss the determination of h/m(X) for the neutron n, the 133 Cs atom, and the 87 Rb atom. The results, including the inferred values of \u03b1, are summarized in Table 26.\n\n\nQuotient h/mn\n\nThe PTB determination of h/m n was carried out at the ILL high-flux reactor. The de Broglie relation p = m n v = h/\u03bb was used to determine h/m n = \u03bbv for the neutron by measuring both its de Broglie wavelength \u03bb and corresponding velocity v. More specifically, the de Broglie wavelength, \u03bb \u2248 0.25 nm, of slow neutrons was determined using back reflection from a silicon crystal, and the velocity, v \u2248 1600 m/s, of the neutrons was determined by a special time-of-flight method. The final result of the experiment is (Kr\u00fcger et al., 1999) h m n d 220 (W04) = 2060.267 004(84) m s \u22121\n[4.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ] ,(322)\nwhere as before, d 220 (W04) \nh m n d 220 (W04) = A r (e) A r (n) c\u03b1 2 2R \u221e d 220 (W04)\n.",

Indeed, Figure 2 reveals such a scaling of the a 2 0 (j ) and a 2 2+ (j ) moments for the He-NO (j = \u2126 = 1/2 \u2192 j = 9/2, \u2126 = 1/2) channel and a range of collision energies. The scaling was implemented by the transformation \u03d1 \u2192 \u03d1R 0 /\u03bb, where \u03d1 is the scattering angle, R 0 is the molecular size and \u03bb is the de Broglie wavelength. Whereas the alignment moments furnished by the Fraunhofer model coincide exactly upon scaling in \u03d1 (black solid line), such a scaling brings the exact moments (filled circles, squares, and triangles) quite close to one another, but does not result in their exact matching. The remaining differences among the scaled exact moments corresponding to different collision energies attest to non-diffractive contributions to scattering, the influence of the attractive branch of the PES, and a breakdown of the sudden approximation. For instance, the scaled exact moments corresponding to 520 and 1000 cm \u22121 come close to one another, while the oscillations for 150 cm \u22121 are quite off, especially for the a 2 0 (j ) moment. We ascribe this discrepancy to the potential well of 25 cm \u22121 [13] that brings about non-diffractive contributions ing channels. Interestingly, at low collision energies (10 cm \u22121 ), the oscillations of the alignment moments fall further out of phase, but the form factors still remain in place.",

For this purpose, it is easy to show that particle movements, insertions and deletions, and box changes must be done as in typical N V T , \u00b5V T and N P zz T sampling [33]. In particular, after trying a change of particles' positions, we perform several attempts of inserting-deleting water and ethane molecules. This is done by randomly calling the four possible trials in such a way that all calls are equally probable. This is important in order to guaranty the establishment of detail balance. Since accepting insertions or deletions are rare, we repeat this step 10 times or until accepting any insertion or deletion. In case of refusing the 10 insertion-deletion trials, we performed a box trial move. In this way, the system rapidly evolves to an equilibrium state that, in general, depends on the initial conditions. \n\n\nIII. RESULTS",

For purposes of establishing the reaction, ignore the final stages and concentrate on the initial 10-20% of the reaction at first. A globally optimized model may be based on a faulty assumption for the initial steps. Thus, although the whole data set may look reasonably well fit, the reaction could be misrepresented, and thus the fit unhelpful if accuracy at the later stages has come at the expense of the initial phase of the reaction. 2. What is the time course of the initial reaction? (A) Is the reaction exponential? Exponential growth gives dramatic lag times (see Fig. 3), whereas nonexponential \"lag times\" have a visible signal from time 0 (i.e., Fig. 2). If the data set shows the abrupt appearance of signals after a period of quiescence, the chances are excellent that the time course is exponential. High sensitivity measurement of the signal at times during the lag phase should be used to confirm the exponential nature quantitatively. Exponential reactions mean a secondary pathway is operative. (a) A cascade (tn) can look similar to an exponential, but may proceed from a multistep single-path reaction. Thus the exponential needs to be ascertained with some accuracy. (b) It is possible that some or all of the lag results from a stochastic process, i.e., formation of a single nucleus being observed. This, however, is likely to be accompanied by a secondary process, as few techniques are sensitive enough to detect a single polymer at a time, and having one nucleus form many polymers is a hallmark of a secondary process. Thus, the reproducibility of the kinetics must be established to rule out stochastics. If data show wide variation, stochastic methods as described earlier may be employed. (c) Given a secondary process, one must separate the primary nucleation process from the secondary process (by stochastic means or by use of the product B2A, as described earlier). (B) If the reaction does not begin with an exponential, is it parabolic? If so, it falls in the general class of linear polymerizations. 3. What is the concentration dependence of the reaction(s)? This will separate nucleation processes from growth, and so on. 4. If the initial reaction is neither exponential nor parabolic, a reaction mechanism needs to be proposed and evaluated. Solving the resulting equations is best done by linearization, which has the best chance of giving equations whose solutions and their sensitivity to parameters are readily understood. If this proves fruitful, full numeric solutions may be useful. 5. At this point, the full reaction may be considered to completion. 6. The physical basis of the description (sizes of parameters and their dependencies) needs to be finally considered to ensure that the mathematical success of the description rests on tenable physical grounds.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

Second, the respiratory motion signal is estimated from the k-space center of the contrast varying acquisition using an adapted singular spectrum analysis (SSA-FARY) technique. Third, a motion-resolved model-based reconstruction is used to estimate both parameter and coil sensitivity maps directly from the sorted k-space data. Thus, spatiotemporal total variation, in addition to the spatial sparsity constraints, can be directly applied to the parameter maps. Validations are performed on an experimental phantom, 11 human subjects, and a young landrace pig with myocardial infarction.

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles. As the FEV(1) quartile worsened (mean, 62%, 49%, 39%, and 27% predicted), functional residual capacity increased (144%, 151%, 164%, and 185% predicted), IC decreased (86%, 81%, 69%, and 60% predicted), and peak incremental cycle work rate decreased (66%, 55%, 50%, and 44% predicted); CWR endurance time was 9.7, 9.3, 8.2, and 7.3 min, respectively.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The complexity of the circuit and the dependency of the voltage reference on power supply variations are simultaneously decreased through the use of a new compensation circuit technique. The proposed BGR is simulated using a 0.35 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ CMOS standard process. Consequently, a 5.53 ppm/\u00b0C temperature coefficient is obtained in the -40~+125 \u00b0C temperature range, the maximum power supply rejection ratio is - 62 dB, and a 2.033 mV/V voltage line regulation is achieved for the $2.3\\sim 4.3$ V supply voltage.

The interface includes an LED as excitation light source, a custom designed CMOS biosensor, a multimode fiber, a microcontroller (MCU), and a wireless data transceiver enclosed within a 3D-printed, small and light weight, plastic housing. Precisely, the system incorporates a new optoelectronic biosensor merging two individual building blocks, namely a low-noise sensing front-end and $\\mathrm {a}2 ^{nd}$ order continuous-time $\\Sigma \\Delta $ modulator (CTSDM), into a single module for enabling high-sensitivity and high energy-efficiency photo-sensing.

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |\u03a6 x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data. We multiply KD single-particle \u03b2 2 = 0 differential cross sections by the respective SF of the model with the core excitation and compare with the KD(\u03b2 2 = 0.5) results fully including the core excitation.

We start with the excited state 1 2 + analysis in Fig. 4 where we expect some similarities with the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) case [12][13][14]. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

The transmitter employs simultaneous tuning and locking, to set the desired channel with a minimal injected power. The VCO is designed and fabricated in a 0.13 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ SiGe BiCMOS process and has a core area of 0.5 $\\mathrm{m}\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission. Therefore, this VCO presents a key building block of an injection locked, frequency agile, implantable transmitter for the MICS band.",

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV.

Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories.

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model.

In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling \u03b2 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

Since it takes nearly as much energy to excite the hydrogen atom's electron from n = 1 to n = 3 (12.1 eV, via the Rydberg formula) as it does to ionize the hydrogen atom (13.6 eV), ionization is far more probable than excitation to the n = 3 level.

In the case of neutral atomic hydrogen, the minimum ionization energy is equal to the Lyman limit, where the photon has enough energy to completely ionize the atom, resulting in a free proton and a free electron.

Q1251+3644 is a faint QSO (V=19), and over 10 hours of observing time yields a spectrum with modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 10) at high-resolution. The SNR drops quickly at lower wavelengths, and we cannot extract useful information from the highest order Lyman lines as a result. The system towards Q1759+7539 is a complex system of absorbers with a very high neutral hydrogen column density, log N(H I) > 10 19 (all column densities expressed in cm \u22122 ). The analysis of that system gives only an upper limit on D/H, at the 95% confidence level; the constraints are obtained from comparing the line profiles of Ly\u03b2 and Ly\u03b3 to the profile of Ly\u03b1 . The method used to extract the limits on D/H will be described below. These results are preliminary, and improved constraints will require more data to allow a robust analysis. Tytler et al. (1996) made the first measurement of low D/H in the absorption system at z = 3.572 towards Q1937-1009. We analyzed the highresolution spectrum (8 hrs of exposure), which resolved the entire Lyman series up to Ly-19, as well as associated metal lines.

However, some important molecules exhibit a spectrum of narrow lines even at wavelengths as short as 100 nm.

Since 2002, the proton and deuteron charge radii have been independently refined parameters in the CODATA set of recommended values for physical constants, that is both scattering data and spectroscopic data are used to determine the recommended values. The 2014 CODATA recommended values are: proton: Rp = 0.8751(61)\u00d710\u221215 m deuteron: Rd = 2.1413(25)\u00d710\u221215 m",

These are highly energetic atomic nuclei with >MeV energies. Cosmic rays penetrate much deeper into clouds than UV radiation and ionize a small fraction of atomic and molecular hydrogen needed to kick-start the gas-phase chemistry.\n\nCosmic rays also maintain a low level of UV radiation deep inside dense clouds 19 : the ionization of H and H 2 produces energetic secondary electrons which excite H 2 into the B 1 \u03a3 + u and C 1 \u03a0 u electronic states, which subsequently decay through spontaneous emission in the Lyman and Werner bands. The resulting UV spectrum consists of discrete lines and a weak continuum in the 900-1700 A range 20 . The flux of internally generated UV photons is typically 10 4 photons cm \u22122 s \u22121 but depends on the energy distribution of the cosmic rays (see Fig. 4 of Shen et al. 21 ) and the grain properties.\n\nInterstellar clouds are largely neutral, since hydrogen-ionizing photons have been absorbed in the more diffuse surrounding gas. Of the major elements, only carbon can be ionized by the ISRF because its first ionization potential is less than 13.6 eV. Since the abundance of gas-phase carbon with respect to hydrogen is about 10 \u22124 (see Table 1), this sets the maximum electron fraction in the cloud to about 10 \u22124 . With depth into the cloud, the ionized carbon is converted into neutral atomic and molecular form. Around A V =5 mag, cosmic rays take over as the main ionizing agent at a rate denoted by \u03b6 in s \u22121 . The resulting ionization fraction depends on the detailed chemistry and grain physics but is typically 10 \u22127 or lower, and scales as (n/\u03b6) \u22121/2 .\n\n\nThe tools: telescopes, laboratory\n\n\nImportance of multi-wavelength observations\n\nThe energy levels of a molecule are quantized into electronic, vibration and rotation states, with decreasing energy difference between two neighboring levels of the same type.

This study sought to determine the theoretical basis and clinical evidence for the effectiveness of helium-neon lasers in treating vitiligo. Cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts were irradiated with 0.5-1.5 J per cm2 helium-neon laser radiation. The effects of the helium-neon laser on melanocyte growth and proliferation were investigated. The results of this in vitro study revealed a significant increase in basic fibroblast growth factor release from both keratinocytes and fibroblasts and a significant increase in nerve growth factor release from keratinocytes. Medium from helium-neon laser irradiated keratinocytes stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake and proliferation of cultured melanocytes. Furthermore, melanocyte migration was enhanced either directly by helium-neon laser irradiation or indirectly by the medium derived from helium-neon laser treated keratinocytes. Thirty patients with segmental-type vitiligo on the head and/or neck were enrolled in this study. Helium-neon laser light was administered locally at 3.0 J per cm2 with point stimulation once or twice weekly. The percentage of repigmented area was used for clinical evaluation of effectiveness. After an average of 16 treatment sessions, initial repigmentation was noticed. Marked repigmentation (&gt;50%) was observed in 60% of patients with successive treatments. Basic fibroblast growth factor is a putative melanocyte growth factor, whereas nerve growth factor is a paracrine factor for melanocyte survival in the skin. Both nerve growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor stimulate melanocyte migration. It is reasonable to propose that helium-neon laser irradiation clearly stimulates melanocyte migration and proliferation and mitogen release for melanocyte growth and may also rescue damaged melanocytes, therefore providing a microenvironment for inducing repigmentation in vitiligo.",

To simulate He-Ne laser scanner exposures, 40-microseconds pulses of 647-nm light transmitted through a revolving disk with holes in the periphery were used to expose the retinas of monkeys under deep anesthesia at pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) of 100, 200, 400, and 1,600 Hz for exposure durations of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 s.

The threshold for 488-nm pulses was consistently lower than that for 647-nm pulses at all PRFs and exposure times. The difference in thresholds increased with exposure time and PRF. The sharp decreases in 488-nm thresholds at 100-s exposure times for each PRF can be interpreted as a basically photochemical effect. The radiant exposure required for damage at 647 nm was several orders of magnitude above the radiant exposure from typical He-Ne scanner applications.

The rate of wound closure was followed by photographing the wounds in a standardized way. The collagen hydroxyproline concentration in the scar tissue was determined on the 18th postoperative day. Helium-neon laser radiation had a statistically significant stimulating effect on collagen synthesis in the wound, with a maximum effect at an energy density of 4 joules/sq cm. The rate of wound closure was enhanced significantly between the third and 12th postoperative days. The argon laser exposure produced a significant increase in collagen concentration both in irradiated and nonirradiated contralateral wounds. However, an acceleration of the healing rate was not registered in this case. The wound contraction up to the fourth day of the experiment was inhibited under helium-neon and argon laser exposure to 20 joules/sq cm. The described effects were not specific for the laser light.

Most previous studies focused on the harmful UV effects, and the biologic effects of lights at other spectrums remained unclear. Recently, lights at visible region have been used for regenerative purposes. Using the process of vitiligo repigmentation as a research model, we focused on elucidating the pro-differentiation effects induced by visible light. We first showed that helium-neon (He-Ne) laser (632.8 nm) irradiation stimulated differentiation of primitive pigment cells, an effect not replicable by UVB treatment even at high and damaging doses. In addition, significant increases of mitochondrial DNA copy number and the regulatory genes for mitochondrial biogenesis were induced by He-Ne laser irradiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that He-Ne laser initiated mitochondrial retrograde signaling via a Ca(2+)-dependent cascade. The impact on cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria is responsible for the efficacy of He-Ne laser in promoting melanoblast differentiation. Taken together, we propose that visible lights from the sun provide important environmental cues for the relatively quiescent stem or primitive cells to differentiate. In addition, our results also indicate that visible light may be used for regenerative medical purposes involving stem cells.",

Healing rates were evaluated clinically and photographically. Sixty-nine percent of the irradiated incisions healed faster than the control incisions. No significant difference in healing was noted when patients were compared by age, gender, race, and anatomic location of the incision. This study concludes that helium-neon diode lasers, at the previously mentioned energy level, increase the rate of gingival wound healing in 69 percent of patients, without any side effects. For the last 30 years, low-power lasers in dentistry have appeared to stimulate healing rates and increase the rate of repair of injured tissue. Helium-neon and similar lasers emit light in the red (600-700 nm) spectrums and produce energy densities (fluences) below 20 Joules/cm2. They have been studied in a variety of animal tissue culture and human evaluations to determine their ability to increase the rates of wound healing by biostimulation. Over the last three decades, researchers have found that ruby and gas helium-neon (low-power laser radiation) have a biostimulatory effect on living tissue. Studies show that under specific conditions, red spectrum laser light speeds the healing of wounds. Photons from the red light lasers, which include ruby lasers (694 nm), helium-neon gas lasers (632 nm), and helium-neon diode lasers (650-670 nm), appear to stimulate rapid epithelialization and fibroblast (collagen) proliferation in animal and human tissue cultures. Low-power lasers have been reported to reduce post-extraction pain and swelling and to increase rates of wound healing (including scar formation, phagocytosis) in cell culture, animal, and human clinical studies. The new, compact, and inexpensive (under $50) helium-neon diode lasers have produced similar effects. These FDA Class IIIa lasers have no hazards associated with them, although one should avoid direct exposure to the eye for a prolonged period of time. In the past, many biostimulation studies using red spectrum lasers produced confusing data and conflicting results. Some studies reported that the biostimulation effect did not occur in all cases of laser irradiation, while other research reported that it did. Results seem to depend on the delivery of appropriate energy fluence levels (between 1 and 20 J/cm2) and the type of laser (wavelength) used. Several of these studies never described the levels of laser energy used to promote the described biostimulatory results. This caused controversy when determining whether or not helium-neon lasers influence wound healing. Studies suggest that low-power laser exposure can significantly increase the healing rate during the first few days of the healing process; however, studies do not show appreciable net benefit as compared to controls toward the end of a two-week wound repair cycle. The increased healing effect appears to be centered around the early, most sensitive stages of the healing process. Several studies showed optimum tissue healing rates at helium-neon laser exposure levels between 1 J/cm2 and 20 J/cm2. Laser-enhanced biostimulation has been reported to produce metabolic changes within the cells. This results in faster cell division, rapid matrix production (increased collagen, myofibroblasts, etc.), and cell movement. There have been few controlled studies using adequate numbers of human subjects in identifying the beneficial effects of helium-neon laser biostimulation. Ethical concerns, bulky equipment, and problems with biased study designs have frustrated a practical evaluation of laser biostimulation for general dental practice. A recently published \"preliminary\" study involving 52 patients was designed to reduce these issues. The purpose of this study is to complement the above research and to evaluate whether helium-neon diode laser radiation at average fluences of 0.34 J/c",

Recent studies have implicated the role of amyloid \u03b2-peptides (A\u03b2) in mediating these processes. In astrocytes, oligomeric A\u03b2 induces the assembly of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complexes resulting in its activation to produce anionic superoxide. A\u03b2 also promotes production of pro-inflammatory factors in astrocytes. Since low energy laser has previously been reported to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation in biological systems, the objective of this study was to examine whether this type of laser light was able to abrogate the oxidative and inflammatory responses induced by A\u03b2. Primary rat astrocytes were exposed to Helium-Neon laser (\u03bb=632.8 nm), followed by the treatment with oligomeric A\u03b2. Primary rat astrocytes were used to measure A\u03b2-induced production of superoxide anions using fluorescence microscopy of dihydroethidium (DHE), assembly of NADPH oxidase subunits by the colocalization between the cytosolic p47(phox) subunit and the membrane gp91(phox) subunit using fluorescent confocal microscopy, phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) cPLA(2) and expressions of pro-inflammatory factors including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) using Western blot Analysis.

Irradiation of solutions containing either purified cytochromes or dissolved rat liver mitochondria was carried out (wavelength 632.8 nm, fluence rate 10 mW cm(-2), fluence 2 J cm(-2)); the irradiation conditions were the ones able to affect cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity in mitochondria (Pastore et al., 1994). Cytochrome c oxidation catalysed by COX was affected by He-Ne laser irradiation of the purified enzyme. This result was obtained from measurements of the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant and from determinations of the turnover number of the enzyme, performed at different cytochrome c/COX ratios. Consistently, the kinetic parameters of COX changed. On the contrary, no alteration in the rate of electron transfer catalysed by either cytochrome c or bc1 complex was found. This study shows that purified COX is a specific target of He-Ne laser light; therefore, COX may be considered to be a mitochondrial photo-acceptor.",

This study aimed to establish if the dose, wavelength or duration of effect (1h or 24h) influences the biological responses of irradiated fibroblasts. The study established cellular responses of normal and wounded human skin fibroblasts to helium-neon (632.8 nm), diode (830 nm) and Nd:YAG (1064 nm) laser irradiation using one exposure of 5 J/cm(2) or 16 J/cm(2) on day 1 and again on day 4.

Wounded cells exposed to 5 J/cm(2) using 632.8 nm showed an increase in ATP viability after 1h, a decrease in caspase 3/7 activity after 24h and an increase in cell proliferation after 24h. The results suggest that changes in parameters such as ATP viability should be observed directly after laser irradiation (1h) whereas other parameters such as caspase 3/7 activity, bFGF expression and ALP enzyme activity should be measured at least 24h after the final exposure. This study confirms that the duration of effect should be included as one of the main laser parameters when reporting on the effects of laser irradiation. It is important to establish time-dependent responses as the results may provide an understanding of the cellular responses following laser irradiation.",

We have previously shown that the helium-neon laser (He-Ne laser, 632.8 nm) is a therapeutic option for treatment of this depigmentary disorder. Addressing the intricate interactions between melanocytes, the most important cellular component in the repigmentation scheme of vitiligo, and their innate extracellular matrix collagen type IV, the current study aimed to elucidate the effects of the He-Ne laser on melanocytes. Cultured melanocytes were irradiated with the He-Ne laser. Relevant biological parameters including cell attachment, locomotion and growth were evaluated. In addition, the potentially involved molecular pathways were also determined. Our results show that in addition to suppressing mobility but increasing attachment to type IV collagen, the He-Ne laser stimulates melanocyte proliferation through enhanced alpha2beta1 integrin expression. The expression of phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB), an important regulator of melanocyte growth, was also upregulated by He-Ne laser treatment. Using a specific mitochondrial uncoupling agent [carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP)], the proliferative effect of the He-Ne laser on melanocytes was abolished and suppression of melanocyte growth was noted. In summary, we have demonstrated that the He-Ne laser imparts a growth stimulatory effect on functional melanocytes via mitochondria-related pathways and proposed that other minor pathways including DNA damage may also be inflicted by laser treatment on irradiated cells. More importantly, we have completed the repigmentation scheme of vitiligo brought about by He-Ne laser light in vitro and provided a solid theoretical basis regarding how the He-Ne laser induces recovery of vitiligo in vivo.",

Our previous studies demonstrated that He-Ne irradiation induced an increase in cell proliferation, but not migration, in the melanoma cell line A2058 cell. The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved in photostimulatory effects induced by an He-Ne laser. Using the A2058 cell as a model for cell proliferation, the photobiologic effects induced by an He-Ne laser were studied. He-Ne irradiation immediately induced an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi(mt)), ATP, and cAMP via enhanced cytochrome c oxidase activity and promoted phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/activator protein-1 (AP-1) expressions. He-Ne irradiation-induced A2058 cell proliferation was significantly abrogated by the addition of delta psi(mt) and JNK inhibitors. Moreover, treatment with an He-Ne laser resulted in delayed effects on IL-8 and transforming growth factor-beta1 release from A2058 cells.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

If one assumes that the same \u03b8 current occurs in the \u03c6 intersection, the charge is the same in either kind of intersection with the plane. The change in the orientation of the intersection from \u03b8 to \u03c6 like, accompanied with the 50:50 stochastic process is reveling in regard with the uncertainty principle. The \u03b8 orientation is what produces the sinusoidal electric field pattern printed in the plane and it is the way to know the momentum of the particle with precision. However, to do so the particle is in two places of the plane at the same time, therefore, the measurement of its exact position is even nonsensical. It is pure non-local to produce the wave that leaves in the plane. The stochastic change to the \u03c6 intersection stops the particle being non-local, to occupy just one place in flatland, thus its position can be measured very precisely but in doing so, it stops also to produce the sinusoidal pattern, ergo its momentum is completely unknown and there is no way to avoid this, because it is a particle-space intrinsic property. Fig. 12 and 13 show, clearly, that simple symmetry will explain zero and 100 \u2022 / \u2022 correlation experiments, respectively.

Therefore, the act of measuring the position of the up-going particle, affects the original entanglement and the precision in the measurement of the system total momentum; making it impossible to deduce, with precision, the momentum of the up-going particle by subtracting the momentum of the down-going particle from the system total momentum.

Therefore, the position dispersion \u03c3r cannot be simultaneously eliminated with the current dispersion \u03c3j in a single type of experiment, e.g., The information given us by carrying out the given experiment consists of removing the uncertainty existing before the experiment [32]. If we carry out the particle-localization probe we obtain some information, since its outcome means that we then know exactly, which position has actually been detected. This implies that, after repeated trials performed for the specified quantum state, the initial uncertainty contained in the position probability scheme has been completely eliminated. The average information gained by such tests thus amounts to the removed position uncertainty. The larger the uncertainty in p(r), the larger the amount of information obtained when we eventually find out which electron position has actually been detected after the experiment. In other words, the amount of information given us by the realization of the classical, probability scheme alone equals the global entropy in the classical probability scheme of Figure 1 [31,32].",

Guest Editor: Anthony NichollsStatisticsAUCVirtual screening enrichmentCorrelation coefficientsLinear regressionError barsConfidence intervals Introduction: Error bars\nComputational chemistry is a largely empirical field that makes predictions with substantial uncertainty. And yet the use of standard statistical methods to quantify this uncertainty is often absent from published reports. This article covers the basics of confidence interval estimation for molecular modeling using classical statistics. Alternate approaches such as non-parametric statistics and bootstrapping are discussed.\n\nWhen we report a number what do we mean by it? Clearly our intention is to convey information: after an experiment we think a property has a certain value; after this calculation our prediction of quantity X is Y. In reality, we know whatever number we report is only an estimate. For instance, we repeat an experiment to measure a partition coefficient between water and octanol five times and get an average, or we apply a computer model to a set of ten test systems and calculate a mean performance. In the former case, will a sixth measurement produce a similar number? In the latter case, do we know if the program will perform as well over a new test set? In other words, how do we know if these numbers are useful?",

This is different from what usual wisdom would suggest for a two-dimensional system (1/r decay) [60,80], and has also been described in Refs. [81,82].\n\nAs briefly outlined above in section Graphene FT-STS fundamentals, the underlying physics of this result stems from the chirality of the graphene quasiparticles [83,84]. The graphene quasiparticles, due to the presence of two atomic sublattices, have an additional degree of freedom deemed pseudospin, such that one says that a quasiparticle belonging to sublattice A has pseudospin \"up\", and a quasiparticle belonging to the sublattice B has pseudospin \"down\". By chirality, the pseudospin vector is parallel to the quasiparticle momentum, so that if we know the momentum of a quasiparticle, we automatically know its pseudospin, thus to which sublattice it belongs and in which proportion. Due to the chiral properties of the quasiparticles, backscattering of quasiparticles by extended impurities is forbidden [85,86], because when a quasiparticle is backscattered flipping its momentum by 180 o , by chirality, its pseudospin also flips. Since an extended impurity cannot flip the pseudospin of an electron (the wavelengths associated with backscattering are much larger than the atomic lattice constant), the backscattering cannot take place. Nevertheless, if the impurity is localized, the backscattering is not forbidden [87]. However, the incident and backscattered particle have opposite pseudopspins, and thus their wavefunctions cannot interfere constructively, same as the wavefunctions of two electrons with spin up and spin down cannot give rise to constructive interferences. This lack of interference yields a reduction of the Friedel oscillations in the vicinity of the impurity, which no longer decay as 1/r as in a regular two-dimensional electron gas, but much faster, as 1/r 2 .",

Quantum theory dictates that uncertainties on the position and energy-momentum four-vectors of radiation quanta obey Heisenberg's uncertainty relation; however, these uncertainties are neglected in \"classical\" MC simulations of radiation transport in which position and momentum are known precisely. Using the quantum uncertainty relation and electron mean free path, the magnitudes of uncertainties on electron position and momentum are calculated for different kinetic energies; a validity bound on the classical simulation of electron transport is derived. In order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, uncertainties of 5% must be assigned to position and momentum for 1 keV electrons in water; at 100 eV, these uncertainties are 17 to 20% and are even larger at lower energies. In gaseous media such as air, these uncertainties are much smaller (less than 1% for electrons with energy 20 eV or greater). The classical Monte Carlo transport treatment is questionable for sub-1 keV electrons in condensed water as uncertainties on position and momentum must be large (relative to electron momentum and mean free path) to satisfy the quantum uncertainty principle. Simulations which do not account for these uncertainties are not faithful representations of the physical processes, calling into question the results of MC track structure codes simulating sub-1 keV electron transport. Further, the large difference in the scale at which quantum effects are important in gaseous and condensed media suggests that track structure measurements in gases are not necessarily representative of track structure in condensed materials on a micrometer or a nanometer scale.",

Starting around 1927, Paul Dirac began the process of unifying quantum mechanics with special relativity by proposing the Dirac equation for the electron. The Dirac equation achieves the relativistic description of the wavefunction of an electron that Schr\u00f6dinger failed to obtain. It predicts electron spin and led Dirac to predict the existence of the positron.

Selenium and polonium are suspected as not in this scheme, while astatine's status is uncertain.

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10\u00a0keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000\u00a0nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions.

The effect of silicon substitution on the unimolecular dissociation processes and the threshold photoelectron spectrum has been investigated. Both molecular ions dissociate at low internal energies. For ionized MTBE, the parent ion is no longer observed at an internal energy of only 0.2 eV.

The more stable Jahn Teller distorted B2g conformation of the radical anion has been used in this study. Two different theories have been applied in this first part. The harmonic approximation in the classical Marcus scheme has been modified by using projected force constants, which are obtained from the complete force constant matrix and the geometry changes of the molecule during the ET (introduced by Mikkelsen). A different approach (introduced by Nelsen) combines the different energies of the neutral and radical anion with and without relaxation corresponding to the vertical ionization potential and the vertical electron affinity. The electronic energies of the neutral molecule and the radical anion differ dramatically applying three different levels of quantum mechanical calculations (UAM1, UB3LYP, PMP2 with three different basis sets with and without diffuse functions). Nevertheless the Nelsen method gives almost consistent results for the inner-sphere reorganization energies: 120.1 kJ/mol for semiempirical UAM1 method, 159.3 kJ/mol, 156.4 kJ/mol and 158.3 kJ/mol for density functional UB3LYP/6-31G*, UB3LYP/6-31++G* and UB3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ calculations and 192.5 kJ/mol for ab-initio PMP2/6-31G* investigations, respectively. These values are in agreement with earlier experimental work supposing the total reorganization energy to be larger than 38 kcal/mol assuming an electron self-exchange rate of 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). The simple harmonic approximation of Marcus relation has not yet been applied for a molecule like cyclooctatetraene with large torsional geometry changes. Using the projected force constants after scaling, considerably different results for the inner-sphere reorganization energy have been calculated: 738.1 kJ/mol for the UB3LYP/6-31G*, 743.3 kJ/mol for UB3LYP/6-31++G* and 759.1 kJ/mol for UB3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Comparison with our concentration dependent EPR experiments are controversial to the earlier experimental results, but the latter supports the assumption that the electron self-exchange occurs in a time scale so that the molecules cannot complete their vibrational motions. Therefore the projected Marcus relation is not valid for cyclooctatetraene/cyclooctatetraene radical anion including a large torsional change during the electron transfer.",

In electronic transitions, this process usually involves emission of light near the visible range. The amount of energy released is related to bond-dissociation energy or ionization energy and is usually in the range of a few to few tens of eV per bond. However, a much stronger type of binding energy, the nuclear binding energy, is involved in nuclear processes. Due to this, most nuclear excited states decay by gamma ray emission. For example, a well-known nuclear isomer used in various medical procedures is , which decays with a half-life of about 6 hours by emitting a gamma ray of 140 keV of energy; this is close to the energy of medical diagnostic X-rays.",

For many years, the values of EFG produced by external electrodes in the laboratory were too small to yield a measurable effect when interacting with a charge distribution of nuclear dimensions. As an alternative, the EFG produced by electrons in atomic or molecular environments, or by other charged particles (such as muons or kaons in bound orbits), or produced during the bombardment of a target nucleus with energetic ions were used. This section presents a brief outline of these experimental methods.\n\n\nAtomic or molecular environments\n\nIn a solid, electric field gradients of up to a few 10 18 V/cm 2 can be obtained from atomic or molecular charges. The hyperfine interaction between this kind of EFG and the quadrupole moment of an excited nuclear state can be measured from: (i) the magnitude of the hyperfine splitting in atomic transitions (energy differences), (ii) the M\u00f6ssbauer effect (in case of lowenergy gamma transitions E \u03b3 \u2264 130 keV); (iii) the attenuation of the angular distribution of deexcitation gamma rays.\n\n\nM\u00f6ssbauer effect\n\nWhen a nucleus is in a solid, fixed within a lattice, there is considerable probability that it can absorb and emit \u03b3-rays without energy loss going into the recoiling nucleus (M\u00f6ssbauer effect [17], [2]). The recoil energy and Doppler broadening of the \u03b3-ray are characterized by the mass and random velocity of the whole crystal and are therefore completely negligible. This high precision resonant absorption effect can be used to investigate very small changes in the nuclear energy levels that result from the hyperfine interactions between the nucleus and its electronic environment.\n\nThe probability of such a recoilless event depends on the energy of the gamma-ray, the temperature and vibrational properties of the solid. In general, the M\u00f6ssbauer effect is optimized for low-energy gamma-rays and low temperature lattices.\n\nThe finite energy spread of the M\u00f6ssbauer gamma ray can be related to the lifetime of the nuclear excited state. Whereas the interaction of the nuclear quadrupole moment with the EFG gives rise to a splitting of the nuclear energy levels that correspond to different alignments of the quadrupole moment with respect to the principal axis of the EFG.",

The difference in the excitation and emission wavelengths is called the Stokes shift, and the time that an excited electron takes to emit the photon is called a lifetime. The quantum yield is an indicator of the efficiency of the dye (it is the ratio of emitted photons per absorbed photon), and the extinction coefficient is the amount of light that can be absorbed by a fluorophore. Both the quantum yield and extinction coefficient are specific for each fluorophore and multiplied together calculates the brightness of the fluorescent molecule. Labelling Reactive dyes",

(This upper limit corresponds to the electron coming to a stop by emitting just one X-ray photon. Usually the electron emits many photons, and each has an energy less than 60 keV.)

The H loss channel is studied using DC slice ion imaging with two-color reduced-Doppler detection at 243 nm and 212 nm. The photochemistry is further studied deep in the vacuum UV, that is, at Lyman-alpha (121.6 nm). Translational energy distributions for the H + C(4)H product arising from dissociation of C(4)H(2) after excitation at 243, 212, and 121.6 nm show an isotropic angular distribution and characteristic translational energy profile suggesting statistical dissociation from the ground state or possibly from a low-lying triplet state. From these distributions, a two-photon dissociation process is inferred at 243 nm and 212 nm, whereas at 121.6 nm, a one-photon dissociation process prevails. The results are interpreted with the aid of ab initio calculations on the reaction pathways and statistical calculations of the dissociation rates and product branching. In a second series of experiments, nanosecond time-resolved phototionization measurements yield a direct determination of the lifetime of metastable triplet diacetylene under collisionless conditions, as well as its dependence on excitation energy. The observed submicrosecond lifetimes suggest that reactions of metastable diacetylene are likely to be less important in Titan's atmosphere than previously believed.",

However, triplet excited-state lifetimes of Os(II) complexes are often too short (\u03c4 &lt; 1 \u03bcs) to transfer their energy to neighboring molecules. While the covalent conjugation of chromophores has been known to extend the net excited-state lifetimes through an intramolecular triplet energy transfer (IMET), heavy-atom effects of the central metals on the attached chromophore units have rarely been discussed. Here, we investigate the relationship between the spin-density contribution of the heavy metals and the net triplet excited-state lifetimes for a series of Os(II) and Ru(II) bis(terpyridine) complexes modified with perylene units. Phosphorescence lifetimes of these compounds strongly depend on the lifetimes of the perylenyl group-localized excited states that are shortened by the heavy-atom effect. The degree of heavy-atom effect can be largely circumvented by introducing <imeta</i-phenylene bridges, where the perylene unit retains its intrinsic long excited-state lifetime. The thermal activation to the short-lived excited states is suppressed, thanks to sufficient but still small energy losses during the IMET process. Involvement of the metal center was also confirmed by the prolonged lifetime by replacing Os(II) with Ru(II) that possesses a smaller spin-orbit coupling constant.

A \u03b2-carotene molecule, intrinsic component of PSII, when absorbs a photon, gets excited and its energy level goes from the ground-state S 0 directly to S 2 (see the energy level diagram in Fig. 1). Recent studies revealed, that the surprising lack of S 0 to S 1 transition is not due to \u03b2-carotene symmetry properties as was thought for a long time, but rather it must have another physical origin, such as deformation of the molecule in the low-lying S 1 state [8]. The excited S 2 state can very quickly decay to the state S 1 (internal conversion) or to S 0 (via FRET or heat dissipation); this decay lasts 100-300 fs, on average [9]. From the state S 1 , the molecule undergoes the transition to S 0 in about 9 ps [10], also via FRET or heat dissipation. Hence, the whole process of releasing energy lasts no longer than 9.3 ps on average, but it may vary, as the excited state lifetimes are given by exponential distributions. Thereby, both the S 1 and S 2 states function as energy donors, however the transfer from the S 1 state was shown to be less favored [1]. On the other hand, a chlorophyll-a molecule, after absorbing energy from sunlight or via FRET from a \u03b2carotene, contributes to the initial reactions of photosynthesis. An excited chlorophyll-a starts this reaction by releasing an electron and returning to the ground-state in about 10 ps [11]. Comparing with synthetic fluorescent dyes like AlexaFluor, DyLight or GFP, where excited state lifetimes are measured in nanoseconds, it is clear that photosynthetic molecules are at least 2 orders of magnitude faster in emitting their energy. It has strong implications on the possible data throughput and will be touched upon in Section 5. What is very important, a chlorophyll-a, after getting a FRET signal from a \u03b2-carotene releases exactly one electron. This electron usually activates next steps of photosynthesis, but we can implicate that it could be caught by other devices as well. Thus, molecules of chlorophyll-a can be thought of as FRET-to-electron converters.",

Information about the lifetime \u03c4 k of each vibration mode k is needed. For solids, calculation of the lifetime has been established on the basis of perturbation theory. 53 For liquids, the effect of lifetime is so large that the perturbatic treatment is inappropriate. Direct application of the fluctuation-dissipation relation can provide a calculation method for susceptibility without knowing {\u03c4 k }. 54 But, in the present implementation, it is unclear how the contribution of the structural energy is coped in the formula.\n\nThe above difficulties can be solved, at one stroke, by adiabatic MD simulations based on the total-energy approach. We do not need to know lifetimes {\u03c4 k } but only their consequences on the equilibrium states are sufficient for calculating specific heat. The maximumentropy principle guarantees that entropy S is uniquely determined by a given U when equilibrium is established under given constraints, from which T is uniquely determined by T = \u2202U/\u2202S. The total energy E tot is conserved in adiabatic MD simulation. Accordingly, an infinite number of energy-dissipation processes finally lead the system to the unique state of equilibrium with T eq , which may be different from the initial temperature. All the effects of energy dissipation processes are included in the relation between the total internal energy U and the final temperature T eq in equilibrium, whatever energy dissipation processes are complicated. In this regards, use of adiabatic MD simulations is essential. When the temperature is controlled by introducing a heat bath, such as Nos\u00e9-Hoover thermostat, energy dissipations to the artificial heat bath destroy the intrinsic relationship between U and T , which is a property of a given material. In this respect, the present method is easy, because neither T nor V is needed to control.\n\n\nB.

While our simulations of excited-state absorption spectra do not indicate any clear absorption features for the S 1 (n S \u03c0*) of thioC, the minor transient absorption band at 345 nm might originate from partial population of another T 1 ( 3 \u03c0\u03c0 CS * ) minimum with the C\ue0c8S bond elongated and tilted out of the plane of the aromatic ring (S-oop in Figure 3c). Therefore, in contrast to the nucleoside, thioC base exhibits typical equilibrium between the ring-puckered and S out-of-plane (S-oop) T 1 minima, which was also reported for thionated uracil bases. 21 To evaluate the excited-state lifetimes of the nucleobase and nucleoside in a more accurate manner, we performed global fitting of excited-state decays in our time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy experiments within the entire range of our visible probe pulse (330\u2212600 nm). This fitting procedure returned global excited-state lifetimes of 7.1 \u00b1 1.4 ns for thioC and 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 ns for \u03b2-thioCyd, thus confirming the observations for specific wavelengths discussed above. Most importantly, thioC exhibits a nearly 5 times longer excitedstate lifetime than its nucleoside, thioCyd. It is noteworthy that the opposite trend was observed in time-resolved studies of canonical RNA building blocks, for which pyrimidine ribonucleosides exhibited several times longer excited-state lifetimes than their respective nucleobases. 50 Here, we assign this surprising trend to the dominant population of longerlived 3 \u03c0\u03c0 ring * state in thioC.

Thus, as we can see from Table III, even with a large number of acceptor molecules, it was not possible to obtain FRET efficiency higher than 50%. Also the respective bit error rates (30-50%) are highly non satisfactory for telecommunication purposes. A solution for this (other than exciting the donor multiple times per bit, what however decreases the corresponding data throughput [25]) might lie in exploiting full MIMO communication, i.e. to excite all the donor dyes simultaneously. It might be realized with a very strong external laser impulse or using the energy of a local chemical reaction, in this latter case it is called Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer. The receiver decodes the bit as '1' if any of acceptors is excited, i.e. if at least one donor transfers its excitation energy to at least one acceptor. If no acceptors are excited, the bit is decoded as '0'. For the proper data transmission, it is crucial to correctly choose the rate (frequency) of sending bits. Obviously, from the telecommunication point of view the higher rate the better, but the FRET and fluorescence delays are going to put the limits here. As documented in Table II and Fig. 4, with average fluorescence lifetimes of about 1-2 ns, almost all excited molecules will go back to the ground state after 15-20 ns. Since we do not know the exact FRET rate between fluorophores in our experiments, we have to assume that the energy transfer can occur in any time between a few to about 20 ns, i.e. as long as we observe photons after a single laser pulse. Additionally, we should take into account the relaxation time of the acceptor molecule. When the acceptor is excited, it cannot receive another signal from the donor 3 . Thus, the acceptor should first pass the signal via another FRET to other molecules or emit a photon. It adds another 20 ns to the total delay of the signal transfer. Consequently, in this case the transmission rate should not exceed 1 bit per 40 ns, i.e. 25 Mbit/s.

Some questions, however, remain about the nature of the receiver triplet states, which have been in principle assigned to specific triplets of a different electronic configuration from T(1). In particular, it could be suggested that even a small degree of n-\u03c0* character of the T(1) state may be enough to allow the S(1) state to couple to upper vibronic states of the lowest energy triplet, without the requirement for specific upper triplet states. In this report, we show that there are, in fact, nitroaromatic compounds that do not show the ultrafast intersystem crossing channel but instead have S(1) states that are two to three orders of magnitude longer lived. Our studies focused on the time resolution of the emission from singly nitrated pyrenes, which show a strong photophysical dependence on the position of the NO(2) group: Whereas S(1) in 1-nitropyrene is short-lived (up to 3 ps), in 4-nitropyrene and 2-nitropyrene this state has 0.41 and 1.2 ns lifetimes, respectively, in acetonitrile solution. Computational work at the TD-DFT level of theory indicates that such remarkable increase in the first excited singlet lifetime can indeed be explained by a loss of the energy coincidence between the S(1) state with specific upper triplet states formed from transitions that involve the nonbonding orbitals at the oxygen atoms. These results are in strong support of the previous descriptions about the requirement for intermediacy of specific triplet states in the ultrafast decay of the fluorescent state present in most nitroaromatics.

[42,43] The first singlet excited state (S 1 ) of these dyes decays mainly through a non-radiative channel involving a torsional motion of the phenyl rings. The S 1 lifetime depends strongly on the viscosity of the environment. For instance, the S 1 lifetime of MG amounts to 550 fs in bulk water and to 1.1 ps at the air-water interface. [42] This shows that the friction exerted by interfacial water is substantially larger than that experienced in bulk water. Similar experiments have also been performed at alkane-(water-glycerol) interfaces. [43,44] Information on other interfacial properties can be obtained by performing TRSSHG measurements with appropriate probe molecules. For example, the excitedstate lifetime of Eosin B has been found to strongly depend on its ability to form hydrogen bonds with surrounding solvent molecules. [45] We have used this property to probe hydrogen bonding at liquid-liquid interfaces. [46] Measurements at liquid-liquid interfaces can also be used to obtain mechanistic information on the deactivation pathway of an excited molecule. This has been done with an hemicyanine, whose S 1 state decays non-radiatively through large amplitude motion (Fig. 4). In order to find out which coordinate is responsible for this decay, the viscosity dependence of the S 1 state lifetime of this dye at liquid-liquid interfaces has been studied. Whereas the lifetime is independent of the viscosity of the polar phase, a substantial viscosity dependence of the nonpolar phase has been measured, indicating the involvement of a mode localised in the apolar part of the molecule. [47] We have recently started to investigate the dynamics of photoinduced ET at liquid-liquid interfaces. Preliminary measurements point to substantial differences between bulk and interfacial dynamics. However, further experiments and new instrumental developments are needed before more definitive conclusions can be drawn.\n\n\nConclusion and Outlook",

Transient absorption at visible probe wavelengths was used to directly observe relaxation of the lowest excited singlet state (S(1) state) populated by a UV pump pulse. In H(2)O, transient absorption signals from adenine decay biexponentially with lifetimes of 0.18 +/- 0.03 ps and 8.8 +/- 1.2 ps. In contrast, signals from monomethylated adenines decay monoexponentially. The S(1) lifetimes of 1-, 3-, and 9-methyladenine are similar to one another and are all below 300 fs, while 7-methyladenine has a significantly longer lifetime (tau = 4.23 +/- 0.13 ps). On this basis, the biexponential signal of adenine is assigned to an equilibrium mixture of the 7H- and 9H-amino tautomers. Excited-state absorption (ESA) by 9-methyladenine is 50% stronger than by 7-methyladenine. Assuming that ESA by the corresponding tautomers of adenine is unchanged, we estimate the population of 7H-adenine in H(2)O at room temperature to be 22 +/- 4% (estimated standard deviation). To understand how the environment affects nonradiative decay, we performed the first solvent-dependent study of nucleobase dynamics on the ultrafast time scale. In acetonitrile, both lowest energy tautomers of adenine are present in roughly similar proportions as in water. The lifetimes of the 9-substituted adenines depend somewhat more sensitively on the solvent than those of the 7-substituted adenines. Transient signals for adenine in H(2)O and D(2)O are identical. These solvent effects strongly suggest that excited-state tautomerization is not an important nonradiative decay pathway. Instead, the data are most consistent with electronic energy relaxation due to state crossings between the optically prepared (1)pipi* state and one or more (1)npi* states and the electronic ground state. The pattern of lifetimes measured for the monomethylated adenines suggests a special role for the (1)npi* state associated with the N7 electron lone pair.",

In particular, the effects of the macrocyclic \u03c0-electron system, central metal ion (CMI), peripheral substituents, and pigment aggregation, on these critical parameters are discussed. The results obtained confirm that the \u03c0-electron system of the chromophore has the greatest influence on the light energy conversion capacity of porphyrinoids. Its modifications lead to changes in molecular symmetry, which determine the energy levels of frontier orbitals and hence affect the S 1 state properties.

The CMI mayOPEN ACCESSMolecules 2014, 19 15939 be considered as another influential structural feature which only moderately influences the ground-state properties of bacteriochlorophylls but strongly affects the singlet excitedstate.

The two mechanistic pathways shown in Scheme 2 (pathways A and B) both involve excitation of benzene to S 1 as the first step. One may consider intersystem crossing, but it has been shown experimentally through quenching with various triplet-state quenchers that the photorearrangement does not proceed in the T 1 state, 4 and we can confirm this computationally (vide infra). Moreover, when benzene is excited to the S 2 state, Dewar benzene is formed in addition to benzvalene and fulvene. 23 Hence, one can conclude that an S 1 -state process is likely. In this state, benzene either becomes protonated to form a benzenium cation that rearranges to the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexenium cation 3 (pathway A, Scheme 2), or rearranges to benzvalene 4 45 via the prefulvenic transition state 5 and an S 1 /S 0 conical intersection (pathway B). 46 Both mechanistic pathways involve relief of the S 1 -state antiaromatic character of benzene, but in different ways. Many pieces of evidence have been acquired for pathway A 31,32 and pathway B, 24,33 but no previous study has unambiguously confirmed one mechanism over the other. With regard to ESAA relief, any pathway that allows for disruption of the 6\u03c0electron cycle which is antiaromatic in S 1 will provide for such relief. Which pathway is followed depends on (i) the excitedstate lifetime of S 1 -state benzene, as this determines the effective concentration of the reactive S 1 -state benzene, (ii) the concentration and strength of the acid, and (iii) the activation barriers for the different reaction steps. Thus, ESAA relief combined with other factors (concentrations and excited-state lifetimes) impacts which mechanism is followed. Further factors that can have an impact are the energy penalty for distortion of the \u03c3-framework from the hexagon, which is ideal for sp 2 -hybridized C atoms, and the ability of substituents to reduce the antiaromaticity of a benzene ring in its S 1 state, similar to what was recently found for the T 1 -state antiaromaticity. 47",

Chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes of thylakoid membranes are more complicated because of the large number of chlorophylls that can transfer energy to each other. The interpretation of these lifetimes requires a model of energy transfer in the thylakoid membrane. Gilmore et al. (1995) fit data from thylakoids with and without qE to lifetime distributions centered at 400 ps and 2 ns. The amplitude of the 400 ps component was larger in the ''qE on'' state than in the ''qE off'' state. Because the lifetimes were conserved between the thylakoids in the two states, the lifetimes were interpreted as ''puddles'' of PSIIs that cannot transfer energy to one another. Within a puddle, energy transfer was assumed to occur much faster than any of the decay processes. The faster 400 ps component was attributed to PSIIs that had access to a qE site and was the first assignment of an excited state lifetime for qE. However, the measurement and model were not able to extract detailed information about the energy transfer network with qE on, such as the location(s) of quenching sites.\n\nUnderstanding the energy transfer network with qE on requires a mathematical framework that incorporates that information.

The fluorescence decay F(t) in this formalism is simply the sum of P(t) over all nodes in the network, weighted by the rate of fluorescence at each node (Yang et al. 2003). Knowing K is equivalent to knowing the energy transfer network, and a full understanding of qE requires characterizing the changes in K between dark-and light-adapted grana membranes (see Fig. 6).",

The currently accepted model for this phenomenon is built on a foundation in which the electronic excitation energy of O2(a(1)\u0394g) is transferred to vibrational modes in a solvent molecule, with oxygen returning to its ground electronic state, O2(X(3)\u03a3g(-)). This model of electronic-to-vibrational (e-to-v) energy transfer specifically focusses on the solvent as a \"sink\" for the excitation energy of O2(a(1)\u0394g). On the basis of temperature-dependent changes in the solvent-mediated O2(a(1)\u0394g) lifetime, we demonstrate that this energy-sink-based model has limitations and needs to be re-formulated. We now show that the effect of solvent on the O2(a(1)\u0394g) lifetime is more reasonably interpreted by considering an activation barrier that reflects the extent to which a solvent molecule perturbs the forbidden O2(a(1)\u0394g) \u2192 O2(X(3)\u03a3g(-)) transition. For a given solvent molecule, this barrier reflects contributions from (a) the oxygen-solvent charge transfer state that mediates nonradiative coupling between the O2(a(1)\u0394g) and O2(X(3)\u03a3g(-)) states, and (b) vibrations of specific bonds in the solvent molecule. The latter establishes connectivity to the desirable features of the energy-sink-based model. Moreover, temperature-dependent H/D solvent isotope effects imply that tunneling through this barrier plays a role in the mechanism for O2(a(1)\u0394g) deactivation, even at room temperature. Although we focus on a long-standing problem involving O2(a(1)\u0394g), our results and interpretation touch fundamental issues of interest to chemists at large. ",

The background pressure of our vacuum chamber and the blackbody excitation rate of the rovibrational transitions both support a lifetime longer than a few tens of seconds. The light scattering by the trapping beam should also be fairly weak, and we do not expect it to limit the lifetime below 10 s. The lifetime could be limited by inelastic molecule-molecule and atom-molecule collisions. If the rovibrational ground state 40 K 87 Rb molecules are created in a single hyperfine state, then the Fermi nature of these molecules will preclude their collisions at this ultracold temperature. A possible loss mechanism is the collision of a K atom with a KRb molecule, resulting in a chemical reaction producing a K 2 molecule and a Rb atom. The potential minimum of K 2 molecules [38] is located below that of KRb [37], so that this process is energetically allowed. By removing most of the K atoms, we have measured a typical lifetime of \u03c4 = 70(8) ms for the ground-state polar molecules sitting in the optical dipole trap. Figure 6 shows one such measurement. When we purposely allow K atoms to remain in the same optical trap and when their number is similar to that of the KRb molecules, we observe a decrease of the trap lifetime to below 10 ms. On the other hand, the potential minimum of the Rb 2 molecules is above that of KRb, and introducing Rb atoms to the trapped KRb molecules does not seem to affect the trap lifetime. At this time, we are still searching for the reason behind the 70 ms limit for the lifetime. Planned measurements in the future include the purification of the KRb sample to a single hyperfine state to prevent possible KRb-KRb collisions and the measurement of incoherent scattering of ground-state molecules due to the trapping light.\n\n\nV.

This may be partially explained by comparing the excitation and emission ESTMs in Figure 4A,B, respectively. The emission ESTM indicates a higher sensitivity of the emission energy compared to the absorption. However, to determine if we can reproduce this effect in the QM/MM calculations, we repeated the ASEC-FEG calculations for both iLOV and iLOV-Q430E using the charges and gradient of the S 1 excited state of flavin instead of the S 0 ground state. We computed the S 1 \u2212 S 0 vertical emission energy at the excitedstate S 1 geometry. Note that, due to the use of excited-state charges for the flavin during the MD calculations, the protein adapts to the excited-state charge distribution. The 5 ns MD calculations have a similar time scale as a typical fluorescence lifetime, reflecting the time that the protein takes to rearrange around the excited-state configuration. In this case, it took slightly longer to achieve self-consistency of the ASEC-FEG calculations, so the first three steps were discarded and the excitation energy was averaged over the next four ASEC-FEG steps. The ASEC-FEG calculations indicate that iLOV-Q430E has a ca. 9 nm red-shifted vertical emission wavelength compared to iLOV (Table S3). Inspecting the MD simulations revealed that, on average, the E430 moves closer to the flavin in the excited state than in the ground state. The average distance between flavin's N1 atom and the C atom of the sidechain carboxylate ion is 8.4 \u00c5 for the excited state, compared to 8.9 \u00c5 in the ground-state geometry (E430 abs and E430 fl in Figure 6). Therefore, the more significant Stokes shift in iLOV-Q430E compared to that in iLOV can be attributed to two factors. One is electronic, since the ESTM already shows a higher sensitivity of flavin's S 0 \u2212 S 1 energy difference to charges near the N1 atom after flavin relaxes on its S 1 potential energy surface to the fluorescence minimum ( Figure 4). The second effect comes from the protein rearrangement; the deprotonated E430 is less repelled by the flavin excited state than the ground state and moves slightly closer,",

The triplet state was confirmed by Lewis via application of a magnetic field to the excited phosphor, as only the metastable state would have a long enough lifetime to be analyzed and the phosphor would have only responded if it was paramagnetic due to it having at least one unpaired electron. Their proposed pathway of phosphorescence included the forbidden spin transition occurring when the potential energy curves of the singlet excited state and the triplet excited state crossed, from which the term intersystem crossing arose.

Notably, bonding interactions can also arise from the low-energy scattering of a Rydberg electron with negative scattering length from a ground-state atom. In this case, the scattering-induced attractive interaction binds the ground-state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well-localized position within the Rydberg electron wavefunction and thereby yields giant molecules that can have internuclear separations of several thousand Bohr radii. Here we report the spectroscopic characterization of such exotic molecular states formed by rubidium Rydberg atoms that are in the spherically symmetric s state and have principal quantum numbers, n, between 34 and 40.

The data allow us to extract the s-wave scattering length for scattering between the Rydberg electron and the ground-state atom, Rb(5s), in the low-energy regime (kinetic energy, &lt;100 meV), and to determine the lifetimes and the polarizabilities of the Rydberg molecules. Given our successful characterization of s-wave bound Rydberg states, we anticipate that p-wave bound states, trimer states and bound states involving a Rydberg electron with large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules-will also be realized and directly probed in the near future.",

To mimic the long-lived charge separations characteristic of the reaction center in photosynthesis, researchers have applied the Marcus theory to design synthetic multistep electron-transfer (ET) systems. In this Account, we describe our recent research on the rational design of ET control systems, based on models of the photosynthetic reaction center that rely on the Marcus theory of ET. The key to obtaining a long-lived charge separation is the careful choice of electron donors and acceptors that have small reorganization energies of ET. In these cases, the driving force of back ET is located in the Marcus inverted region, where the lifetime of the charge-separated state lengthens as the driving force of back ET increases. We chose porphyrins as electron donors and fullerenes as electron acceptors, both of which have small ET reorganization energies. By linking electron donor porphyrins and electron acceptor fullerenes at appropriate distances, we achieved charge-separated states with long lifetimes. We could further lengthen the lifetimes of charge-separated states by mixing a variety of components, such as a terminal electron donor, an electron mediator, and an electron acceptor, mimicking both the photosynthetic reaction center and the multistep photoinduced ET that occurs there. However, each step in multistep ET loses a fraction of the initial excitation energy during the long-distance charge separation. To overcome this drawback in multistep ET systems, we used designed new systems where we could finely control the redox potentials and the geometry of simple donor-acceptor dyads. These modifications resulted in a small ET reorganization energy and a high-lying triplet excited state. Our most successful example, 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion (Acr(+)-Mes), can undergo a fast photoinduced ET from the mesityl (Mes) moiety to the singlet excited state of the acridinium ion moiety (Acr(+)) with extremely slow back ET. The high-energy triplet charge-separated state is located deep in the Marcus inverted region, and we have detected the structural changes during the photoinduced ET in this system using X-ray crystallography. To increase the efficiency of both the light-harvesting and photoinduced ET, we assembled the Acr(+)-Mes dyads on gold nanoparticles to bring them in closer proximity to one another. We can also incorporate Acr(+)-Mes molecules within nanosized mesoporous silica-alumina. In contrast to the densely assembled dyads on gold nanoparticles, each Acr(+)-Mes molecule in silica-alumina is isolated in the mesopore, which inhibits the bimolecular back ET and leads to longer lifetimes in solution at room temperature than the natural photosynthetic reaction center. Acr(+)-Mes and related compounds act as excellent organic photocatalysts and facilitate a variety of reactions such as oxygenation, bromination, carbon-carbon bond formation, and hydrogen evolution reactions.",

Predissociation of the B 1IIu state and energy transfer in Cs2 (B 1IIu)+Cs(6S) collisions were studied using methods of atomic and molecular fluorescence. The B 1IIu (v &lt; 10) state does not predissociate in Cs vapor excited at lambda = 736 nm. The decay signal of the time-resolved fluorescence from the B 1IIu --&gt; X 1sigma(g)+ transition was monitored. According to the Stern-Volmer equation, a plot of reciprocal of effective lifetimes of the Cs2 (B 1IIu) state quenched by Cs(6S) atoms against its densities yielded a slope that indicated the total cross section for deactivation and an intercept(at which the Cs pressure is zero) that provided the information on the radiative lifetime of the state. The radiative lifetime is (35 +/- 7)ns for the B 1IIu state. The total cross section for deactivation of excited Cs2 [B 1IIu (v &lt; 10)] molecules by means of collisions with Cs atoms is (4.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(-14) cm2. The B 1IIu (v &gt; 30) state pre-dissociates in Cs vapor excited at lambda = 705 nm. At the different Cs densities, the relative time-integrated intensities of the resulting Cs emission lines, I(6P1/2 --&gt; 6S1/2) [I(D1)] and I(6P3/2 --&gt; 6S1/2) [I(D2)], and Cs2 (B 1IIu) band-pass (725 --&gt; 735 nm) I[Cs2 (B 1IIu)] were measured. By combining Cs 6P fine-structure mixing and quenching induced by collisions with ground Cs atoms, the authors obtained absolute values for predissociation and collisional transfer cross sections. The predissociation rates are (4.3 +/- 1.7) x 10(6) s(-1) (for predissociating to 6P3/2) and (4.7 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) s(-1) (for predissociating to 6P1/2), respectively. The collisional transfer cross sections are (0.45 +/- 0.18) x 10(-14) cm2 (for transfering to 6P1/2) and (4.3 +/- 1.7) x 10(-14) cm2 (for transfering to 6P3/2). These experimental results show that if Cs2 excited state is predissociation state, it can produce Cs(6P) atoms by predissociation and collisional transfer; if Cs2 excited state is bound, it can produce produce Cs(6P) atoms by collisional transfer.",

A brief survey of past researches on different models and theories of bio-energy, including Davydov's, Takeno's, Yomosa's, Brown et al.'s, Schweitzer's, Cruzeiro-Hansson's, Forner's and Pang's models were first stated in this paper. Subsequently we studied and reviewed mainly and systematically the properties, thermal stability and lifetimes of the carriers (solitons) transporting the bio-energy at physiological temperature 300 K in Pang's and Davydov's theories. From these investigations we know that the carrier (soliton) of bio-energy transport in the \u03b1-helical protein molecules in Pang's model has a higher binding energy, higher thermal stability and larger lifetime at 300 K relative to those of Davydov's model, in which the lifetime of the new soliton at 300 K is enough large and belongs to the order of 10(-10) s or \u03c4/\u03c4(0)\u2265700.

The supply disruptions of 99Mo in the late 2000s and the ageing of the producing nuclear reactors forced the industry to look into alternative methods of production. The use of cyclotrons or electron accelerators to produce 99Mo from 100Mo via (p,pn) or (\u03b3,n) reactions, respectively, has been further investigated. The (n,2n) reaction on 100Mo yields a higher reaction cross-section for high energy neutrons than of (n,\u03b3) on 98Mo with thermal neutrons. In particular, this method requires accelerators that generate fast neutron spectrums, such as ones using D-T or other fusion-based reactions, or high energy spallation or knock out reactions. A disadvantage of these techniques is the necessity for enriched 100Mo targets, which are significantly more expensive than natural isotopic targets and typically require recycling of the material, which can be costly, time consuming, and arduous.",

SENJU comprises three choppers, an elliptical shape straight supermirror guide, a vacuum sample chamber and 37 scintillator area detectors.

Neutron production from modern linear accelerators (linacs) has not been extensively compared, particularly in terms of the differences in the strategies that various manufacturers have used to implement multileaf collimators (MLCs) into their linac designs. However, such information is necessary to determine neutron dose equivalents for different linacs and to calculate vault shielding requirements. The purpose of the current study, therefore, was to measure the neutron spectra from the most up-to-date linacs from three manufacturers: Varian 21EX operating at 15, 18, and 20 MV, Siemens ONCOR operating at 15 and 18 MV, and Elekta Precise operating at 15 and 18 MV. Neutron production was measured by means of gold foil activation in Bonner spheres. Based on the measurements, the authors determined neutron spectra and calculated the average energy, total neutron fluence, ambient dose equivalent, and neutron source strength. The shapes of the neutron spectra did not change significantly between accelerators or even as a function of treatment energy. However, the neutron fluence, and therefore the ambient dose equivalent, did vary, increasing with increasing treatment energy. For a given nominal treatment energy, these values were always highest for the Varian linac. The current study thus offers medical physicists extensive information about the neutron production of MLC-equipped linacs currently in operation and provides them information vital for accurate comparison and prediction of neutron dose equivalents and calculation of vault shielding requirements.",

Neutron yield per proton, energy distribution, flux, and dose components in the simulated head phantom were estimated by MCNPX code.

Yet NRS has seldom been used in dynamic experiments. There is a compelling incentive to do so because of the significant shortcomings of alternative techniques. An important barrier to adopting dynamic NRS thermometry is the difficulty in fielding it with conventional spallation neutron sources. To enable time-dependent and spatially resolved temperature measurements in dynamic environments, more compact neutron sources that can be used at user facilities in conjunction with other diagnostic probes (such as x-ray light sources) are required. Such sources may be available using ultrafast high-intensity optical lasers. We evaluate such possibilities by determining the sensitivities of the temperature estimate on neutron-beam and diagnostic parameters. Based on that evaluation, requirements are set on a pulsed neutron-source and diagnostics to make a meaningful dynamic temperature measurement. Dynamic thermometry measurements are examined in this context when driven by two alternative fast-neutron sources: the Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) proton accelerator driving isotropic spallation neutrons as a baseline and a laser-plasma ion accelerator driving a neutron beam from deuterium breakup. Strategies to close the gap between the required and demonstrated performance of laser-based fast-neutron sources are presented. A short-pulse high-intensity laser with state-of-the-art pulse contrast and an energy of a few hundred Joules would drive a compact neutron source suitable for NRS thermometry that could transform the dynamic study of materials.",

However, the lack of high-quality experimental work on the characterisation of such loads prevents a better understanding of many scenarios. Blast loads are typically characterised by use of some form of pressure gauge, from which the temperature can be inferred from a pressure measurement. However, such an approach to temperature measurement is limited; it assumes ideal gas laws apply throughout, which may not be the case for high temperature and pressure scenarios. In contrast, infrared radiation thermometers (IRTs) perform a measurement of temperature based upon the emitted radiance from the target object. The IRTs can measure fast changes in transient temperature, making them seemingly ideal for the measurement of a fireball's temperature. In this work, we present the use of a high-speed IRT for the measurement of early-stage explosive development and fireball expansion within a confined blast, with the temperature of the explosive fireball measured from its emitted radiance. The temperature measured by the IRT was corroborated against the temperature inferred from a pressure gauge measurement; both instruments measured the same temperature from the quasi-static pressure (QSP) point onwards. Before the QSP point, it is deduced that the IRT measures the average temperature of the fireball over a wide field-of-view (FOV), as opposed to that inferred from the singular shocks detected by the pressure gauge. Therefore, use of an IRT, in tandem with a pressure gauge, provides a potential invaluable measurement technique for the characterisation the early stages of a fireball as it develops and expands.",

A partial equilibrium calculation using a hydrodynamical profile with the dramatic temperature rise characterizing a thermonuclear runaway in a Type Ia supernova simulation is illustrated in Fig. 11. The thermonuclear runaway in degenerate white-dwarf matter subjects the reaction network to extreme conditions in this example: the difference between the fastest and slowest reaction timescales is more than 11 orders of magnitude and during the thermonuclear flash the temperature increases by 6.6 billion K in only 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22127 Log Time (s)   s (a rate of temperature change corresponding to 4.4 \u00d7 10 16 K/s). The asymptotic plus PE method required 712 steps to integrate this problem, compared with 524 steps for the implicit calculation, suggesting that an optimized explicit code would be about twice as fast as the implicit code because it can compute a timestep about three times faster. In contrast, the purely asymptotic calculation gave accurate results but required almost 190,000 integration steps for the time range shown. As may be seen from Fig. 11(d), the partial equilibrium calculation becomes completely equilibrated after logt \u223c \u22125.2 and after that time the PE timesteps are limited only by accuracy. Choosing to restrict the subsequent timesteps to dt = 0.3t, continuation of the PE (or implicit) integration of Fig. 11 until the characteristic timescale for the supernova explosion of \u223c 1 s requires only a few tens of additional integration steps. In contrast, if the asymptotic integrator continued to take the timesteps it is taking at the end of the calculation in Fig. 11, it would require more than a billion additional integration steps to reach the full physical timescale for the supernova.\n\n\nSynopsis",

More specifically, a SNIa is the result of a thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf 6 . While in a perfect gas at fixed volume the temperature and pressure balance each other (PV = nRT ), in white dwarfs the matter is degenerate. As a consequence, if the temperature increases up to the C combustion threshold, a chain reaction will trigger the explosive burning of elements in the white dwarf, up to (and especially) its Fe-peak elements, leaving no remnant after the explosion. This way, SNIa act like thermonuclear bombs, and the energy of their explosion (i.e. their luminosity) should not depend on their intrinsic properties. For this reason, they are useful standard candles to estimate cosmic distances accurately (see also Chapter: X-ray cluster cosmology).\n\nWhat is not clear yet, however, is the exact scenario preceding the SNIa explosion. Is the white dwarf steadily accreting material from a main sequence companion until reaching the C burning temperature (the \"single degenerate scenario\") or is this burning triggered by a violent merger between two white dwarfs (the \"double degenerate scenario\")? Whereas the former scenario is generally expected for white dwarf explosions close to the Chandrasekhar mass (\u223c1.4 M ; near-Chandrasekhar models), the latter is expected to occur at lower mass (sub-Chandrasekhar models). A complete review on this unsolved issue can be found in Maoz et al. [53]. Another debate stands on the physics of the explosion itself. In fact, while the general consensus is that the burning flame starts to propagate subsonically, it is not clear whether it always remains so (i.e. \"deflagration\" models) or whether it reaches a supersonic velocity before disintegrating the white dwarf (i.e. \"delayed-detonation\" models).",

Detailed numerical simulations of the first 3 min of the explosion were performed using the astrophysical hydrodynamics program ZEUS-3D. Our numerical simulations begin either with hot cylinders with dimensions suggested by the disruption and deceleration model or with an initial wake constructed from a moving line charge. In all cases, extensive plumes of hot gas are expelled from the atmosphere. The models with wakes evolve about twice as fast as the initially confined models. Models of both types generate similar pressure waves into the planet. Temperatures and negative hydrogen ion opacities were computed by solving a battery of Saha equations. For atmospheric entry, light curves were computed assuming thermal radiation by clean jovian air with a surface area consistent with the (changing) cross-sectional area of the impactor. On entry the largest bolides could be very bright, possibly as bright as Jupiter for observers placed to see them, although for kilometer-size impactors the luminosity peak is obscured by clouds. The timescale is about 10 sec. For the fireball, light curves were computed from the numerical simulations assuming a grey atmosphere. Metals from the vaporized comet provide electrons that dramatically increase the opacity of Jovian air at low temperature; the resulting effective radiating temperature of the fireball is of order 3000 K.

The computations show that, after a short transient stage, imposed perturbations travel with the same velocity as the leading contact line.

The nuclear runaway that leads to the explosion could start in a white dwarf gradually accumulating matter from a companion star until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit, or could be triggered by the merger of two white dwarfs in a compact binary system. The X-ray signatures of these two possible paths are very different. Whereas no strong electromagnetic emission is expected in the merger scenario until shortly before the supernova, the white dwarf accreting material from the normal star becomes a source of copious X-rays for about 10(7) years before the explosion. This offers a means of determining which path dominates. Here we report that the observed X-ray flux from six nearby elliptical galaxies and galaxy bulges is a factor of approximately 30-50 less than predicted in the accretion scenario, based upon an estimate of the supernova rate from their K-band luminosities. We conclude that no more than about five per cent of type Ia supernovae in early-type galaxies can be produced by white dwarfs in accreting binary systems, unless their progenitors are much younger than the bulk of the stellar population in these galaxies, or explosions of sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs make a significant contribution to the supernova rate.",

These are shown in Fig. 8 as functions of density. Both L min CJ and U CJ depend only on the mixture properties, which vary with local density. L CJ and U max l also depend on the turbulent integral scale l and velocity U l . They were calculated assuming l = 10 km and U l = 100 km s \u22121 , values found in large-scale calculations of the M ch explosions (51,52,75). The lack of fully developed turbulence on scales > 10 km greatly reduces flame packing on these scales. Figure 8 shows that L min CJ decreases below l = 10 km at densities > 10 7 g cm \u22123 , thus allowing the CJ conditions to arise in the flow (76). As the density increases, the minimum size of the critical flame region decreases rapidly. At \u03c1 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 7 g cm \u22123 , turbulent integral velocity U max l at the scale of 10 km required to produce tight flame packing associated with L min CJ becomes larger than the reference U l = 100 km s \u22121 . Therefore, at higher densities, high turbulent intensities not observed in full-star SNIa simulations (51,52,75) would be required 13 to pack the flame sufficiently tightly to achieve L min CJ . CJ conditions can be created by the turbulent intensity of 100 km s \u22121 , though they would correspond to a less tightly packed flame and a larger critical flame volume L CJ . Corresponding values of L CJ for the reference U l = 100 km s \u22121 , that we denote L ref CJ , as well as the turbulent velocity U CJ at that scale, are also shown in Fig. 8. After the critical flame volume reaches a minimum value at \u03c1 \u2248 3 \u00d7 10 7 g cm \u22123 , it starts growing again, becoming larger than 10 km at \u03c1 \u2248 1.5 \u00d7 10 8 g cm \u22123 .",

This study considers the interaction of a thermonuclear flame, driven by 12 C-12 C reactions, with steady driven turbulence under the conditions characteristic of the interior of a white dwarf during the late stages of the type Ia supernova explosion. In the fastest turbulence case, the value of U l /S L \u2248 70 was achieved corresponding to the Karlovitz number Ka = 228, where Ka = (\u03b4 L /L G ) 1 / 2 and L G is the Gibson scale defined in eq. (11). This simulation showed the formation of a broad turbulent flame with a complex temperature and burning-rate structure. Moreover, joint PDFs of various quantities, such as carbon mass fraction and temperature, were characteristic of a Lewis number Le = 1 system, whereas the actual values of Le are extremely large. This fact, along with wide smooth averaged profiles of various quantities throughout the turbulent flame, led to the conclusion that the resulting flame is dominated by turbulent transport and presents an example of a broad distributed reaction zone.\n\nEven given the efforts discussed above, the physics of high-speed turbulent combustion still has many unanswered questions. With the exception of the experimental results of [10] and numerical results of [15], evidence of significant flame broadening and the formation of distributed reaction zones is scarce [5]. Moreover, results of all studies suggest that such broadening, even if it does occur, requires substantially higher turbulent intensities than traditionally predicted. It remains unclear whether the effects of turbulence are indeed so much weaker than can be expected based on simple physical grounds and, if this is the case, what mechanisms are responsible for suppressing the action of turbulence.\n\nThe work by [10] and [15] emphasizes the importance of detailed and reliable diagnostics. While both studies present interesting experimental and numerical investigations of the previously unexplored regimes, they both rely on indirect evidence in their determination of the observed flame broadening. Of paramount importance are the measurements that would, for example, directly answer questions regarding the actual multidimensional structure of the region in which most of the energy release takes place, the nature of flame broadening, and the effects of turbulence on different regions of the flame.",

Notably, as K G is obtained based on the product of the maximum pressure boost rate parameter and the volume constant of each group of mixed systems, the trends and amplitudes of both are consistent. Therefore, the following subsection will focus on the analysis of the maximum pressure boost rate parameters. As shown in Figure 3, in the lean methane system, the addition of hydrogen (group M1) promoted the explosion of 7% methane. The peak explosive overpressure of the mixed system increases with further addition, and the time required to reach the peak pressure decreases. After adding carbon monoxide (group M7), with the increase in the addition amount, the explosion of 7% methane showed a trend of initial inhibition and then promotion, which is consistent with previous experiments by Deng et al. 29 that CO has a certain damping effect on methane\u2212air explosion. However, the difference is that when CO reaches a certain amount of addition, its damping effect does not appear, but its promoting effect is more significant. Figure 4 shows the effect of each ratio of H 2 /CO on the explosion pressure parameters of 7% methane. Overall, all groups of H 2 /CO, except M7 (pure carbon monoxide), showed a significant contribution to the 7% methane explosion overpressure peak and maximum ramp rate, and the R-value reached the maximum extent at approximately 60% and then appeared to be substantially weakened with an increasing Rvalue. As mentioned above, the addition of the M7 group has obvious stage effects on the explosion of 7% methane. When the R-value is lower than 30%, the pressure parameter of the system initially decreases and then rises slightly. Therefore, within this range of addition, the influence of CO is mainly the damping effect; when the R-value increases to 50\u221280%, the promoting effect begins to gradually appear, and the pressure parameter increases to the maximum value. When the R-value of the M7 group is 85%, and the corresponding CO volume fraction reaches 39%, the system still has the ability to explode, while other groups of H 2 /CO with the same R-value have made the mixed system no longer explode.

There also seemed to be little difference between the cases at fixed Bi as Ra varied. To elucidate further these effects, simulations were performed to capture the maximum temperature that occurs in the steady state for a stable solution on the explosion boundary (such as is shown in Fig. 1). This was done for a range of Bi and at three values of Ra, i.e. 10 3 , 10 4 and 10 5 . The results are plotted in Fig. 4. When Bi = 0, the system is perfectly mixed and as predicted by Semenov, 1 the maximum dimensionless temperature of a stable system is 1. When Bi is increased, it is clear that there is an increase in the maximum temperature that can be achieved before explosion occurs. Indeed, for Bi 4 5, for the range of Ra considered, it can be seen that the maximum temperature rises above the value of 1.6 that was predicted by Frank-Kamenetskii 2 for a purely diffusive system. For each Ra when Bi o B10 there is very little difference in the maximum temperatures achievable in a nonexplosive case. What is interesting to note, however, is that the maximum temperature for each Bi in this range is actually seen for the lowest value of Ra. This result is somewhat counterintuitive and will be discussed further below. Of course, it should be borne in mind that these maximum temperatures were derived numerically and the maximum temperature is sensitive to the proximity to the explosion boundary, nevertheless the trend is evident for all Bi o 10. This trend is reversed as Bi increases above 20, where the increased intensity of convection indicated by a larger Ra results in a higher temperature being achieved in a stable reaction. When Bi increases above 25, the maximum temperatures achieved diverge and the effect of the more intense convection is obvious. The maximum temperatures then clearly approach the values achieved in a constant wall temperature case (i.e. Bi = N) asymptotically. Thus, for Ra = 10 3 , the maximum temperature is approximately 2.5, for Ra = 10 4 it is 3.15 and for Ra = 10 5 it is 3.45. Unsurprisingly,",

In these systems the donor star is accreting material onto its compact partner star. The accreted material is usually rich in hydrogen and helium because of its origin from the surface layers of the donor star. Because such compact stars have high gravitational fields, the material falls with a high velocity towards the compact star, usually colliding with other accreted material en route, forming an accretion disk. In the case of accretion onto a neutron star, as this material slowly builds up on the surface, it will have a high temperature, typically around 108 K. Eventually, it is believed that thermonuclear instabilities arise in this hot atmosphere, allowing the temperature to continue to rise until it leads to a runaway thermonuclear explosion of the hydrogen and helium. During the flash, the temperature quickly rises, becoming high enough for the rp-process to occur. While the",

Propagating such a shock through a 3D turbulent flame until detonation ignites is computationally expensive. Therefore, we demonstrate this process in a 2D calculation, in which a turbulent flame is represented by a series of spherical flames. An additional benefit of considering this problem in 2D is that we can model this process at a density \u03c1 = 3\u00d710 7 g cm \u22123 and in a realistic 50/50 12 C/ 16 O composition, which are closer to the DDT conditions expected in SNIa.

Such a configuration represents a loosely packed flame.

Similar resolution was used in prior detonation studies, where it was shown to reproduce the detonation velocity and resolve the characteristic multidimensional cellular structure of unstable thermonuclear detonations (73). The size of such detonation cells is \u2248 3 cm (73) resulting in \u2248 2.4 detonation cells in the 7.2 cm wide channel. The corresponding resolution of a laminar flame is 9.3 computational cells per \u03b4 L . The initial flame configuration is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 6.",

Each of these terms is at least 1/n, and since there are n/2 of them they sum to at least 1/2.

It can be shown that, no matter what the choice of weights in a Brun- or Selberg-type sieve, the upper bound obtained will be at least (2 + o(1)) x / ln x for both problems. But in fact the set with an even number of factors is empty and so has size 0. The set with an odd number of factors is just the primes between x1/2 and x, so by the prime number theorem its size is (1 + o(1)) x / ln x. Thus these sieve methods are unable to give a useful upper bound for the first set, and overestimate the upper bound on the second set by a factor of 2.",

The theoretical monoisotopic mass of a molecule is computed by taking the sum of the accurate masses (including mass defect) of the most abundant naturally occurring stable isotope of each atom in the molecule. For small molecules made up of low atomic number elements the monoisotopic mass is observable as an isotopically pure peak in a mass spectrum. This differs from the nominal molecular mass, which is the sum of the mass number of the primary isotope of each atom in the molecule and is an integer. It also is different from the molar mass, which is a type of average mass. For some atoms like carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulfur the Mmi of these elements is exactly the same as the mass of its natural isotope, which is the lightest one. However, this does not hold true for all atoms. Iron's most common isotope has a mass number of 56, while the stable isotopes of iron vary in mass",

Observation of the bacterial light with a small spectroscope and rather wide slit showed a broad band with red and blue at the ends. As the slit was narrowed the band becomes smaller and its center is at about X = .51~. The lamp was run at 5.5 volts and a measurement 1 of the transmission of the No. 62 green filter at this color temperature gave .05 transmission. To calibrate the lamp, a careful measurement of the illumination (without the No. 62 green filter) on the opal glass comparison screen was made with a Macbeth illuminometer with the lamp at a given distance, and the inverse square law applied for other distances. The Macbeth illuminometer read directly in foot candles.

In the considered setup T 2L 1 h/M v z S 2 amounts to 1 \u00b5m for PEA (M = 121.18 amu) at a jet velocity v z of 650 m/s. This is 8 times the grating period \u03bb L /2 of the standing laser wave with a wavelength \u03bb L = 266 nm. The grating can be generated by a narrow-band pulsed UV laser (100 Hz repetition rate, 10 ns pulse length), tuned with a bandwidth and resolution of better than 0.1 cm \u22121 . Frequencydoubled dye lasers meet these requirements. At the grating the molecules are diffracted according to their de Broglie wavelength \u03bb dB 5 pm. The rotational alignment of the grating mirror is determined by the pulse length of the laser and the collimation of the beam and has to be better than 20 \u00b5rad. After traversing the grating, the molecular wave propagates the distance L 2 before it impinges onto a mask with two adjustable slits. These select, for instance, the first order diffraction peak on either side of the center, separated according to the diffraction angle \u03b8 diff \u2248 \u03bb/d = 30 \u00b5rad.",

Given the limited spectral resolution inherent in our detection  technique and only fair spatial resolution these trends are at best an indication of the size distribution of the BL emitters. We defer a more complete analysis of the spectral variation of the BL spectrum until after completion of an ongoing program in collaboration with D.G. York which maps the complete RR nebula with dense spatial coverage using the 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. Figure 4a shows the distribution of the ratio of bandintegrated BL to the total scattered light in the same band at various positions along the two slits. Figure 4b illustrates the spatial distribution of the BL and the scattered light intensities on a normalized scale. Due to the anisotropy of the phase function, scattered light is strongly forward directed and falls off steeply as we probe regions where our line of sight penetrates regions of the nebula where larger scattering angles predominate. The BL, on the other hand is due to fluorescence and is an isotropic emission and thus falls off less steeply. Thus, the spatial variation of the BL and scattered light along the two slits reveals the isotropic nature of the BL. Therefore, the ratio I BL /I Scat increases away from the star, whereas the actual intensities fall away from the star as the density of emitters and the exciting radiation both decrease. It is equally illuminating to note that the BL intensities have similar profiles along the two slits, whereas the distribution of the scattered light it quite different; along the slit closer to the star, the scattered light falls off more steeply than along the second slit as the relative change in the distance from the central star varies more slowly in the latter case. Figure 5 displays the spatial distribution of the bandintegrated intensities of ERE and the BL along the two slits and the 3.3 \u00b5m UIR-band emission along a 5 \u2032\u2032 south (PA=-85 \u2022 ) slit ( Fig. 1 and 2 show the apertures).

The flash of light from the spark passing through a small hole gives an instantaneous excitation to a small mass of mercury vapour which is moving upward with a high velocity. By the time it bursts into luminosity it has already moved up a short distance, and as it continues to ascend, the moving lens carries its image to the right. The tangent of the angle which the oblique image thus formed makes with a horizontal line is the ratio of the velocity of the vapour to that of the lens, and this angle was found to be about 23\u00b0. This gave 17 metres per second as the velocity of the vapour. Observations of the fluorescent flame showed that the luminosity commenced about 1-5 mm. above the excited region. This gives us for the time interval 1/11,400 second, a value somewhat\" smaller than the one obtained by the first method. The former is probably more nearly exact. A small bulb was now substituted for the inverted U-tube, heated by a column of hot air rising from an asbestos chimney. The spark was placed close to the bulb, and the fluorescence occurs chiefly on the inner surface on the side facing the spark (superficial fluorescence) owing to the density of the vapour.The whole slit was simultaneously illuminated by the fluorescent light under these conditions, and it was expected that the image seen with the moving lens would appear as in Plate 5,fig. 6. I t was found, however, that the band of green fluorescent light was joined to the image of the slit formed by the light (white) of the spark scattered by the walls of the bulb. This explained at once the difficulty found in getting results by the first method, in which the bulb was viewed through a narrow slit in the disc. The greater density of the vapour in this case evidently reduces the time interval between absorption and emission to something less than 1/40,000 of a second, as this would give a displacement of a millimetre, which could be observed without difficulty. A vertical tube of quartz about 2 cm. in diameter and 10 cm. long, was now substituted for the bulb, and the pool of mercury at the bottom heated by a small flame.

Currently, different instrumentation and methods can yield very different results when measuring the same feature such as color uniformity or color difference. As color increasingly comes into play in medical imaging diagnostics, display color will have to be quantified in order to assess whether the display should be used for imaging purposes. The authors report on the characterization of three novel probes for measuring display color with minimal contamination from screen areas outside the measurement spot or from off-normal emissions. They compare three probe designs: A modified small-spot luminance probe and two conic probe designs based on black frusta. To compare the three color probe designs, spectral and luminance measurements were taken with specialized instrumentation to determine the luminance changes and color separation abilities of the probes. The probes were characterized with a scanning slit method, veiling glare, and a moving laser and LED arrangement. The scanning slit measurement was done using a black slit plate over a white line on an LCD monitor. The luminance was measured in 1 mm increments from the center of the slit to +/- 15 mm above and below the slit at different distances between the probe and the slit. The veiling glare setup consisted of measurements of the luminance of a black spot pattern with a white disk of radius of 100 mm as the black spot increases in 1 mm radius increments. The moving LED and laser method consisted of a red and green light orthogonal to the probe tip for the light to directly shine into the probe. The green light source was moved away from the red source in 1 cm increments to measure color stray-light contamination at different probe distances. The results of the color testing using the LED and laser methods suggest a better performance of one of the frusta probes at shorter distances between the light sources, which translates to less contamination. The tails of the scans indicate the magnitude of the spread in signal due to light from areas outside the intended measurement spot. The measurements indicate a corresponding glare factor for a large spot of 140, 500, and 2000 for probe A, B1, and B2, respectively. The dual-laser setup suggests that color purity can be maintained up to a few tens of millimeters outside the measurement spot. The comparison shows that there are significant differences in the performance of each probe design, and that those differences have an effect on the measured quantity used to quantify display color. Different probe designs show different measurements of the level of light contamination that affects the quantitative color determination.",

The increase in the number of grooves reduced the transmission spectra, based on resonant Bragg scattering, that generates SPPs for specific wavelengths 37 . As shown in Fig. 2e, the transmission through a one-groove structure could be much greater than predicted by two-groove or three-groove structures. Therefore, only one-groove was applied for all the samples.  By normal illumination of the broadband light source on the interferometer, the produced SPPs traveled via the surface, and propagate to the slit, where SPPs and the direct light interfere together and modulate the far-field transmission. The SPP beam (E SPP ) interfered with the incident beam (E Light ) at the slit position. The calculated normalized intensity in L = 850 nm is presented in Fig. 3a.

The control over beam shape allows analysis of various channel dimensions using the same setup.The divergence used in most experiments was 5 degrees, which was found to yield an illuminated line of approximately 500 micron in height along the axis of the slit of the spectrometer.This illumination size corresponds well with the dimensions of the microchannel used in the experiments described below (300-400 micron).A key aspect of the line-shape illumination is that the orientation of the long axis of the excitation beam is parallel to the entrance slit of the spectrograph.If the illumination is not parallel with the spectrograph slit, the image will be clipped as in the case of the 90 \u2022 (orthogonal) line orientation in Figure S1.The orthogonal orientation effectively crops Raman scattering from either side of the confocal volume.During alignment, the spectrometer slit width was set to 2500 micron, with the grating at zero order (hence acting as a mirror), to collect light from the entire volume illuminated by the beam, to facilitate beam alignment.",

The suction-electrode method used for recording from vertebrate rods was applied to fly ommatidia. A single ommatidium in vitro was partially sucked into a recording pipette. Illumination of the portion of the ommatidium within the pipette resulted in a flow of current having a wave form similar to that of the receptor potential and polarity consistent with current flow into the illuminated region of the photoreceptors. Two 5-microns slits of light, positioned at right angles to the ommatidial axis, were employed to determine the spread of light adaptation or inactivation along the ommatidium. The intensity of a flash of light delivered to one (adapting) slit was adjusted until it produced a criterion fractional reduction in the response to the other (test) slit. The reciprocal of this intensity of the adapting slit was taken as a measure of the effectiveness of the slit in causing light adaptation or inactivation. The effectiveness of the slit in causing light adaptation in normal Musca ommatidia fell as the adapting and test slits were moved farther apart along the ommatidial axis, declining to half its maximal value at a distance of 13 +/- 2 microns. Similar measurements of the effectiveness of a slit in causing light-induced inactivation in the nss mutant of Lucilia also demonstrated localization, declining to half its maximal value at a distance between the slits of 9 +/- 1 microns. Neither light adaptation nor inactivation by the nss mutation, therefore, appear to be mediated by voltage or by a highly diffusible agent. The results are consistent with the idea that inactivation by the nss mutation replaces adaptation in the mutant photoreceptors.",

Since neither of these suggestions can fully explain the function of this pupil across the entire visual field, particularly the frontal and caudal periphery, we re-addressed the question of its functional significance. We took infra-red images of the eyes of live S. officinalis at different light intensities and from different viewing angles. This allowed us to determine the shape and light-admitting area of the pupil for different parts of the visual field. Our data show that the W-shaped pupil projects a blurred \"W\" directly onto the retina and that it effectively operates as vertical slits for the frontal and caudal parts of the visual field. We also took images of the natural habitat of S. officinalis and calculated the average vertical brightness distribution in the visual habitat. Computing a retinal illumination map shows that the W-shaped pupil is effective in balancing a vertically uneven light field: The constricted pupil reduces light from the dorsal part of the visual field significantly more than it reduces light from the horizontal band. This will cut the amount of direct sunlight that is scattered by the lens and ocular media, and thus improve image contrast particularly for the dimmer parts of the scene. We also conclude that the pupil provides even attenuation along the horizontal band, whereas a circular pupil would attenuate the image relatively more in the important frontal and caudal periphery of the visual field.",

This makes it possible to calculate the mass of the nucleus hit by the alpha particle. Light elements absorb more energy of the alpha particle, while alpha particles are reflected by heavy nuclei nearly with the same energy. The energy spectrum of the scattered alpha particle shows peaks from 25% up to nearly 100% of the initial alpha particles.

Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling \u03b2 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

A neutralising electron gun would produce a tiny amount of thrust with high specific impulse in the order of millions of seconds due to the high relativistic speed of alpha particles. A variant of this uses a graphite-based grid with a static DC high voltage to increase thrust as graphite has high transparency to alpha particles if it is also irradiated with short wave UV light at the correct wavelength from a solid state emitter. It also permits lower energy and longer half life sources which would be advantageous for a space application. Helium backfill has also been suggested as a way to increase electron mean free path.

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer \u2113 = 0 and \u2113 = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases.

This fact is of great practical importance for radiation therapy. The range of alpha particles in ambient air amounts to only several centimeters; this type of radiation can therefore be stopped by a sheet of paper.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states.

The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies.

In the incredibly high-density fuel mass, the alpha particles cannot travel far before their electrical charge interacting with the surrounding plasma causes them to lose velocity. This transfer of kinetic energy heats the surrounding particles to the energies they need to undergo fusion as well. This process causes the fusion fuel to burn outward from the center. The electrically neutral neutrons travel longer distances in the fuel mass and do not contribute to this self-heating process.

Derivation A simple way to derive this law is to consider an alpha particle in the atomic nucleus as a particle in a box. The particle is in a bound state because of the presence of the strong interaction potential. It will constantly bounce from one side to the other, and due to the possibility of quantum tunneling by the wave through the potential barrier, each time it bounces, there will be a small likelihood for it to escape. A knowledge of this quantum mechanical effect enables one to obtain this law, including coefficients, via direct calculation. This calculation was first performed by physicist George Gamow in 1928.

The energy stored in the angular momentum of an atomic nucleus can also be responsible for the emission of larger-than-expected particles, such as alpha particles over single nucleons, because they can carry away angular momentum more effectively.

The primary contribution of this study is to investigate the tumour control probability (TCP), relapse time and the corresponding secondary cancer risks induced by proton beam radiation therapy. We incorporate tumour relapse kinetics into the TCP framework and calculate the associated second cancer risks. To calculate proton therapy-induced secondary cancer induction, we used the well-known biologically motivated mathematical model, initiation-inactivation-proliferation formalism. We used the available in vitro data for the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of cell killing and mutation induction parameters. We evaluated the TCP and radiation-induced second cancer risks for protons in the clinical range of LETs, i.e. approximately 8 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the tumour volume and 1-3 $\\mathrm{keV/\\mu m}$ for the organs at risk. This study may serve as a framework for further work in this field and elucidates proton-induced TCP and the associated secondary cancer risks, not previously reported in the literature. Although studies with a greater number of cell lines would reduce uncertainties within the model parameters, we argue that the theoretical framework presented within is a sufficient rationale to assess proton radiation TCP, relapse and carcinogenic effects in various treatment plans. We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.",

The proposed CMOS biosensor is implemented in $\\mathrm {a}0 .18- \\mu m$ CMOS technology, consuming $41 \\mu W$ from $\\mathrm {a}1 .8- V$ supply voltage, while achieving a peak dynamic range of $86 dB$ over a $50- Hz$ input bandwidth at a 20-kS/s sampling rate. This new interface opens new avenues for conducting in-vivo experiments with live animals.",

Other pathologies are thought to be treatable through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), such as heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, inflammation or auto-immune diseases. However, the efficacy of the stimulation is not always optimal, partly due to the materials and the architecture of currently available electrodes. Standard electrodes, composed of metallic rings that stimulate the whole diameter of the nerve, are not adapted to experimentations involving spatial selectivity. Efficient and selective charge injection is usually difficult to achieve simultaneously, especially in experimental setups using rodents, due to the thin diameter of their VN. In this paper, we show that we can take advantage of the high charge injection property of conducting polymers to acutely stimulate the vagus nerve in rodents, using individual active electrodes with dimensions $725\\,\\,\\mu \\mathrm{m}\\times \\,450\\,\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. A particular PEDOT:PSS architecture integrating 12 active electrodes is developed and applied to the VN of one rat. A closed-loop VNS system developed in our previous works is used to stimulate the VN while analyzing the heart rate response. Results show the feasibility of this kind of electrodes for acute VNS on rodents and open the path towards new experimentations focused on selective stimulation and recording.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009\u00b10.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01\u00b1 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Computational models are particularly well suited for these investigations. The electric field can be accurately described by mathematical formalisms, and the population-based neural responses to the electrical stimulation can be investigated at resolutions well beyond those achievable by current state-of-the-art biological techniques. In this study, we used a biophysically-and morphologically-detailed RGC model to explore the ability of high frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) to preferentially activate ON and OFF RGC subtypes, the two major information pathways of the retina. The performance of a wide range of electrical stimulation amplitudes (0 - $100~\\mu \\mathbf {A}$) and frequencies (1 - 10 kHz) on functionally-distinct RGC responses were evaluated. We found that ON RGCs could be preferentially activated at relatively higher stimulation amplitudes $( &gt; 50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ and frequencies $( &gt;2$ kHz) while OFF RGCs were activated by lower stimulation amplitudes (10 to $50 {\\mu } \\mathrm {A})$ across all tested frequencies. These stimuli also show great promise in eliciting RGC responses that parallel RGC encoding: one RGC type exhibited an increase in spiking activity during electrical stimulation whilst another exhibited decreased spiking activity, given the same stimulation parameters.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen.

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia.

CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression.

Spine density and spine head volume were also increased at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and decreased at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$. This specific sequence of events reflects a continuous joint evolution of activity and connectivity that is characteristic of the model of homeostatic structural plasticity.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives. Cs and CD measurements were obtained from the left carotid artery. A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV. The absolute values of Cs and CD were within a range of 3.39 m/s to 7.5 m/s and 3.12 m/s to 5.82 m/s respectively. Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories. Study results demonstrated that the proposed approach has a potential to provide valuable surrogate markers for cardiovascular risk assessment.",

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values.

The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork. We found that the sensation threshold estimated by PeriVib correlated well with the Biothesiometer ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.68) but less well with the tuning fork ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.15). Functional gait and balance metrics did not correlate with peripheral neuropathy severity.",

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

A pool of total mass attenuation and energy absorption coefficients (for photons) and total mass stopping powers (for charged particles) for elements was constructed first. Then, a matrix of interaction cross sections for elements Z\u2009=\u20091-92 was constructed. Finally, effective atomic numbers were calculated for any material by interpolating adjacent cross sections through a linear logarithmic interpolation formula. The results for [Formula: see text] for photon interaction were compared with those calculated through Mayneord's formula, which suggests a single-valued [Formula: see text] for any material for low-energy photons for which photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction process. The single-valued [Formula: see text] was found to agree well with that obtained by other methods, in the low-energy region. In addition, [Formula: see text] values of various materials of biological interest were compared with those obtained experimentally at 59.54\u00a0keV. In general, the agreement between values calculated with Phy-X/ZeXTRa and Auto-Zeff and those measured were satisfactory. A comparison of [Formula: see text] values for photon energy absorption calculated with Phy-X/ZeXTRa and literature values for a nucleotide base, adenine, was made, and the relative difference (RD) in [Formula: see text] between Phy-X/ZeXTRa and literature values was found to be 2%\u2009&lt;\u2009RD\u2009&lt;\u200911%, at low photon energies (1-100\u00a0keV), while it was less than 1% at energies higher than 100\u00a0keV. Highest [Formula: see text] values were observed at low photon energies, where photoelectric absorption dominates photon interaction. For electrons, corresponding RD(%) values in [Formula: see text] were found to be in the range 0.4 \u2264 RD(%) \u2264 1.7, while for heavy charged particle interactions it was 2.4 \u2264 RD(%) \u2264 4.2 for total proton interaction and 0 \u2264 RD(%) \u2264 8 for total alpha particle interaction. In view of the importance of [Formula: see text] for identifying and differentiating tissues in diagnostic imaging as well as for estimating accurate dose in radiotherapy and particle-beam therapy, Phy-X/ZeXTRa could be used for fast and accurate calculation of [Formula: see text] in a wide energy range for both photon and charged particle (electrons, protons, alpha particles and C ions) interactions.",

The WH theory can differ substantially from the predictions of KN and the RIA in the tens of keV range (e.g. 6%-10% at 20 keV), when Compton scattering becomes the dominant interaction mechanism. For lower energies, the disagreement further grows to about one order of magnitude at 1 keV.

A shorter wavelength will transfer more energy to the quantum system than longer wavelengths. On the atomic and molecular scale photoexcitation is the photoelectrochemical process of electron excitation by photon absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization. The absorption of the photon takes place in accordance with Planck's quantum theory.",

For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet, partially hybridized with graphene phonons and surface phonons of the neighboring materials, allow for the control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime from [Formula: see text] to 12 [Formula: see text]m by adjusting the size of and distance between the circular holes in a hexagonal or square lattice structure. Most importantly, the LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources operating in the near-infrared by at least a factor of 100. According to our COMSOL calculations, a maximum emission power per area of [Formula: see text] W/[Formula: see text] at [Formula: see text] K for a bias voltage of [Formula: see text] V is achieved by controlling the temperature of the hot electrons through the Joule heating. By generalizing Planck's theory to any grey body and deriving the completely general nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface plasmons in the random phase approximation, we show that the coherence length of the graphene plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 [Formula: see text]m and 150 [Formula: see text]m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays made of nanoantennas represented by the holes in NPG. The spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal emission in the range between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] by tuning the Fermi energy between [Formula: see text] eV and [Formula: see text] eV through the gate voltage. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are frequency-dependent.

This study was designed to develop a model based on a survey of experimental data that can reliably predict this trend.

We determined model parameters by fitting the model to 139 measured (<i\u03b1,\u03b2</i) pairs. We tested nine versions of the model.

Using the TOT technique, as a measure of energy loss instead of charge integration methods, significantly reduces the signal readout costs by combining the time and energy information. Therefore, this approach can potentially be utilized in J-PET tomograph which is built from plastic scintillators characterized by fast light signals. The drawback in adopting this technique lies in the non-linear correlation between input energy loss and TOT of the signal. The main motivation behind this work is to develop the relationship between TOT and energy loss and validate it by the J-PET tomograph setup. The experiment was performed using a <sup22</supNa beta emitter source placed in the center of the J-PET tomograph. This isotope produces photons of two different energies: 511 keV photons from the positron annihilation (direct annihilation or through the formation of a para-positronium atom or pick-off process of ortho-positronium atoms) and a 1275 keV prompt photon. This allows the study of the correlation between TOT values and energy loss for energy ranges up to 1000 keV. Since the photon interacts predominantly via Compton scattering inside the plastic scintillator, there is no direct information of the energy deposition. However, using the J-PET geometry, one can measure the scattering angle of the interacting photon. Since the <sup22</supNa source emits photons of two different energies, it is necessary to know unambiguously the energy of incident photons and their corresponding scattering angles in order to estimate energy deposition. In summary, this work presents a dedicated algorithm developed to tag photons of different energies and studying their scattering angles to calculate the energy deposition by the interacting photons. A new method was elaborated to measure the energy loss by photons interacting with plastic scintillators used in the J-PET tomograph. We find the relationship between the energy loss and TOT is non-linear and can be described by the functions TOT = A0 + A1 * ln(E <subdep</sub + A2) + A3 * (ln(E <subdep</sub + A2))<sup2</sup and TOT = A0 - A1 * A2[Formula: see text]. In addition, we also introduced a theoretical model to calculate the TOT as a function of energy loss in plastic scintillators.

The corresponding photon-ionization threshold for the transient KRb * 2 complexes at the incident collision energy is \u223c402 nm. Because of this, the 354.85 nm ionization wavelength utilized here has a sufficient photon energy to ionize both transient and deeply bound states of the complex. To confirm that the KRb + 2 ion signal observed in the main text arises from transient collision complexes (KRb * 2 ), and not from more deeply bound complexes, we have also performed measurements analogous to those shown in Fig. 4(a) of the main text using a pulsed UV ionization laser operating at 394.81 nm. At this ionization wavelength, the KRb + 2 ion signal demonstrates the same behavior as that shown in Fig. 4(a), and we observe no measurable difference between the corresponding KRb * 2 complex lifetimes. However, the overall strength of the KRb + 2 ion signal at this wavelength is relatively reduced due to limitations in the available 394.81 nm laser power. We therefore find it sufficient for the purposes of this work to operate the pulsed ionization laser at 354.85 nm, which provides a higher time-averaged laser power.\n\n\nODT INTENSITY MODULATION SCHEME\n\nFor the data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 of the main text, we apply a 1.5 kHz square-wave intensity modulation with a 25% duty cycle to the H and V ODTs using acousto-optic modulators (AOMs). Both beams are always modulated synchronously, so that they follow the same timing. We do this in order to probe the KRb * 2 population at lower, controllable 1064 nm intensity levels without noticeably altering the thermodynamic properties of the atom-molecule mixture. That is, because the trapping frequencies, f trap , of both the molecular and atomic gases satisfy f trap < 0.4 kHz along all three principal axes of the trap, the chosen modulation frequency for the time-averaged potential does not notably affect the temperature or density of the atoms and molecules in the sample.",

It provides precise predictions for measurable quantities that can be tested experimentally. The probabilities, or branching fractions, of the strange B meson (B(s)(0)) and the B0 meson decaying into two oppositely charged muons (\u03bc+ and \u03bc\u2212) are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to theories that extend the standard model. The standard model predicts that the B(s)(0) \u2192\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 and B(0) \u2192\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 decays are very rare, with about four of the former occurring for every billion mesons produced, and one of the latter occurring for every ten billion B0 mesons. A difference in the observed branching fractions with respect to the predictions of the standard model would provide a direction in which the standard model should be extended. Before the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN started operating, no evidence for either decay mode had been found. Upper limits on the branching fractions were an order of magnitude above the standard model predictions. The CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) and LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaborations have performed a joint analysis of the data from proton\u2013proton collisions that they collected in 2011 at a centre-of-mass energy of seven teraelectronvolts and in 2012 at eight teraelectronvolts. Here we report the first observation of the B(s)(0) \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 decay, with a statistical significance exceeding six standard deviations, and the best measurement so far of its branching fraction. Furthermore, we obtained evidence for the B(0) \u2192 \u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 decay with a statistical significance of three standard deviations. Both measurements are statistically compatible with standard model predictions and allow stringent constraints to be placed on theories beyond the standard model. The LHC experiments will resume taking data in 2015, recording proton\u2013proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 teraelectronvolts, which will approximately double the production rates of B(s)(0) and B0 mesons and lead to further improvements in the precision of these crucial tests of the standard model.",

The root-mean-square charge radius, r(p), has been determined with an accuracy of 2 per cent (at best) by electron-proton scattering experiments. The present most accurate value of r(p) (with an uncertainty of 1 per cent) is given by the CODATA compilation of physical constants. This value is based mainly on precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen and calculations of bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED; refs 8, 9). The accuracy of r(p) as deduced from electron-proton scattering limits the testing of bound-state QED in atomic hydrogen as well as the determination of the Rydberg constant (currently the most accurately measured fundamental physical constant). An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of r(p) is provided by muonic hydrogen (a proton orbited by a negative muon); its much smaller Bohr radius compared to ordinary atomic hydrogen causes enhancement of effects related to the finite size of the proton. In particular, the Lamb shift (the energy difference between the 2S(1/2) and 2P(1/2) states) is affected by as much as 2 per cent. Here we use pulsed laser spectroscopy to measure a muonic Lamb shift of 49,881.88(76) GHz.

X-ray transition energies in muonic atoms are strongly affected by the size of the nuclei, and can be used efficiently to determine the nuclear charge distribution [1,2]. A detailed introduction about muonic atoms can be found in Ref. [3]. Moreover, the muonic atom tends to play an important role in investigation on other subjects. A recent study demonstrated that muonic atoms in strong laser fields can be used to dynamically gain structure information on nuclear ground states [4].

An attractive means to improve the accuracy in the measurement of proton root-mean square radius is provided by muonic hydrogen [6].

Initially nothing was found, but Rainwater suggested expanding the search beyond the energy range predicted by Wheeler on the basis of the then-accepted size of the radius of the atomic nucleus as around 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221215 m. When this was done, they found what they had been looking for, discovering in the process that the nucleus was closer to 1.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 m.

Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia.

Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected. Lactate increased in groups inhaling hypoxic air (poikilocapnic hypoxia: $0.0136\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009&lt;\u200910-6; isocapnic hypoxia: $0.0142\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}}{\\Delta{\\mathrm{S}}_{\\mathrm{a}}{\\mathrm{O}}_2}$, P\u2009=\u20090.003) but was unaffected by CO (P\u2009=\u20090.36). Lactate production was not associated with reduced CMRO2. These results point toward a mechanism of lactate production by upregulation of glycolysis mediated by sensing a reduced arterial oxygen pressure. The released lactate may act as a signaling molecule engaged in vasodilation.",

Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP.

Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest.

Maternal-fetal interaction has shown evolution during fetal maturation. In this work, we studied maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization in early and late gestation fetuses. We also evaluated variations in the synchronization due to congenital heart defect (CHD). Maternal-fetal heart rate synchronization for 22 early gestation (Age &lt; 32 weeks), $late gestation (Age &gt;32 weeks) and 7 CHD fetuses (5 of them with gestational age &lt; 32 weeks). The synchronization ratio between the mother and the fetus was more localized at certain fetus heart rate in the early gestation group while it was spreading over more fetal heart rate for the late group. For example, for maternal primary cycle of 3 beat- to-beat (m=3), the synchronization ratio of 5 fetus beats (n=5) contributed 60\u00b130% of the whole coupling ratios for the early group while it contributed 30\u00b030% for the late group (p&lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the coupling ratio of m:n=3:7 contributed 4\u00b117% of the early group and 13\u00b124% for the late group (p&lt; 0.05). The standard deviation of the phase coherence index $(\\lambda_{-\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D}})$ for both the late and the CHD groups were significantly higher than the early group at different values. For example, $\\lambda -\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{D} was 0.006\\pm 0.004$ for the early group while it was 0.009\u00b10.008 for the late group (p&lt; 0.01) and 0.01\u00b1 0.002 for the CHD group (p&lt; 0.01) for m=3. The variation between the early and late normal groups might indicate a healthy development of the autonomic nervous system while the higher variation in the CHD group could be a good marker for impairment of the cardiac autonomic activity. Further coupling analysis with more abnormal cases is needed to verify these findings.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg).

The measurement of the free-running VCO shows -107 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 kHz frequency offset. If locked to an external frequency reference the VCO shows 118 dBc/Hz phase noise at 300 KHz offset, while consuming 3 mA from a 1.2 V supply (3.6 mW). When the VCO is tuned during the locking, 20 dBm of reference power is required to enable operation in the whole MICS band. The measured phase noise of the free-running VCO ensures reliable calibration of the proposed transmitter and the locked VCO satisfies all requirements of an implantable device using MICS band data transmission.

The simplest physical models of diffraction use equations that describe the angular separation of light and dark fringes due to light of a particular wavelength (\u03bb).

A frame overlap mirror between the second pulse shaping and the wavelength band chopper hinders parasitic cross talk between pulses at wavelengths longer than 16 \u00c5. Two slits define the beam collimation and hence the angular resolution. The first slit about 4 m upstream the sample position is located behind the frame overlap mirror, while the second slit, defining the footprint of the beam on the sample, is located directly in front of the sample position (distances of a few cm can be set). A third slit behind the sample limits the neutron entrance window of the shielding mounted on the secondary reflectometer arm towards the area detector of 30 cm x 30 cm. The spatial resolution is approximately 2 mm and the maximum distance between sample and detector is 2 m. A very first slit right upstream of chopper 1 is used to limit the beam width to enable high wavelength resolution and to reduce background.

When a wave traverses a slit, its position is confined to the width s. This induces a transverse momentum uncertainty with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\n\u2206p = 0.89 h/s,(2)\nwhich evolves into a position uncertainty further downstream (see Appendix C). By measuring the beam's width, that is, its position uncertainty at the detector, we can thus extract \u2206p. 4,10 Within this envelope a multi-path interference pattern is formed when the wave is diffracted at two or more slits. Increasing the number N of illuminated slits sharpens the principal interference fringes and causes the occurrence of N \u22122 secondary maxima.

The electron micrographs of the respective masks are shown in the upper trace, and the molecular diffraction patterns are shown in the middle trace. They span molecular velocities v between 140 and 430 m/s, corresponding to de Broglie wavelengths \u03bb dB between 5.5 and 1.8 pm. Each bright dot corresponds to a single molecule that scatters thousands of fluorescence photons during detection. At first glance we observe a qualitative difference between the singleslit pattern and the other two: Diffraction at a single slit leads to a structureless, broad signal while the doubleand triple-slit pattern exhibit a sub-structure. This is what we expect based on Eq. (1) and Fig. 2.\n\nTo illustrate the level of detail in the patterns, we vertically sum over the velocity band between 140 and 150 m/s as shown in the lower trace of Fig. 4. Here all patterns share the same envelope resulting from single-slit diffraction. The triple slit pattern also reveals the expected secondary maximum in between the principal diffraction orders. Furthermore, the width of the zeroth diffraction order decreases with increasing N from 15.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m for the double slit to 12.0 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m for the triple slit.\n\nIt is often stated in textbooks that the wavelength has to be comparable to the grating period to observe interference. However, in the current experiments \u03bb dB is five orders of magnitude smaller than d, and still we observe high-contrast interference. To achieve this, we have to fulfill three conditions: First, the transverse coherence has to be large enough to engulf all slits that shall contribute to multi-slit interference.

The 0.25\u2009\u00d7\u200910 mm(2) slit was formed by two machined lead blocks. The LSF was obtained by laterally translating the detector in 0.25 mm steps underneath the slit over a range of 24 mm and taking a measurement at each step. This measurement was validated with Monte Carlo simulation using BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc. The presampling modulation transfer function (MTF), the Fourier transform of the line spread function, was determined and compared to calculated (Monte Carlo and analytical) MTFs. Two head-and-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields were measured using the device and were used to validate the LSF measurement. These fields were simulated with the BEAMnrc Monte Carlo model, and the Monte Carlo generated incident fluence was convolved with the 2D detector response function (derived from the measured LSF) to obtain calculated dose. The measured and calculated dose distributions were then quantitatively compared using \u03c7-comparison criteria of 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement for in-field points (defined as those above the 10% maximum dose threshold). The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the measured detector response for a single chamber is 4.3 mm, which is comparable to the chamber diameter of 3.8 mm. The pre-sampling MTF was calculated, and the resolution of one chamber was estimated as 0.25 lp\u2215mm from the first zero crossing. For both examined IMRT fields, the \u03c7-comparison between measured and calculated data show good agreement with 95.1% and 96.3% of in-field points below \u03c7 of 1.0 for fields 1 and 2, respectively (with an average \u03c7 of 0.29 for IMRT field 1 and 0.24 for IMRT field 2). The LSF for a new novel online detector has been measured at 6 MV using a narrow slit technique, and this measurement has been validated by Monte Carlo simulation. The detector response function derived from line spread function has been applied to recover measured IMRT fields.

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

The laser beam passes a narrow 785 nm maxline laser-line clean-up filter (Semrock, LL01-785) to ensure monochromatic excitation and an achromatic cylindrical lens (Thorlabs, f = 100 mm) that focuses the Gaussian beam into a line profile. The cylindrical lens sits on a rotational mount for adjusting the orientation of the line to ensure that it is properly imaged onto the entrance slit of the spectrometer (PI Acton, SpectraPro SP2300i). After the cylindrical lens, the line-profile is imaged by an achromatic lens (Thorlabs, f = 500 mm) onto the back aperture of a 60x, 1.2 N.A. water immersion objective lens (Olympus, UPlanSApo) and focused into the sample plane. The length of the line at the sample plane is 50 \u00b5m with a diffraction-limited width.

The system, called the PeriVib, is comprised of (1) a small, custom vibration motor designed to apply a vibration stimulus to the toe with constant pressure to test sensation threshold, and (2) a custom smart-phone app that enables a patient to run a series of functional gait and balance tests. Vibration is applied by PeriVib in two separate modes. The first mode, ramp-up, starts at zero amplitude and increases to a maximum level while the patient indicates when they start feeling the pressure by lifting their finger off the touch-screen on the phone. The second mode, ramp-down, starts at a maximal intensity and decreases in intensity; the patient indicates when they stop feeling the vibration. The smart-phone app determines the patient's threshold by recording the vibration amplitude when they indicate the onset or loss of vibratory sensation, depending on the mode. In both modes, the measurement is repeated five times. In addition to controlling the vibration motor during the vibration test, the smart phone app also enables collection of gait and sway metrics through the use of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors on the smartphone. The entire set of tests requires approximately 5 minutes to complete and can be done by a patient with minimal instructions from a clinician. In a cohort of 28 subjects with a history of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, we compared the PeriVib performance with two established threshold sensing systems: (1) a Biothesiometer device and (2) a tuning fork. We found that the sensation threshold estimated by PeriVib correlated well with the Biothesiometer ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.68) but less well with the tuning fork ($\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.15).

The fuller presentation allows us to show that even when Ca 2+ puffs do occur in the middle of the cell, they are invariably at the periphery, close to the PM. The new observations are discussed in the text (p9, middle), which we have re-organised to segregate the evidence that puffs occur near the PM from the evidence that even within the near-PM IP 3 Rs, only the immobile puncta respond (p9-10). Our conclusion that puffs occur predominantly near the basal PM concurs with a previous report, which is now cited 8 (p9, middle). We hope that the revised text (including Discussion, p14, middle) now more clearly makes the point that to be 'licensed' to respond, IP 3 Rs must be both near the PM and immobile. It is, therefore, a remarkably small subset of all IP 3 Rs that are 'licensed'.\n\nb.

A description of the uncertainties which arise from the fitting procedure are described in Section S4 of the Supplementary Information. Here we show that fitting simulated data with noise levels that are comparable to those in the experimental data returns the S-matrix amplitudes that were used to simulate the data within 10% ( Figure S7). As the probabilities presented in Table 1 are the square of these values, this leads to an approximate uncertainty of 20% in these values. We have made minor changes to the text to further emphasise that this information is given in the SI by rephrasing the following text on page 7.\n\nFurther details of the fitting procedure, the tests that were done to ensure the results correspond to a unique, converged S-matrix and the uncertainties related to this procedure can be found in the SI.\n\nIn addition, the calculated populations of different mJ states seem highly oscillating in Fig.  2c. This suggests that the measured S-matrix should be very sensitive to the length and field strength of B1. Could this be part of error?\n\nThe Reviewer is correct that any errors in the magnetic field profiles can introduce errors into the S-matrix elements that are obtained through the fitting procedure. However, as detailed in Section S4 of the Supplementary Information, fits have also been done where the length of the magnetic field profile and field strength of B1 have been changed to determine what effect this has on the S-matrix we obtain from the experimental data. We find that the Smatrix elements change by a few percent, but by less than our stated 10% uncertainty in the values.",

Our objective was to investigate associations between sub-daily exposures to PM and acute cardiac events using telemedicine data. We conducted a case-crossover study among telemedicine participants [Formula: see text] of age who called a service center for cardiac-related symptoms and were transferred to a hospital in Tel Aviv and Haifa, Israel (2002-2013). Ambient [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] measured by monitors located in each city during the hours before the patient called with symptoms were compared with matched control periods. We investigated the sensitivity of these associations to more accurate symptom onset time and greater certainty of diagnosis.

PM concentrations were associated with small increases in the odds of cardiac events.

At moderate negative substrate bias voltage (of V S = -0.61 V, cf. schematic drawing in Figure S5a and STM image in Figure 3e, Main Text), all molecule parts (i.e. the MSW backbone, the pillar unit carrying the perylene monoimide (PMI) unit, as well as the alkoxy side chains interdigitating intermolecularly on the HOPG substrate) are clearly visible. From this we conclude that the HOMOs of both MSW backbone and PMI/pillar units should be energetically located in the conduction region, contribute to the image contrast, and therefore might be visible by STM. The scenario should change at larger negative sample bias voltage V S , here defined as a voltage closer to zero (of V S = -0.50 V, cf. schematic drawing in Figure S5b and STM image in Figure 3f, Main Text): In this case, the HOMO of the 3D unit (i.e. PMI/pillar) may be energetically located outside (or, below) the conduction region. Consequently, the HOMO of the MSW backbone is the only orbital energetically located within the conduction region, so that only this molecule part renders visible (as seen in Figure 3e, Main Text). At small positive bias voltage (of V S = +0.50 V, cf. schematic drawing in Figure S5c and STM image in Figure 3g, Main Text), the 3D unit dominates the image contrast, as its HOMO is energetically located in the conduction region, while the HOMO of the MSW backbone is not, and is consequently invisible (or barely visible) in the STM image. The heights of 1 and 3 measured in the STM experiments are results of the topographic heights of the adsorbed species on the HOPG surface as well as their electronic properties translating into different electrical conductivities (or tunneling resistivities), which are also bias voltage dependent.

Time series data (movies) were imported into ImageJ as nd2 files (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) using the LOCI plugin. We used the line tool to draw a segmented line, three pixels wide, over the length of the microtubule. We used the macro \"measure stacks\" to measure the mean intensity of the line for each frame of the movie. The same line was moved to a location without microtubules to measure the mean background intensity near the microtubules. The intensity was normalized by dividing the intensity by the background (I measured /I BG ) to give the signal to noise ratio. In order to remove the background, we subtracted one (1 = I BG /I BG ).\n\nThis caused all the initial intensities to be one. The individual, normalized microtubule intensity data were then averaged together and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean over multiple measurements of different filaments. There is some variability in the measured fluorescence, as described in the main text. This is most likely due to the laser power fluctuating over time from experiment to experiment. As well as the fact that the normalization described above is performed for each microtubule separately, introducing some stochastic noise into the final average. The intensity fluctuations have the largest effect on the measurement of the final microtubule polymer fraction remaining found by fitting to Equation 1. Because of this, we have quoted the uncertainty of the fits from the data in the text but plotted the uncertainty in the measurement as 7% in Figure 1c.\n\nThe number of microtubules analyzed for each experimental parameter are given in the figure captions.

A magnifier's field of view often contains only a few letters at a time. Page navigation is the process by which the reader moves the magnifier from word to word, and from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line. Page navigation takes time and reduces reading speed. The major questions addressed in this paper are: (1) What role does page navigation play in limiting reading speed? and (2) Are the window width requirements for reading (number of characters in the field for a criterion performance level) increased by the need for page navigation? We measured the reading speeds of three normal-vision and seven low-vision subjects in two ways: with drifting-text requiring no page navigation, and with a closed-circuit TV (CCTV) magnifier which required page navigation. We built special hardware to record the location of the CCTV's magnified field in the text. These recordings were used to separate forward-reading time (left-to-right movement through the text) from retrace time (navigational movement). For normal-vision subjects, forward-reading and retrace times were about equal. For low-vision subjects, retrace times were shorter than forward-reading times, indicating that the forward-reading performance was limited by visual, not navigational, demands. The retrace time did have an impact, however, ranging from 17 to 50% of the overall time. The window requirements for reading with page navigation (CCTV) were larger than those for reading without page navigation (drifting-text). The difference was more than a factor of three for normal-vision subjects and close to a factor of two for low-vision subjects (10 characters for CCTV vs 5.2 characters for drifting-text for 85% of maximum reading speed.",

Those methods usually rely on sparse random, importance, or worst-case sampling. Inevitably, this imposes a trade-off between computational speed and accuracy of the uncertainty propagation. Here, we investigate analytical probabilistic modeling (APM) as an alternative for uncertainty propagation and minimization in IMPT that does not rely on scenario sampling. APM propagates probability distributions over range and setup uncertainties via a Gaussian pencil-beam approximation into moments of the probability distributions over the resulting dose in closed form. It supports arbitrary correlation models and allows for efficient incorporation of fractionation effects regarding random and systematic errors. We evaluate the trade-off between run-time and accuracy of APM uncertainty computations on three patient datasets. Results are compared against reference computations facilitating importance and random sampling. Two approximation techniques to accelerate uncertainty propagation and minimization based on probabilistic treatment plan optimization are presented. Runtimes are measured on CPU and GPU platforms, dosimetric accuracy is quantified in comparison to a sampling-based benchmark (5000 random samples). APM accurately propagates range and setup uncertainties into dose uncertainties at competitive run-times (GPU [Formula: see text] min). The resulting standard deviation (expectation value) of dose show average global [Formula: see text] pass rates between 94.2% and 99.9% (98.4% and 100.0%). All investigated importance sampling strategies provided less accuracy at higher run-times considering only a single fraction. Considering fractionation, APM uncertainty propagation and treatment plan optimization was proven to be possible at constant time complexity, while run-times of sampling-based computations are linear in the number of fractions. Using sum sampling within APM, uncertainty propagation can only be accelerated at the cost of reduced accuracy in variance calculations. For probabilistic plan optimization, we were able to approximate the necessary pre-computations within seconds, yielding treatment plans of similar quality as gained from exact uncertainty propagation. APM is suited to enhance the trade-off between speed and accuracy in uncertainty propagation and probabilistic treatment plan optimization, especially in the context of fractionation. This brings fully-fledged APM computations within reach of clinical application.",

I am not sure you can be as strong as saying U-U is invalidated.

But the fact that the uncertainty in the U-U coordination number (CN) is larger than the CN number indicates that the model can describe the data just as well without the U-U signal. The uncertainty in C2 is smaller than the CN number and thus indicates that this signal is required to have a model of this quality. So the data are clear.

Cold regions constitute an important ecological barrier in China; however, few studies focus on change in [Formula: see text] in cold regions. Especially in the cold region of northeast China (CRNEC), as one of the national strategic grain bases, understanding spatial-temporal variations of [Formula: see text] is important for agriculture water management and ecological protection.

Results indicate that annual [Formula: see text] increases from the northeast to the southwest of CRNEC and has an insignificant decreasing trend in the whole study period, in which 33 stations (29.2%) show significant decreasing trends and only 19 stations (16.8%) show significant increasing trends at the 95% confidence level. An abrupt change in [Formula: see text] data is detected from 1994. Reasons for this abrupt change in [Formula: see text] vary largely over the study areas. Analysis shows that wind speed and minimum air temperature are the two major factors that control the change of [Formula: see text] before 1994. It also shows that wind speed and actual vapor pressure are the two major controlling factors after 1994.

In performing these tests, we replaced all of the red horizontal branch (HB) stars with blue HB stars, while conserving the total V flux on the HB. We can find no \"extreme\" HB cases that give a more self consistent Fe I solution across all of the diagnostics than the one obtained with an intermediate age.

It is well-established that an important component of human conversation (whether in speech, text, or any medium) is the maintenance of common ground. Maintaining common ground has a number of associated processes in which conversational participants engage. Many of these processes are lacking in current synthetic teammates, and it is unknown to what extent this lack of capabilities affects their ability to contribute during team-based tasks. We focused our research on how teams <ipackage</i information within a conversation, by which we mean specifically (1) whether information is explicitly mentioned or implied, and (2) how multiple pieces of information are ordered both within single communications and across multiple communications. We re-analyzed data collected from a simulated remotely-piloted aerial system (RPAS) task in which team members had to specify speed, altitude, and radius restrictions. The data came from three experiments: the \"speech\" experiment, the \"text\" experiment, and the \"evaluation\" experiment (which had a condition that included a synthetic teammate). We asked first whether teams settled on a specific routine for communicating the speed, altitude, and radius restrictions, and whether this process was different if the teams communicated in speech compared to text. We then asked how receiving special communication instructions in the evaluation experiment impacted the way the human teammates package information. We found that teams communicating in either speech or text tended to use a particular order for mentioning the speed, altitude, and radius. Different teams also chose different orders from one another. The teams in the evaluation experiment, however, showed unnaturally little variability in their information ordering and were also more likely to explicitly mention all restrictions even when they did not apply. Teams in the speech and text experiments were more likely to leave unnecessary restrictions unmentioned, and were also more likely to convey the restrictions across multiple communications. The option to converge on different packaging routines may have contributed to improved performance in the text experiment compared some of the conditions in the evaluation experiment.",

Distance and near reading speeds of 20 presbyopes (ages 40-60 years) were measured while viewing through artificial pupils (diameters 1-4.5 mm), natural pupils, or with a multifocal contact lens. Space-averaged text luminance levels varied from 0.14 to 140 cd/m2 (including the range of measured environmental text luminances). Adding black text to a white computer display or paper reduces luminance by approximately 15% to 31%, and the lowest encountered environmental text luminance was approximately 2 to 3 cd/m2.

The 2- to 3-mm artificial pupils and the multifocal contact lenses both enabled maximum or near-maximum reading speeds for 0.5 logMAR characters at distance and near, but with natural pupils, reading speeds were significantly reduced at near. Although photon noise at low luminance reduces the visual benefits of small pupils, the benefits of 2- to 3-mm artificial pupils are sufficient to enable &gt;80% of distance-corrected presbyopes to read proficiently at near, even at the lowest text luminances found in interior environments.",

We present a prognostic model for functional decline in ALS where outcome uncertainty is taken into account. Patient data were reduced and projected onto a 2D space using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a novel non-linear dimension reduction technique. Information from 3756 patients was included. Development data were sourced from past clinical trials. Real-world population data were used as validation data. Predictors included age, gender, region of onset, symptom duration, weight at baseline, functional impairment, and estimated rate of functional loss. UMAP projection of patients showed an informative 2D data distribution. As limited data availability precluded complex model designs, the projection was divided into three zones defined by a functional impairment range probability. Zone membership allowed individual patient prediction. Patients belonging to the first zone had a probability of [Formula: see text] (\u00b1 [Formula: see text]) to have an ALSFRS score over 20 at 1-year follow-up.

The maximum intensity of the resonant state occurs at the same PE (within experimental uncertainty) as for the surface in UHV conditions. 3. The position of the resonantly enhanced above VBM feature shifts to higher BE values compared to its position in UHV. Together, these findings suggest that the resonant state arises from the same set of V 3d (localized) orbitals irrespective of whether the surface is pristine or exposed to water. A detailed analysis of the resonant state for the surface in 0.05 Torr H 2 O allows the disentangling of its two spectral components, separated by 0.4 eV (Figure 4b). The low BE component (BE = 1.5 eV) represents the resonant contribution from the reduced V 4+ generated by the localization of the excess charge from the Mo 6+ dopants or more generally non-hydroxylated VO 4 moieties, as previously assigned; 8 the higher BE component (BE = 1.9 eV) is related to the conversion of surface V 5+ to V 4+ upon the adsorption of water and likely the hydroxylation of the VO 4 moieties.

Both terminal conditions are treatable and potentially separable if discovered and aggressively managed. It is not the intent of this presentation to criticize the evaluation of this patient, but rather to point out the need and, also, the potential benefits of an alternate approach, which could have significantly changed the course of this particular patient's evaluation. We have conducted similar analyses with other CPC cases with almost equivalent specificity. These same evaluations have been performed in a real clinical setting with live patient data. What we have learned so far we think will be extremely helpful in extending the potential application of this technology: A text-based decision support tool is only as good as its practitioner. It takes practice and training to learn to use this system effectively. There are many traps in logic, and the use of words and terms within the text must be understood to effectively utilize this tool. There are shortcuts in logical analysis which we mentally use all the time but which cannot be accepted using this system (e.g., you must not rely on your memory or any specific associations to circumvent the system). The system will only become clinically relevant when the entire field of medicine is included in the data base. This is one of our current limitations with only two-thirds of the Merck medical text available for reference. This makes it difficult to apply to a general medical problem since we are not sure which direction the case might take, and often these are multisystem diseases or problems that put us at a severe disadvantage if we don't have the necessary data base. The structure and integrity of the data base are critical to the success of the system. Since numbers are ubiquitous, these cannot be used for key word elements. Techniques must be introduced to create word-oriented numbers that can be uniquely identified (e.g., \"AGE14-20\"). The publisher of the data must supply a continuous flow of up-to-date material that can be incorporated within the framework of the working system. It is possible to train medical technicians to use the system if they are familiar with medical terminology.

The effect of multiple proton-proton interactions is corrected for, and an uncertainty is evaluated using in situ techniques. The smallest JES uncertainty of less than 1\u00a0% is found in the central calorimeter region ([Formula: see text]) for jets with [Formula: see text]. For central jets at lower [Formula: see text], the uncertainty is about 3\u00a0%.

The calibration of forward jets is derived from dijet [Formula: see text] balance measurements. The resulting uncertainty reaches its largest value of 6\u00a0% for low-[Formula: see text] jets at [Formula: see text]. Additional JES uncertainties due to specific event topologies, such as close-by jets or selections of event samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks or gluons, are also discussed.

Overall, we ranked in the middle of the pack compared to other participants, but our fairly good agreement with experiment is still promising considering the challenge molecules are chemically diverse and often polyprotic while our training set is predominately monoprotic. Of particular importance to us when building this model was to include an uncertainty estimate based on the chemistry of the molecule that would reflect the likely accuracy of our prediction. Our model reports large uncertainties for the molecules that appear to have chemistry outside our domain of applicability, along with good agreement in quantile-quantile plots, indicating it can predict its own accuracy.

A better definition may be that thermal energy consists of a spectrum of thermal photons (thermal radiation) whose wavelengths are sufficiently long that they are readily absorbed by condensed matter plus any phonons that are associated with molecular vibrations (both inter and intra). Of course, a most rudimentary definition being that thermal energy is heat.\n\nHere on Earth, thermal energy primarily involves frequencies at, and/or close to the infrared spectrum with the emphasis on the \"thermal infrared\" [aka mid infrared: (3\u03bcm < \u03bb < 8\u03bcm)] and into the far infrared [aka long infrared (8\u03bcm < \u03bb < 15\u03bcm)].\n\nShorter wavelength photons, such as those in the near infrared (740nm < \u03bb < 3\u03bcm) and those considered as visible light (380nm < \u03bb < 740nm) can also contribute as thermal energy, e.g., when they are absorbed by matter. This absorbed energy becomes part of that matter's various vibrational energies. And this energy is generally, then reradiated as thermal photons, i.e., at a lower frequency (infrared) than the absorbed frequencies.\n\n\nVI.

Strangely, it is also association with radiation from both our Sun, and very hot molten metal, neither of which are crystalline.\n\nMoreover, both liquids and amorphous solids lack any crystalline structure, and yet it is accepted that the thermal energy resides. \"Is this not also blackbody?\"\n\nBased upon accepted theory one might argue that there is some profound difference between thermal energy and blackbody radiation beyond their associations with temperature. Yet when considering their heat capacities, all condensed matter fundamentally adheres to the same principles, e.g., the law of Dulong and Petit. It strikes this author as odd that crystalline solids thermally behave the same as amorphous solids, yet theoretically they are not theoretically considered the same it comes to their radiation.",

Often quoted as 33 K for Earth, GE is estimated as a difference between planet's observed mean surface temperature and an effective radiating temperature calculated from the globally averaged absorbed solar flux using the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) radiation law. This approach equates a planet's average temperature in the absence of greenhouse gases or atmosphere to an effective emission temperature assuming ATE\u2009\u2261\u2009GE. The SB law is also routinely employed to estimating the mean temperatures of airless bodies. We demonstrate that this formula as applied to spherical objects is mathematically incorrect owing to H\u00f6lder's inequality between integrals and leads to biased results such as a significant underestimation of Earth's ATE. We derive a new expression for the mean physical temperature of airless bodies based on an analytic integration of the SB law over a sphere that accounts for effects of regolith heat storage and cosmic background radiation on nighttime temperatures. Upon verifying our model against Moon surface temperature data provided by the NASA Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, we propose it as a new analytic standard for evaluating the thermal environment of airless bodies. Physical evidence is presented that Earth's ATE should be assessed against the temperature of an equivalent airless body such as the Moon rather than a hypothetical atmosphere devoid of greenhouse gases.

Earth is approximately , so its radiation peaks near 10,000 nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans. Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.",

The second kind involves the change in the vertical lapse rate of temperature, water vapor, and clouds in the troposphere and albedo of the Earth's surface. Using satellite observations of the annual variation of the outgoing flux of longwave radiation and that of reflected solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere, this study estimates the so-called \"gain factor,\" which characterizes the strength of radiative feedback of the second kind that operates on the annually varying, global-scale perturbation of temperature at the Earth's surface. The gain factor is computed not only for all sky but also for clear sky. The gain factor of so-called \"cloud radiative forcing\" is then computed as the difference between the two. The gain factors thus obtained are compared with those obtained from 35 models that were used for the fourth and fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment. Here, we show that the gain factors obtained from satellite observations of cloud radiative forcing are effective for identifying systematic biases of the feedback processes that control the sensitivity of simulated climate, providing useful information for validating and improving a climate model.",

Both instruments far exceeded their 6 year design life and continue to operate satisfactorily for more than 15 and 13 years, respectively. The MODIS instrument is designed to make observations at nearly a 100% duty cycle covering the entire Earth in less than 2 days. The MODIS sensor characteristics include a spectral coverage from 0.41 \u03bcm - 14.4 \u03bcm, of which those wavelengths ranging from 3.7 \u03bcm - 14. 4 \u03bcm cover the thermal infrared region which is interspaced in 16 Thermal Emissive Bands (TEB). Each of the TEB contains 10 detectors which record samples at a spatial resolution of 1 km. In order to ensure a high level of accuracy for the TEB measured Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) radiances, an onboard BlackBody (BB) is used as the calibration source. This paper reports the noise characterization and performance of the TEB on various counts. First, the stability of the onboard BB is evaluated to understand the effectiveness of the calibration source. Next, key noise metrics such as the Noise Equivalent Temperature difference (NEdT) and the Noise Equivalent dn difference (NEdN) for the various TEB are determined from multiple temperature sources. These sources include the nominally controlled BB temperature of 290 K for T-MODIS and 285 K for A-MODIS, as well as a BB Warm Up - Cool Down (WUCD) cycle that is performed over a temperature range from roughly 270 K - 315 K. The Space View (SV) port that measures the background signal serves as a viable cold temperature source for measuring noise. In addition, a well characterized Earth View (EV) Target, the Dome C site located in the Antarctic plateau, is used for characterizing the stability of the sensor, indirectly providing a measure of the NEdN. Based on this rigorous characterization, a list of the noisy and inoperable detectors for the TEB for both instruments is reported to provide the science user communities quality control of the MODIS Level 1B calibrated product.",

Based on empirical evidence, the limits for biological activity on Earth are: (1) the temperature range is from 253 to 394 K; (2) the salinity range is a(H2O) = 0.6-1.0; (3) the desiccation range is from 60% to 100% relative humidity; (4) the acidity range is from pH 0 to 13; (5) microbes such as Deinococcus are roughly 4,000 times more resistant to ionizing radiation than humans; (6) the range for hydrostatic pressure is from 0 to 1,100 bars; and (7) the maximum time for organisms to survive in the dormant state may be as long as 250 million years. The potential habitats for life on Europa are the ice layer, the brine ocean, and the seafloor environment. The dual stresses of lethal radiation and low temperatures on or near the icy surface of Europa preclude the possibility of biological activity anywhere near the surface. Only at the base of the ice layer could one expect to find the suitable temperatures and liquid water that are necessary for life. An ice layer turnover time of 10 million years is probably rapid enough for preserving in the surface ice layers dormant life forms originating from the ocean. Model simulations demonstrate that hypothetical oceans could exist on Europa that are too cold for biological activity (T &lt; 253 K). These simulations also demonstrate that salinities are high, which would restrict life to extreme halophiles. An acidic ocean (if present) could also potentially limit life. Pressure, per se, is unlikely to directly limit life on Europa. But indirectly, pressure plays an important role in controlling the chemical environments for life. Deep ocean basins such as the Mariana Trench are good analogues for the cold, high-pressure ocean of Europa. Many of the best terrestrial analogues for potential Europan habitats are in the Arctic and Antarctica.

Applying the Brillouin scattering into the Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) to obtain the in situ elastic wave velocities of minerals, is the important approach to investigate elastic properties of Earth's Interior.

We have also explored the effect of the stellar UV levels as well as spectral energy distribution on a terrestrial atmosphere, concentrating on detectable atmospheric features that indicate habitability on Earth, namely, H2O, O3, CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl. The increase in UV dominates changes of O3, OH, CH4, N2O, and CH3Cl, whereas the increase in stellar temperature dominates changes in H2O. The overall effect as stellar effective temperatures and corresponding UV increase is a lower surface temperature of the planet due to a bigger part of the stellar flux being reflected at short wavelengths, as well as increased photolysis. Earth-like atmosphere models show more O3 and OH but less stratospheric CH4, N2O, CH3Cl, and tropospheric H2O (but more stratospheric H2O) with increasing effective temperature of main sequence stars. The corresponding detectable spectral features, on the other hand, show different detectability depending on the wavelength observed.

INTRODUCTION\n\nTraditionally in thermodynamics the notion of thermal energy lacks the precision of clarity. One considers temperature (T) as the parameter that relates to the kinematic motions at the molecular level in most matter. This actually forms the basis of statistical thermodynamics, as can be found in most contemporary books [1,2]. Statistical arguments are based upon the kinematics of matter, hence the bizarre notion that all vacuums have no temperature, has become accepted. When measuring a system's temperature, a thermometer is placed into thermal contact with that system. Thermal equilibrium occurs once the influx of thermal energy equals the efflux between both the thermometer, and the system. This actually forms the basis of the transitive property known as the zeroth law of thermodynamics which states that \"If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they must be in thermal equilibrium with each other\" [1, pg 282]. Intuitively, the third system may be considered a thermometer.",

Derived scale heights plus other experimental and theoretical results indicate that molecular nitrogen is the predominant atmospheric constituent. The surface pressure and temperature appear to be about 1.6 bars and 93 K, respectively. The main clouds are probably methane ice, although some condensation of nitrogen cannot be ruled out. Solar abundance arguments suggest and the measurements allow large quantities of surface methane near its triple-point temperature, so that the three phases of methane could play roles in the atmosphere and on the surface of Titan similar to those of water on Earth. Radio occultation measurements of Saturn's atmosphere near 75 degrees south latitude reached a maximum pressure of 1.4 bars, where the temperature is about 156 K. The minimum temperature is about 91 K near the 60-millibar pressure level. The measured part of the polar ionosphere of Saturn has a peak electron concentration of 2.3 x 10(4) per cubic centimeter at an altitude of 2500 kilometers above the 1-bar level in the atmosphere, and a plasma scale height at the top of the ionosphere of 560 kilometers. Attenuation of monochromatic radiation at a wavelength of 3.6 centimeters propagating obliquely through Saturn's rings is consistent with traditional values for the normal optical depth of the rings, but the near-forward scattering of this radiation by the rings indicates effective scattering particles with larger than expected diameters of 10, 8, and 2 meters in the A ring, the outer Cassini division, and the C ring, respectively. Preliminary analysis of the radio tracking data yields new values for the masses of Rhea and Titan of 4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) and 236.64 +/- 0.08 x 10(-6) times the mass of Saturn. Corresponding values for the mean densities of these objects are 1.33 +/- 0.10 and about 1.89 grams per cubic centimeter.

Importantly, the thermal radiation existing in freespace is relevant to a proper understanding of thermodynamics. It is probably the case that the thermal energy from our Sun's insolation can be approximated by some linear function of temperature. Hence, our Sun's radiance may help us understand temperature's linear functionality, as witness here on Earth, with our atmosphere being the massive heat sink/bath to which most other systems are compared.\n\nClarity as to the exact meaning concerning thermal energy remains awkward. Accepting that it is the energy that results in molecular vibrations, then it is primarily in the thermal infrared and extends into the far infrared spectrum. Depending upon the matter in question, and it may also include certain frequencies in both the visible, and near infrared, as well as the microwave.\n\nHere on Earth's surface, we may reside in a unique position where a system's thermal energy density is linearly proportional to its temperature. Moreover, this linear functionality has a temperature range, i.e., it does not apply to either high temperature systems, e.g. blast furnaces, nor to low temperature systems, e.g. systems approaching absolute zero. The exactness of such limitations, have yet to be properly determined.\n\nThe implication of the new understandings presented herein will be fundamental in any new understanding of thermodynamics. It also means that there exists a need to create new realistic models for climate change, models that recognize that global warming is due to man's activities and have little to do with the so-called greenhouse gases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT I would like to thank Gail, and Lloyd Mayhew for their assistance in putting this paper together.\n\nFig. 2 .\n2Sketch for our Sun's spectral irradiance for visible light through to the far infrared X.

However, the amount emitted depends both on Earth's temperature and on its albedo: The more reflective the Earth in a certain wavelength, the less radiation it would both receive and emit in this wavelength; the warmer the Earth, the more radiation it emits.

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

Although the brightness of semiconductor lasers has been increased by the use of edge-emitting-type resonators, their brightness is still one order of magnitude smaller than that of gas and solid-state/fibre lasers, and they often suffer from large beam divergence with strong asymmetry and astigmatism. Here, we develop a so-called 'double-lattice photonic crystal', where we superimpose two photonic lattice groups separated by one-quarter wavelength in the x and y directions. Using this resonator, an output power of 10\u2009W with a very narrow-divergence-angle (&lt;0.3\u00b0) symmetric surface-emitted beam is achieved from a circular emission area of 500\u2009\u03bcm diameter under pulsed conditions, which corresponds to a brightness of over 300\u2009MW\u2009cm<sup-2</sup\u2009sr<sup-1</sup.

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

Within this wavelength range, the laser is able to penetrate the tissue up to a certain depth without causing thermal damage. By tight focusing of the laser radiation, intensities over 1 TW/cm2 (1 TW = 1012 watts) arise inside the laser focus. These extreme intensities induce nonlinear effects and optical breakdown occurs. This causes the disruption of the material, limited to the focal point. The process is known as photodisruption. Due to the ultra short pulse duration of only a few femtoseconds (1 fs = 10\u221215 seconds) there is only very low energy of a few nanojoules (1 nJ = 10\u22129 joules) per laser pulse deposits into the tissue.

The seed laser is frequency-locked on a Fabry-Perot cavity to narrow the linewidth and stabilize the frequency. Because the wavelength of the seed laser is located at the edge of the gain profile of the Ti:sapphire crystal, it is difficult to injection-lock the Ti:sapphire laser at 725 nm.

This method effectively reduces the power requirement of the seed laser at 725 nm, and the Ti:sapphire laser can be injection-locked at higher output power. As a result, a 1 W output power with a 27% slope efficiency is achieved in the injection-locked laser, and a 210 mW UV laser is obtained in a subsequent second-harmonic generation stage.

Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense. For example, when Ernst \u00d6pik estimated the density of some visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the Sun's, which was so high that he called it \"impossible\".",

Two identical humidifiers of each type (HC 602, HumiCare 200, Humid Aire 2i, minni-Max, MR 730 AGM, REMstar, Sirius, Somnia2, Somno Comfort2, VENTIclick, VIVO 30) were measured at three different heating intensities (low, medium, high) and three different flow rates (20, 55 and 90 l/min). The relative humidity at the exit of the tube and the temperature of the water in the heating chamber were registered. Additionally, we measured the humidity of the oxygen humidifier Respiflo at 1 - 5 l/min, the Respiflo was filled with either NaCl 0.9% or Aqua dest. Measurements were taken in a climatic chamber at 20 degrees C and 50% relative humidity. The atmospheric pressure was taken into consideration. The MR 730 AGM and Humicare 200 generated a constant relative humidity of 100%. Among the remaining humidifiers, only the HC 602, HumidAire 2i and REMstar reached a humidity of about 95% at high flow rates. The Minni-Max, Somnia2 and VIVO 30 generated a humidity of 95% still at a flow rate of 55 l/min. The Sirius, Somno Comfort2 and the VENTIclick generated this amount of humidity only at low flow rates of 20 l/min. The three humidifiers mentioned last generated a relative humidity of only 68 - 76 at high flow rates of 90 l/min. The Respiflo generates a humidity of about 90% at each flow rate (1 - 5 l/min.), independent of being filled with NaCl 0.9% or Aqua dest. Factors determinating the efficacy of humidifiers are the velocity of the airstream, the temperature of the water, the contact surface of the air and water compartments and the turbulence of the airstream. In vivo the amount of leakage is a very important determinant for the velocity of the airstream. In the care of mechanically ventilated patients one should have an approximate idea of the magnitude of the applied air flows. The limitations of some humidifiers should be known.

A single blackbody curve cannot properly reproduce the overall shape of the dust continuum, suggesting that there is some stratification in the dust layers. From our point of view, we can see through the outer (and colder) dust layers up the point where the dust becomes optically thick; at that point, the dust temperature is T max d . We thus approximated the dust emission by a weighted sum of blackbody spectra at temperatures between T max d and an arbitrarily chosen minimum temperature T min d of 25 K in steps of 25 K. Assuming optically thin dust in radiative equilibrium with the hottest (optically thick) dust, we then determined the appropriate weights for each temperature bin consistent with a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate (i.e. we determined the mass in each layer). We find that the best model is one with a maximum dust temperature of about 425 K (see Fig. 1). However, even in such a case, we overestimate the dust emission at the longer wavelengths; this suggests that there is less cold dust than expected for a constant-velocity outflow at a constant mass-loss rate. Nonetheless, the cold dust does not matter much for the analysis of the molecular bands; for the modeling presented in this paper, we assume that the molecules are absorbing 425 K blackbody radiation.\n\nWe also note that our dust temperature estimate is higher than that in Paper I, but our estimate should be more reliable than their greybody fit.\n\n\nMolecular bands\n\n\nMolecular Inventory\n\nSuperposed on the dust emission are many absorption features due to various molecular species (see Fig. 2).

As noted in \u00a74.2, the abundance reached with such a rate constant is not enough to explain the observed 556.936 GHz line. Since the rate constant for this reaction is not known and water abundance approximately scales with this rate, we have fitted R45 rate to get a 556.936 GHz line intensity in agreement with the observations. We find that it is necessary to increase the rate constant up to \u223c10 \u221215 cm 3 s \u22121 . The peak abundance obtained then is \u223c10 \u22127 as shown in Fig. 7 . With such an abundance profile, we have performed Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations. We show in Fig. 7 the lines predicted for ODIN in different scenarios in which the fluxes at \u03bb=3 and 6 \u00b5m vary. On the left side the central star has been considered as a blackbody at T =T * with and without dust throughout the CSE. We consider carbonaceous grains with sizes between 0.01 and 1 \u00b5m and a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 500 (Knapp 1985). It is seen that the presence of dust enhances the 557 GHZ line intensity since grains absorb the photons from the star (its maximum is at \u03bb=2 \u00b5m) and reemits at longer wavelengths, thus enhancing the flux at \u03bb=6\u00b5m and exciting the bending mode of H 2 O. In fact, the IR spectrum of IRC+10216 as observed by ISO (Cernicharo et al. 1999) peaks at 10 \u00b5m due to the presence of dust and approximately corresponds to a blackbody of radius 20 R * with a temperature of \u223c500 K. We can therefore simulate the IR flux that water in the outer envelope would receive by putting such a blackbody instead of the star. In Fig. 7 we see how the 556.936 GHz line intensity increases when the flux at \u03bb 6 \u00b5m is enhanced by considering a blackbody with increasing temperature. These radiative transfer models show the importance of the IR pumping of the excited vibrational levels of H 2 O for the intensities of pure rotational lines in the ground vibrational state.

SIRIUS [45] is a popular tool for identification that does not rely on spectrum prediction. It may be possible to combine MassFormer with SIRIUS (or another existing tool) to improve structure identifications. For example, SIRIUS uses information in the query spectrum to predict chemical features (such as precursor formulae and fingerprints) that help with identification. These features could be used refine a set of candidate compounds that would subsequently be ranked by predicted spectrum similarity with the query. Alternatively, forgoing a candidate database entirely, MassFormer could instead be combined with a generative model for small molecules to help search the chemical space for high-scoring spectrum matches, as seen in other works [52,53]. Finally, MassFormer has potential for use in decoy generation [54,55], which plays an important role in false discovery rate (FDR) calibration for untargeted metabolomics experiments. Target-decoy methods work by introducing a number of pseudo-random data points (realistic but synthetic spectra) that are ground truth negatives, allowing for empirical estimation and tuning of confidence thresholds to meet an FDR criterion. Applying MassFormer to predict noisy spectra for compounds that are unlikely to exist already in the sample (such as pesticide molecules in human blood) is a potentially powerful strategy for generating realistic decoys, which would improve FDR estimates and reduce the chance of incorrect compound identifications.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nProblem Formulation",

Namely, \"how does one now explain the reality that system's here on Earth radiate blackbody radiation whose thermal signature cannot be approximated as some linear function of temperature?\"\n\nTemperature is a comparative based upon the Zeroth law. Here on Earth, all comparisons are made to our atmosphere, whose temperature is strongly influenced by our Sun's insolation. Arguably, our atmosphere's temperature adheres to the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation.\n\nFurthermore, thermal equilibrium does not mean that two systems in thermal contact exchange precisely the same radiation spectrum. Rather that they exchange the same quantity of thermal energy. And here on Earth, as the biggest of all heat sinks/baths, our atmosphere will govern the relationships that define any exchanges of thermal energy.\n\nSo perhaps, the best explanation for thermal energy witnessed here on Earth generally being a linear function of temperature is as follows. \"Our atmosphere has its thermal energy density (ET/V) directly proportional to temperature (T). And since all our systems are ultimately compared to the comparatively massive atmosphere then they too can be contemplated in terms of, ET/V \u221d T.\"\n\n\nXI.

This is very similar to what happens when two isolated systems are coupled, like two hydrogen atomic orbitals coming together to form the bonding and antibonding orbitals of the hydrogen molecule, which are hybridized super-modes of the total coupled system.",

The excited state originates from the interaction between a photon and the quantum system. Photons carry energy that is determined by the wavelengths of the light that carries the photons. Objects that emit light with longer wavelengths, emit photons carrying less energy. In contrast to that, light with shorter wavelengths emit photons with more energy. When the photon interacts with a quantum system, it is therefore important to know what wavelength one is dealing with. A shorter wavelength will transfer more energy to the quantum system than longer wavelengths. On the atomic and molecular scale photoexcitation is the photoelectrochemical process of electron excitation by photon absorption, when the energy of the photon is too low to cause photoionization.

This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (\u0394E = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (\u0394E), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum.

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed on the 10-item CES-D to test four model fits: (a) unidimensional model, (b) two-factor correlated model, (c) three-factor correlated model, and (d) second-order factor model.

The method involved the exposure of the developed thin-layer chromatography plate of ledipasvir to strong ultraviolet irradiation, resulting in a great enhancement in the fluorescence properties of ledipasvir. The irradiated plates were scanned after the excitation at 315\u00a0$\\mathrm{nm}$. The method provided a sufficient separation of ledipasvir from sofosbuvir with ${R}_F$values of 0.28 and 0.36 for ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, respectively. The developed procedures were validated based on guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization and Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 5-50\u00a0$\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{band}$. The excellent analytical features of the proposed method allow to the specific determination of ledipasvir in pharmaceutical tablets without interference from sofosbuvir or excipients. As the main elimination route for ledipasvir is via the fecal excretion (86%), the method was applied for the estimation of ledipasvir in fecal specimens with adequate recovery. In addition, the proposed method was applied for testing the content uniformity of ledipasvir in the pharmaceutical tablets.",

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles. As the FEV(1) quartile worsened (mean, 62%, 49%, 39%, and 27% predicted), functional residual capacity increased (144%, 151%, 164%, and 185% predicted), IC decreased (86%, 81%, 69%, and 60% predicted), and peak incremental cycle work rate decreased (66%, 55%, 50%, and 44% predicted); CWR endurance time was 9.7, 9.3, 8.2, and 7.3 min, respectively. During CWR exercise, as FEV(1) quartile worsened, peak minute ventilation ($$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e) and tidal volume (Vt) decreased, whereas an inflection or plateau of the Vt response occurred at a progressively lower $$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e (P &lt; .0005), similar percentage of peak $$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e (82%-86%), and similar Vt/IC ratio (73%-77%). Dyspnea intensity at this inflection point was also similar across quartiles (3.1-3.7 Borg units) but accelerated steeply to intolerable levels thereafter. Progressive reduction of the resting IC with increasing disease severity was associated with the appearance of critical constraints on Vt expansion and a sharp increase in dyspnea to intolerable levels at a progressively lower ventilation during exercise.",

Structural plasticity is rarely accounted for in computational network models due to a lack of insight into the underlying neuronal mechanisms and processes. Little is known about how the rewiring of networks is dynamically regulated. To inform such models, we characterized the time course of neural activity, the expression of synaptic proteins, and neural morphology employing an in vivo optogenetic mouse model. We stimulated pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice and harvested their brains at 1.5 h, 24 h, and $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$ after stimulation. Stimulus-induced cortical hyperactivity persisted up to 1.5 h and decayed to baseline after $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ indicated by c-Fos expression. The synaptic proteins VGLUT1 and PSD-95, in contrast, were upregulated at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and downregulated at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$, respectively. Spine density and spine head volume were also increased at $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and decreased at $48\\,\\mathrm{h}$. This specific sequence of events reflects a continuous joint evolution of activity and connectivity that is characteristic of the model of homeostatic structural plasticity. Our computer simulations thus corroborate the observed empirical evidence from our animal experiments.",

The force sensor is implemented with a thin flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) encapsulated by a force sensitive medium, multilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The parasitic capacitance $( \\mathrm {C}_{P})$ inherent in long catheters significantly degrades the sensing accuracy of capacitive force sensors.

In striatum of PD monkey, two types of neurons were detected with mean amplitude of $102 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ and $296 \\mu \\mathrm{V}$ respectively; the mean firing rate was 62 Hz significantly higher than that in normal monkey; as for one representative type of neurons, with respect to local field potential oscillating at a period in cortex, local field potential continuously oscillated in striatum at low frequency at the range of 4-7Hz which was constituent with neuronal burst firing rate, while single neuron discharged at the range of 10-32Hz, almost at beta frequencies. Abnormal neural information detection by microelectrode arrays with ifferent signals in different position will play an important role in target location in brain of PD patients, especially for treatment.",

To facilitate the rapid and accurate quantification of low-energy electrons (0.1-10\u00a0keV) in liquid water at different site diameters (1-2000\u00a0nm), this study obtained ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$data for low-energy electrons under these conditions. This paper proposes a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA) to construct a prediction model and evaluate the corresponding prediction effect. The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$. The relative error range between the prediction results of the validated model and the Monte Carlo calculation results is 0.03-5.98% (the error range for single-energy electrons is 0.1-5.98%, and that for spectral distribution electrons is 0.03-4.4%).",

However, the effect of VR on blood pressure (BP) and autonomic function in healthy populations have not been explored. This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery. Results showed that under resting conditions, VE had no significant effect on BP or HRV when compared to seated rest and the VE video on a 2D screen. Following serial sevens, VE maintained the increased low frequency (LF) power of HRV $( 66 \\pm 4$ normalized units (n.u.)) compared to seated rest $( 55 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.0060)$; VE maintained the decreased high frequency (HF) power of HRV $( 34 \\pm 4\\mathrm {n}$.u.) compared to seated rest $( 44 \\pm 5\\mathrm {n}$.u., $\\mathrm {p}=0.014)$; and VE maintained the increased LF/HF ratio $( 2.4 \\pm 0.5)$ compared to seated rest $( 1.6 \\pm 0.3$, $\\mathrm {p}=0.012)$. Hence, after mental stress, VE sustains the increased sympathetic drive and reduced parasympathetic drive. VE may act as a stimulatory driver for autonomic activity and BP. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of different types of VE on BP and autonomic function.",

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives.

By removing the 348pF (91.5%) of $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$with the $\\mathrm {C}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ canceller, the capacitive force sensor achieves a capacitance resolution of 16aF equivalent to a force error of 0.5gf, which is a $10 \\times $ improvement compared to the conventional sensor interface. The proposed force sensor offers great potential for real-time force monitoring of cardiovascular surgery.",

Recent studies have shown that sensitized A-fibers maybe involved in the relay of pain information. These nerve fibers also carry sensory-induced action potentials (APs), such as proprioception, mechanoreception, etc. Electrical stimulation of these nerve fibers can result in interactions between sensory-induced APs and stimulation-induced APs. For example, the sensory-induced APs can collide with stimulus APs, and thus may never be relayed to the brain. In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of stimulation frequency on these interactions. Specifically, we focused on the goal of stimulation to simultaneously (i) block noxious sensory signals while (ii) relaying innocuous sensory signals from the periphery to the brain via a myelinated nerve fiber. We defined a performance metric called the \"selective relay $(SR)$ \" measure. Specifically, we constructed a tractable model of a nerve fiber that receives two inputs: the underlying sensory activity at the bottom of the fiber (noxious or innocuous), and the external stimulus applied to the middle of the fiber. We then defined relay reliability, $R$, as the percentage of sensory APs that make it to the top of the fiber. $SR$ is then a product of relaying innocuous sensory information while blocking noxious pain stimuli, i.e., $SR=R_{\\mathrm {s}\\mathrm {e}\\mathrm {n}}(1-R_{\\mathrm {p}\\mathrm {a}\\mathrm {i}\\mathrm {n}})$. We applied the two inputs to the fiber at various frequencies and analyzed relay reliability and then we studied selective relay assuming noxious and innocuous stimuli produce APs with distinct frequencies. We found that frequency stimulation between 50-100Hz effectively blocks relay of low-frequency pain signals, allowing mid-to-high frequency sensory signals to transmit to the brain.",

We searched for the mechanism of this lactate production by testing the hypothesis of upregulation of cerebral glycolysis mediated by hypoxic sensing. Describing the pathways counteracting brain hypoxia could help us understand brain diseases associated with hypoxia. A total of 65 subjects participated in this study: 30 subjects were exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia, 14 were exposed to isocapnic hypoxia, and 21 were exposed to carbon monoxide (CO). Using this setup, we examined whether lactate production reacts to an overall reduction in arterial oxygen concentration or solely to reduced arterial oxygen partial pressure. We measured cerebral blood flow (CBF), CMRO2, and lactate concentrations by magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. CBF increased (P\u2009&lt;\u200910-4), whereas the CMRO2 remained unaffected (P\u2009&gt;\u20090.076) in all groups, as expected.

The results show that the ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{F}}$ and ${\\overline{y}}_{\\mathrm{D}}$ values predicted by the MEA-BP neural network algorithm reach a training precision on the order of ${10}^{-8}$.

Recorded Iocalised, or even whole-body, tissue impedances often evidence high frequency artefacts which resemble additional capacitive or inductive behaviours. We show that making two impedance measurements with the same four electrodes, but by connecting them in different arrangements, we can cause either the observed high-frequency capacitive behaviour or the inductive behaviour. Additionally, simply calculating the mean of these two distorted data sets leads to a corrected, \"artefact-free\" impedance close to that expected. This correction method was validated on R-C networks (simulated as well as measured) and on biological tissue measurements (healthy forearm and oedematous leg). The described method was found valid using an SFB7 Impedimedo over a frequency range of 3 to $1000~\\mathrm {k}\\mathrm {H}\\mathrm {z}$.

This study quantifies the effect of instructed meditation augmented by a virtual environment (VE) on BP and heart rate variability (HRV) during rest and following physical (isometric handgrip) or mental (serial sevens subtraction) stress. Sixteen healthy participants underwent all conditions, and those that responded to the stress tests were included in the analysis of stress recovery.

Our experimental motion analysis and count of motile magnetotactic bacteria indicate that they migrate towards less-oxygenated regions within the vicinity of cancer cells. Bands of magnetotactic bacteria with average concentration of 18.8\u00b12.0% are observed in close proximity to MCF-7 cells $(h = 20~ \\mu \\mathrm {m})$, whereas the concentration at proximity of $190~ \\mu \\mathrm {m}$ is 5.0 \u00b1 6.8%.",

If this is the case, we should describe the relationship among proportions of face components quantitatively. This study aims to develop a mathematical model of facial proportions to provide a quantitative description of facial attractiveness. Furthermore, we expect that plastic surgeons can use models in clinical work to enhance communication efficiency between doctors and patients. Face alignment technique was used to analyse 5500 frontal faces with diverse properties (male/female, Asian/Caucasian, ages) to obtain the ratios among the nose length ($ {N}_{L} $), the nasal base width ($ N $), and the inner canthus width ($ {E}_{I} $). A mathematical model ($ {N}_{L}^{2} = a{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L}+b{E}_{I}\\mathrm{*}N+cN\\mathrm{*}{N}_{L} $) was developed to describe the relationship among these proportions. To validate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated the post-operative photos using Adobe Photoshop. Our findings show that the ratio of nose length to nose width, the ratio of inner canthus width to nose length and the ratio of inner canthus to nose width play a significant role in determining facial attractiveness. These results provide a possible strategy to quantitatively describe the relationship among human face proportions.",

Analysis was conducted on data from two previously published replicate clinical trials in 427 hyperinflated patients with COPD. Patients were divided into disease severity quartiles based on FEV(1) % predicted. Spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, and physiologic and perceptual responses to constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise at 75% of the peak incremental work rate were compared. Age, body size, and COPD duration were similar across quartiles. As the FEV(1) quartile worsened (mean, 62%, 49%, 39%, and 27% predicted), functional residual capacity increased (144%, 151%, 164%, and 185% predicted), IC decreased (86%, 81%, 69%, and 60% predicted), and peak incremental cycle work rate decreased (66%, 55%, 50%, and 44% predicted); CWR endurance time was 9.7, 9.3, 8.2, and 7.3 min, respectively. During CWR exercise, as FEV(1) quartile worsened, peak minute ventilation ($$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e) and tidal volume (Vt) decreased, whereas an inflection or plateau of the Vt response occurred at a progressively lower $$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e (P &lt; .0005), similar percentage of peak $$\\dot{\\mathrm{V}}$$e (82%-86%), and similar Vt/IC ratio (73%-77%). Dyspnea intensity at this inflection point was also similar across quartiles (3.1-3.7 Borg units) but accelerated steeply to intolerable levels thereafter. Progressive reduction of the resting IC with increasing disease severity was associated with the appearance of critical constraints on Vt expansion and a sharp increase in dyspnea to intolerable levels at a progressively lower ventilation during exercise.",

The proposed system employs a single-element ultrasound transducer and associated custom technology to record arterial diameter and wall thickness waveforms in real-time. Simultaneously acquired blood pressure, diameter and wall thickness parameters were used to evaluate diastolic local PWV (CD) and systolic local PWV (Cs) from an arterial site of interest. The developed prototype system was validated on a cohort of 15 subjects (age $=43\\pm 12$ years) that includes normotensives and hypertensives.

A significant difference between carotid Cs and CD $(\\Delta \\mathrm{C})$ was observed in all recruited subjects (group average $\\Delta \\mathrm{C} = 0.92\\pm 0.76\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s})$, illustrating the arterial pressure dependency of local PWV.

Normotensive versus hypertensive group-wise analysis was performed to investigate the degree of variation in the carotid local PWV over a cardiac cycle among different BP categories.

However, there is no objective assessment method to accurately characterize the severity of keloids. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perfusion levels of keloids and the expression levels of various internal cytokines, including hypoxia-induced factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), HT<sub2A</sub receptor subtype (5-HT<sub2A</sub R), and H1R, in keloids and nonadjacent normal skin and to propose a laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)-based relative perfusion index (RPI), through which keloids can be divided into five grades to objectively characterize their severity. This population-based cross-sectional study included 70 untreated keloid patients who each had only one keloid on the chest.

The Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain and pruritus were also used to assess each keloid.

We compared the perfusion and expression levels of intrinsic cytokines between keloids and normal skin. We established the RPI to grade the severity of keloids and applied different methods to test the utility of the RPI. The mean perfusion level of keloids was significantly higher than that of normal skin (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001). The expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGF, IL-17, 5-HT<sub2A</sub R, and H1R in keloids were significantly higher than those in normal skin (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).

Applications of two beam dynamical theory of electron diffraction considering absorption effect of electrons made clear the importance of relativistic effect of the mass of electron to the variation of extinction distance and transmissive power at higher voltage and noted that they are proportional to (v/c) and (v/c)2 respectively, where v and c are the velocity of illuminating electrons and light. With elevating accelerating voltage of illuminating electrons, it was noted that many diffracted waves are excited and thus, for understanding of the image contrast and the improvement of transmissive power of electrons, many beam dynamical theory considering absorption of electron waves has to be applied. Detailed analysis of the excitation and absorption of component Bloch waves was carried out and flux (electron current) flow of Bloch waves and total waves was deduced. Improvements of image contrast and visibility of the imperfection in crystalline materials both in thin and thick regions of ultra-high voltages were realized by using the multi-beam imaging (MBI) method. In MBI of very thick crystals, it was noted that most of the inelastically scattered electrons which appeared in the background of the diffraction patterns contribute to the image contrast by the successive elastic scattering after inelastic scattering. It was noted that the improvement of maximum usable thickness at high voltage is highly dependent on the contribution of inelastically scattered electrons. The calculated flux flows of total electrons of various materials in various orientations were calculated for not only ultra-high voltages but low voltages such as 100 kV. It was suggested that the intensity distribution of such flux flow will be recorded by the ultra HREM in the near future and will become useful to identify types of atoms, such as the interface consisting of different kinds of atoms.",

Since the ionization cross section depends on the chemical nature of the sample and the energy of ionizing electrons a standard value of 70 eV is used. At low energies (around 20 eV), the interactions between the electrons and the analyte molecules do not transfer enough energy to cause ionization. At around 70 eV, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons matches the length of typical bonds in organic molecules (about 0.14 nm) and energy transfer to organic analyte molecules is maximized, leading to the strongest possible ionization and fragmentation. Under these conditions, about 1 in 1000 analyte molecules in the source are ionized. At higher energies, the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons becomes smaller than the bond lengths in typical analytes; the molecules then become \"transparent\" to the electrons and ionization efficiency decreases.

The kinetic energies of the particles are much larger than the energies of particles at ambient temperature. The high energy and directionality of charged particle beams make them useful for many applications in particle physics (see Particle Beam Usage and Electron beam technology). Such beams can be split into two main classes: unbunched beams (coasting beams or DC beams), which have no longitudinal substructure in the direction of beam motion. bunched beams, in which the particles are distributed into pulses (bunches) of particles. Bunched beams are most common in modern facilities, since the most modern particle accelerators require bunched beams for acceleration.",

This phenomenon has been observed frequently in transmission electron microscopy. However, this is a very inefficient process, due to the inefficient transfer of momentum from the electron beam to the material. As a result, it is a slow process, requiring much longer exposure times than conventional electron beam lithography. Also high energy beams always bring up the concern of substrate damage. Interference lithography using electron beams is another possible path for patterning arrays with nanometer-scale periods. A key advantage of using electrons over photons in interferometry is the much shorter wavelength for the same energy. Despite the various intricacies and subtleties of electron beam lithography at different energies, it remains the most practical way to concentrate the most energy into the smallest area.",

For example, if each electron in the tube is accelerated through 60 kV, then it will acquire a kinetic energy of 60 keV, and when it strikes the target it can create X-ray photons with energy of at most 60 keV, by conservation of energy. (This upper limit corresponds to the electron coming to a stop by emitting just one X-ray photon. Usually the electron emits many photons, and each has an energy less than 60 keV.) A photon with energy of 60 keV or less has a wavelength of 21 pm or more, so the X-ray spectrum has exactly that cutoff, as seen in the graph. This cutoff applies to both the continuous (bremsstrahlung) spectrum and the characteristic sharp peaks: There is no X-ray of any kind beyond the cutoff.
