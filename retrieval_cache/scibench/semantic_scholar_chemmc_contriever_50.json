All of them 1) are proportional to the nuclear spin I and 2) have strong singularity. The similar nature of these operators leads to a suggestion that the calculations depend very little on their specific form. It allows us to expect that the relative contributions of different many-body parts of calculations will remain approximately the same for all operators. As we will show below this suggestion is fully justified.\n\n\nA. Electron-nucleon P,T-odd interactions",

INTRODUCTION\n\nResearch on nuclear symmetry energy has attracted much attention both theoretically and experimentally because of its importance in nuclear physics and astrophysics (for recent reviews, see Refs. [1][2][3]). Among the various methods, the yield of light particles and heavy fragments (or ratios of these particles and fragments), are frequently used to study the symmetry energy of nuclear matter from sub-saturation to supra-saturation densities produced in heavy-ion collisions (HICs) [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17]. The results obtained from these methods constrain the nuclear symmetry energy in a relative large scope [18]. As the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy is still an open problem, an international collaboration called the \"Symmetry Energy Project\" has been launched in order to determine the density dependence of the symmetry energy beyond the normal nuclear matter based on the newly built radioactive ion beam facilities [19]. At the same time, it is also hoped that new new observable for studying the nuclear symmetry energy will be found.",

All empirical data concerning wavenumbers and rovibronic term values of D 2 obtained by means of emission, absorption, Raman and anticrossing spectroscopy were collected, analyzed and reported in [9]. Since that time very few new experimental data about triplet rovibronic transitions of D 2 were obtained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) [17], IR tunable laser [18], and emission [19,20] spectroscopy.

All of them 1) are proportional to the nuclear spin I and 2) have strong singularity. The similar nature of these operators leads to a suggestion that the calculations depend very little on their specific form. It allows us to expect that the relative contributions of different many-body parts of calculations will remain approximately the same for all operators. As we will show below this suggestion is fully justified.\n\n\nA. Electron-nucleon P,T-odd interactions",

More details can be found on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server https://www.cryst.ehu.es/. We see that degeneracies occur at the Γ point and A, and the rest of the bands are split. We now build a short ranged tight-binding model from these orbitals. We will primarily discuss the para-magnetic (spin-unpolarized) DFT results which provide a single-particle band structure. Including Coulomb repulsion favors a ferromagnetic groundstate which is expected due to the flat bands obtained in the tight-binding models.",
