X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining waves' maxima are separated (see Figure 10.63).\n\n\nConstructive interface\n(a)\n\n\nDestructive interface\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 10.63 Light waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima.\n\nWhen X-rays of a certain wavelength, $\\lambda$, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, $d$, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, $n$, of the wavelength. This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, $\\theta$, is related to the wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:\n\n$$\nn \\lambda=2 d \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nThis relation is known as the Bragg equation in honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. Figure 10.64 illustrates two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive interference.",

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Since these wavelengths are comparable to the spaces between atoms in a crystalline solid, X-rays are scattered when they pass through crystals. The scattered rays undergo constructive and destructive interference that creates a specific diffraction pattern that may be measured and used to precisely determine the positions of atoms within the crystal. This phenomenon of X-ray diffraction is the basis for very powerful techniques enabling the determination of molecular structure. One of the pioneers who applied this powerful technology to important biochemical substances was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.\n\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910 to British parents, Dorothy's fascination with chemistry was fostered early in her life. At age 11 she was enrolled in a prestigious English grammar school where she was one of just two girls allowed to study chemistry. On her 16th birthday, her mother, Molly, gifted her a book on X-ray crystallography, which had a profound impact on the trajectory of her career. She studied chemistry at Oxford University, graduating with first-class honors in 1932 and directly entering Cambridge University to pursue a doctoral degree. At Cambridge, Dorothy recognized the promise of X-ray crystallography for protein structure determinations, conducting research that earned her a PhD in 1937. Over the course of a very productive career, Dr. Hodgkin was credited with determining structures for several important biomolecules, including cholesterol iodide, penicillin, and vitamin B12. In recognition of her achievements in the use of X-ray techniques to elucidate the structures of biochemical substances, she was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1969, she led a team of scientists who deduced the structure of insulin, facilitating the mass production of this hormone and greatly advancing the treatment of diabetic patients worldwide. Dr. Hodgkin continued working with the international scientific community, earning numerous distinctions and awards prior to her death in 1993.",

This radiation can affect living organisms. Ionizing radiation is the most harmful because it can ionize molecules or break chemical bonds, which damages the molecule and causes malfunctions in cell processes. It can also create reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage biological molecules and disrupt physiological processes. Radiation can cause somatic or genetic damage, and is most harmful to\nrapidly reproducing cells. Types of radiation differ in their ability to penetrate material and damage tissue, with alpha particles the least penetrating but potentially most damaging and gamma rays the most penetrating.\n\nVarious devices, including Geiger counters, scintillators, and dosimeters, are used to detect and measure radiation, and monitor radiation exposure. We use several units to measure radiation: becquerels or curies for rates of radioactive decay; gray or rads for energy absorbed; and rems or sieverts for biological effects of radiation. Exposure to radiation can cause a wide range of health effects, from minor to severe, and including death.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Ionizing radiation, however, may cause much more severe damage by breaking bonds or removing electrons in biological molecules, disrupting their structure and function.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

This is why patients undergoing radiation therapy often feel nauseous or sick to their stomach, lose hair, have bone aches, and so on, and why particular care must be taken when undergoing radiation therapy during pregnancy.\n\nDifferent types of radiation have differing abilities to pass through material (Figure 20.33). A very thin barrier, such as a sheet or two of paper, or the top layer of skin cells, usually stops alpha particles. Because of this, alpha particle sources are usually not dangerous if outside the body, but are quite hazardous if ingested or inhaled (see the Chemistry in Everyday Life feature on Radon Exposure). Beta particles will pass through a hand, or a thin layer of material like paper or wood, but are stopped by a thin layer of metal. Gamma radiation is very penetrating and can pass through a thick layer of most materials. Some high-energy gamma radiation is able to pass through a few feet of concrete. Certain dense, high atomic number elements (such as lead) can effectively attenuate gamma radiation with thinner material and are used for shielding.

Effect of a Change in Concentration - \nIn this case, the change in volume results in a reaction quotient greater than the equilibrium constant, and so the equilibrium will shift left.\n\nThese results illustrate the relationship between the stoichiometry of a gas-phase equilibrium and the effect of a volume-induced pressure (concentration) change. If the total molar amounts of reactants and products are equal, as in the first example, a change in volume does not shift the equilibrium. If the molar amounts of reactants and products are different, a change in volume will shift the equilibrium in a direction that better \"accommodates\" the volume change. In the second example, two moles of reactant $\\left(\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$ yield three moles of product ( $2 \\mathrm{NO}+\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ), and so decreasing the system volume causes the equilibrium to shift left since the reverse reaction produces less gas ( 2 mol ) than the forward reaction ( 3 mol ).

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.\n\nThis type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess's law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps. Hess's law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

It also has the highest vapor pressure. Due to its smaller size, ethanol exhibits weaker dispersion forces than diethyl ether. However, ethanol is capable of hydrogen bonding and, therefore, exhibits stronger overall IMFs, which means that fewer molecules escape from the liquid at any given temperature, and so ethanol has a lower vapor pressure than diethyl ether. Water is much smaller than either of the previous substances and exhibits weaker dispersion forces, but its extensive hydrogen bonding provides stronger intermolecular attractions, fewer molecules escaping the liquid, and a lower vapor pressure than for either diethyl ether or ethanol. Ethylene glycol has two -OH groups, so, like water, it exhibits extensive hydrogen bonding. It is much larger than water and thus experiences larger London forces.

Solutions - \nSolutions have previously been defined as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been implemented in many forms of manmade technology. A more thorough treatment of solution properties is provided in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but provided here is an introduction to some of the basic properties of solutions.\n\nThe relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration. Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component is called the solvent and may be viewed as the medium in which the other components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the solvent is called an aqueous solution.\n\nA solute is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with qualitative terms such as dilute (of relatively low concentration) and concentrated (of relatively high concentration).\n\nConcentrations may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of measurement units, each convenient for particular applications.

Solutions of Liquids in Liquids - \nSome liquids may be mixed in any proportions to yield solutions; in other words, they have infinite mutual solubility and are said to be miscible. Ethanol, sulfuric acid, and ethylene glycol (popular for use as antifreeze, pictured in Figure 11.13) are examples of liquids that are completely miscible with water. Two-cycle motor oil is miscible with gasoline, mixtures of which are used as lubricating fuels for various types of outdoor power equipment (chainsaws, leaf blowers, and so on).\n\n\nFIGURE 11.13 Water and antifreeze are miscible; mixtures of the two are homogeneous in all proportions. (credit: \"dno1967\"/Wikimedia commons)\n\nMiscible liquids are typically those with very similar polarities. Consider, for example, liquids that are polar or capable of hydrogen bonding. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solventsolvent, and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration of the chemical axiom \"like dissolves like.\"\n\nTwo liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible. Separate layers are formed when immiscible liquids are poured into the same container. Gasoline, oil (Figure 11.14), benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. Relatively weak attractive forces between the polar water molecules and the nonpolar liquid molecules are not adequate to overcome much stronger hydrogen bonding between water molecules. The distinction between immiscibility and miscibility is really one of extent, so that miscible liquids are of infinite mutual solubility, while liquids said to be immiscible are of very low (though not zero) mutual solubility.",

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry's law.",

Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware).

Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\n\nThe properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of $1+$. Their\nreactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal $\\left(0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right)$.\n\nThe alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is:\n\n\nFIGURE 18.3 Lithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil.\nAlkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds containing $1+$ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture and oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure 18.4 , to prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to their high reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal compounds.",

A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly\nobserved. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of $374^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm , and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases.

The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. The electrostatic attraction between the partially positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partially negative atom in another molecule gives rise to a strong dipole-dipole interaction called a hydrogen bond (e.g., HF...HF ).\n5.

Vapor Pressure Lowering - \nAs described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure exerted by its gaseous phase when vaporization and condensation are occurring at equal rates:\n\n$$\n\\text { liquid } \\rightleftharpoons \\text { gas }\n$$\n\nDissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in a lowering of the liquid's vapor pressure. This phenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect of added solute molecules on the liquid's vaporization and condensation processes. To vaporize, solvent molecules must be present at the surface of the solution. The presence of solute decreases the surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces the rate of solvent vaporization. Since the rate of condensation is unaffected by the presence of solute, the net result is that the vaporization-condensation equilibrium is achieved with fewer solvent molecules in the vapor phase (i.e., at a lower vapor pressure) (Figure 11.18). While this interpretation is useful, it does not account for several important aspects of the colligative nature of vapor pressure lowering. A more rigorous explanation involves the property of entropy, a topic of discussion in a later text chapter on thermodynamics. For purposes of understanding the lowering of a liquid's vapor pressure, it is adequate to note that the more dispersed nature of matter in a solution, compared to separate solvent and solute phases, serves to effectively stabilize the solvent molecules and hinder their vaporization. A lower vapor pressure results, and a correspondingly\nhigher boiling point as described in the next section of this module.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.18 The presence of nonvolatile solutes lowers the vapor pressure of a solution by impeding the evaporation of solvent molecules.\n\nThe relationship between the vapor pressures of solution components and the concentrations of those components is described by Raoult's law: The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution.\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{A}}=X_{\\mathrm{A}} P_{\\mathrm{A}}^{*}\n$$",

Sulfur - \nWhen rhombic sulfur melts, the straw-colored liquid is quite mobile; its viscosity is low because $\\mathrm{S}_{8}$ molecules are essentially spherical and offer relatively little resistance as they move past each other.

The liquid gradually darkens in color and becomes so viscous that finally (at about $230^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) it does not pour easily. The dangling atoms at the ends of the chains of sulfur atoms are responsible for the dark red color because their electronic structure differs from those of sulfur atoms that have bonds to two adjacent sulfur atoms.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics - \nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K ). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ).

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe other three quantum numbers, $n, l$, and $m_{l}$, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrödinger equation for electrons in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states. One is termed the $\\alpha$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being in the positive direction of the $z$ axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$. The other is called the $\\beta$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being negative and $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Entropy and Microstates - \nFollowing the work of Carnot and Clausius, Ludwig Boltzmann developed a molecular-scale statistical model that related the entropy of a system to the number of microstates ( $W$ ) possible for the system. A microstate is a specific configuration of all the locations and energies of the atoms or molecules that make up a system. The relation between a system's entropy and the number of possible microstates is\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W\n$$\n\nwhere $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, $1.38 \\times 10^{-23} \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K}$.\nAs for other state functions, the change in entropy for a process is the difference between its final ( $S_{\\mathrm{f}}$ ) and initial $\\left(S_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ values:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S=S_{\\mathrm{f}}-S_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{f}}-k \\ln W_{\\mathrm{i}}=k \\ln \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{f}}}{W_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nFor processes involving an increase in the number of microstates, $W_{\\mathrm{f}}>W_{\\mathrm{i}}$, the entropy of the system increases and $\\Delta S>0$.

This molecular-scale interpretation of entropy provides a link to the probability that a process will occur as illustrated in the next paragraphs.\n\nConsider the general case of a system comprised of $N$ particles distributed among $n$ boxes. The number of microstates possible for such a system is $n^{N}$. For example, distributing four particles among two boxes will result in $2^{4}=16$ different microstates as illustrated in Figure 12.8. Microstates with equivalent particle arrangements (not considering individual particle identities) are grouped together and are called distributions. The probability that a system will exist with its components in a given distribution is proportional to the number of microstates within the distribution. Since entropy increases logarithmically with the number of microstates, the most probable distribution is therefore the one of greatest entropy.\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)",

However, it was not until the early nineteenth century that John Dalton (1766-1844), a British schoolteacher with a keen interest in science, supported this hypothesis with quantitative measurements. Since that time, repeated experiments have confirmed many aspects of this hypothesis, and it has become one of the central theories of chemistry.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to $1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$.\n\nProtons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of $1+$ and a mass of 1.0073 amu . Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu . Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1 - and a mass of 0.00055 amu . The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) and is the property that defines an atom's elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is\napproximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.\n\nIsotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved.

You might recall from your general chemistry course that, according to the quantum mechanical model, the behavior of a specific electron in an atom can be described by a mathematical expression called a wave equation-the same type of expression used to describe the motion of waves in a fluid. The solution to a wave equation is called a wave function, or orbital, and is denoted by the lowercase Greek letter psi ( $\\psi$ ).\nWhen the square of the wave function, $\\psi^{2}$, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been. This electron cloud doesn't have a sharp boundary, but for practical purposes we can set the limits by saying that an orbital represents the space where an electron spends $90 \\%$ to $95 \\%$ of its time.\n\nWhat do orbitals look like? There are four different kinds of orbitals, denoted $s, p, d$, and $f$, each with a different shape. Of the four, we'll be concerned primarily with $s$ and $p$ orbitals because these are the most common in\norganic and biological chemistry. An $s$ orbital has a spherical shape, with the nucleus at its center; a $p$ orbital has a dumbbell shape with two parts, or lobes; and four of the five $d$ orbitals have a cloverleaf shape with four lobes, as shown in FIGURE 1.4. The fifth $d$ orbital is shaped like an elongated dumbbell with a doughnut around its middle.\n\n\nAn $s$ orbital\n\n\nA p orbital\n\n\nAd orbital\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Representations of $\\boldsymbol{s}, \\boldsymbol{p}$, and $\\boldsymbol{d}$ orbitals.

The properties of the different kinds of crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them. Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. Some crystalline solids have defects in the definite repeating pattern of their particles. These defects (which include vacancies, atoms or ions not in the regular positions, and impurities) change physical properties such as electrical conductivity, which is exploited in the silicon crystals used to manufacture computer chips.",

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

One of the smallest things we can see with our unaided eye is a single thread of a spider web: These strands are about $1 / 10,000$ of a centimeter $(0.0001 \\mathrm{~cm})$ in diameter. Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would require about 150 million carbon atom \"dimes\" to cover it.

Predicting the Sign of $\\Delta S$ - \nThe relationships between entropy, microstates, and matter/energy dispersal described previously allow us to make generalizations regarding the relative entropies of substances and to predict the sign of entropy changes for chemical and physical processes. Consider the phase changes illustrated in Figure 12.10. In the solid phase, the atoms or molecules are restricted to nearly fixed positions with respect to each other and are capable of only modest oscillations about these positions. With essentially fixed locations for the system's component particles, the number of microstates is relatively small. In the liquid phase, the atoms or molecules are free to move over and around each other, though they remain in relatively close proximity to one another. This increased freedom of motion results in a greater variation in possible particle locations, so the number of microstates is correspondingly greater than for the solid. As a result, $S_{\\text {liquid }}>S_{\\text {solid }}$ and the process of converting a substance from solid to liquid (melting) is characterized by an increase in entropy, $\\Delta S>0$. By the same logic, the reciprocal process (freezing) exhibits a decrease in entropy, $\\Delta S<0$.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.10 The entropy of a substance increases ( $\\Delta S>0$ ) as it transforms from a relatively ordered solid, to a less-ordered liquid, and then to a still less-ordered gas. The entropy decreases $(\\Delta S<0)$ as the substance transforms from a gas to a liquid and then to a solid.\n\nNow consider the gaseous phase, in which a given number of atoms or molecules occupy a much greater volume than in the liquid phase. Each atom or molecule can be found in many more locations, corresponding to a much greater number of microstates. Consequently, for any substance, $S_{\\text {gas }}>S_{\\text {liquid }}>S_{\\text {solid }}$, and the processes of vaporization and sublimation likewise involve increases in entropy, $\\Delta S>0$. Likewise, the reciprocal phase transitions, condensation and deposition, involve decreases in entropy, $\\Delta S<0$.",

Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the remaining Crab Nebula (Figure 3.1) continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms.

What's \"Free\" about $\\Delta G$ ? - \nIn addition to indicating spontaneity, the free energy change also provides information regarding the amount of useful work ( $w$ ) that may be accomplished by a spontaneous process. Although a rigorous treatment of this subject is beyond the scope of an introductory chemistry text, a brief discussion is helpful for gaining a better perspective on this important thermodynamic property.\n\nFor this purpose, consider a spontaneous, exothermic process that involves a decrease in entropy. The free energy, as defined by\n\n$$\n\\Delta G=\\Delta H-T \\Delta S\n$$\n\nmay be interpreted as representing the difference between the energy produced by the process, $\\Delta H$, and the energy lost to the surroundings, $T \\Delta S$.

Band Theory - \nIn order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is \"easy\" to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so \"large\" that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when \"moderate\" amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.\n\nSemiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells.

If so, we would observe only a single NMR absorption signal in the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ spectrum of a molecule, a situation that would be of little use. In fact, the absorption frequency is not the same for all ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or all ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nuclei.\n\nAll nuclei in molecules are surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule, the electrons moving around nuclei set up tiny local magnetic fields of their own. These local magnetic fields act in opposition to the applied field so that the effective field actually felt by the nucleus is a bit weaker than the applied field.\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {effective }}=B_{\\text {applied }}=B_{\\text {local }}\n$$\n\nIn describing this effect of local fields, we say that nuclei experience shielding from the full effect of the applied field by the surrounding electrons. Because each chemically distinct nucleus in a molecule is in a slightly different electronic environment, each nucleus is shielded to a slightly different extent and the effective magnetic field felt by each is slightly different. These tiny differences in the effective magnetic fields experienced by different nuclei can be detected, and we thus see a distinct NMR signal for each chemically distinct ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ or ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus in a molecule. As a result, an NMR spectrum effectively maps the carbon-hydrogen framework of an organic molecule. With practice, it's possible to read this map and derive structural information.",

Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

For many main group atoms and molecules, the absorbed photons are in the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum, which cannot be detected by the human eye. For coordination compounds, the energy difference between the $d$ orbitals often allows photons in the visible range to be absorbed.\n\nThe human eye perceives a mixture of all the colors, in the proportions present in sunlight, as white light. Complementary colors, those located across from each other on a color wheel, are also used in color vision. The eye perceives a mixture of two complementary colors, in the proper proportions, as white light. Likewise, when a color is missing from white light, the eye sees its complement. For example, when red photons are absorbed from white light, the eyes see the color green. When violet photons are removed from white light, the eyes see lemon yellow. The blue color of the $\\left[\\mathrm{Cu}\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)_{4}\\right]^{2+}$ ion results because this ion absorbs orange and red light, leaving the complementary colors of blue and green (Figure 19.37).\n\n\nFIGURE 19.37 (a) An object is black if it absorbs all colors of light.

Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Answer: - \nred, 620-800 nm\n\nSmall changes in the relative energies of the orbitals that electrons are transitioning between can lead to drastic shifts in the color of light absorbed. Therefore, the colors of coordination compounds depend on many factors. As shown in Figure 19.38, different aqueous metal ions can have different colors. In addition, different oxidation states of one metal can produce different colors, as shown for the vanadium complexes in the link below.\n\n\nFIGURE 19.38 The partially filled $d$ orbitals of the stable ions $\\mathrm{Cr}^{3+}(\\mathrm{aq}), \\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}(\\mathrm{aq})$, and $\\mathrm{Co}^{2+}(\\mathrm{aq})$ (left, center and right, respectively) give rise to various colors.

For example, the iron(II) complex $\\left[\\mathrm{Fe}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{6}\\right] \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ appears blue-green because the high-spin complex absorbs photons in the red wavelengths (Figure 19.39).

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current. This sign shows the elaborate artistic effects that can be achieved. (credit: Dave Shaver)\n\nEach emission line consists of a single wavelength of light, which implies that the light emitted by a gas consists of a set of discrete energies. For example, when an electric discharge passes through a tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecules are broken apart into separate H atoms and we see a blue-pink color. Passing the light through a prism produces a line spectrum, indicating that this light is composed of photons of four visible wavelengths, as shown in Figure 3.13.",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom. Bohr won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to our understanding of the structure of atoms and how that is related to line spectra emissions.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states.

For example, hydrogen and oxygen can react to form water, and sodium and chlorine can react to form table salt. We sometimes describe the composition of these compounds with an empirical formula, which indicates the types of atoms present and the simplest whole-number ratio of the number of atoms (or ions) in the compound. For example, titanium dioxide (used as pigment in white paint and in the thick, white, blocking type of sunscreen) has an empirical formula of $\\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$.

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Organisms rely on proteins for a variety of functions-proteins transport molecules across cell membranes, replicate DNA, and catalyze metabolic reactions, to name only a few of their functions. The properties of proteins are functions of the combination of amino acids that compose them and can vary greatly. Interactions between amino acid sequences in the chains of proteins result in the folding of the chain into specific, threedimensional structures that determine the protein's activity.\n\nAmino acids are organic molecules that contain an amine functional group ( $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ), a carboxylic acid functional group ( -COOH ), and a side chain (that is specific to each individual amino acid). Most living things build proteins from the same 20 different amino acids. Amino acids connect by the formation of a peptide bond, which is a covalent bond formed between two amino acids when the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid reacts with the amine group of the other amino acid. The formation of the bond results in the production of a molecule of water (in general, reactions that result in the production of water when two other molecules combine are referred to as condensation reactions). The resulting bond-between the carbonyl group carbon atom and the amine nitrogen atom is called a peptide link or peptide bond. Since each of the original amino acids has an unreacted group (one has an unreacted amine and the other an unreacted carboxylic acid), more peptide bonds can form to other amino acids, extending the structure. (Figure 21.20) A chain of connected amino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins contain at least one long polypeptide chain.\n\n\nFIGURE 21.20 This condensation reaction forms a dipeptide from two amino acids and leads to the formation of water.",

Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are determined either by NMR or by X-ray crystallography (Chapter 12 Chemistry Matters).\n\nThe most common secondary structures are the $\\alpha$ helix and the $\\beta$-pleated sheet. An $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ helix is a right-handed coil of the protein backbone, much like the coil of a spiral staircase (FIGURE 26.6a). Each turn of the helix contains 3.6 amino acid residues, with a distance between coils of 540 pm , or 5.4 A. The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between amide $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{H}$ groups and $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ groups four residues away, with an $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{H} \\cdots \\mathrm{O}$ distance of $2.8 \\AA$. The $\\alpha$ helix is an extremely common secondary structure, and nearly all globular proteins contain many helical segments.

Since these wavelengths are comparable to the spaces between atoms in a crystalline solid, X-rays are scattered when they pass through crystals. The scattered rays undergo constructive and destructive interference that creates a specific diffraction pattern that may be measured and used to precisely determine the positions of atoms within the crystal. This phenomenon of X-ray diffraction is the basis for very powerful techniques enabling the determination of molecular structure. One of the pioneers who applied this powerful technology to important biochemical substances was Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin.\n\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, in 1910 to British parents, Dorothy's fascination with chemistry was fostered early in her life. At age 11 she was enrolled in a prestigious English grammar school where she was one of just two girls allowed to study chemistry. On her 16th birthday, her mother, Molly, gifted her a book on X-ray crystallography, which had a profound impact on the trajectory of her career. She studied chemistry at Oxford University, graduating with first-class honors in 1932 and directly entering Cambridge University to pursue a doctoral degree. At Cambridge, Dorothy recognized the promise of X-ray crystallography for protein structure determinations, conducting research that earned her a PhD in 1937. Over the course of a very productive career, Dr. Hodgkin was credited with determining structures for several important biomolecules, including cholesterol iodide, penicillin, and vitamin B12. In recognition of her achievements in the use of X-ray techniques to elucidate the structures of biochemical substances, she was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1969, she led a team of scientists who deduced the structure of insulin, facilitating the mass production of this hormone and greatly advancing the treatment of diabetic patients worldwide. Dr. Hodgkin continued working with the international scientific community, earning numerous distinctions and awards prior to her death in 1993.",

The Third Law of Thermodynamics - \nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system. With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K ). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W=k \\ln (1)=0\n$$\n\nThis limiting condition for a system's entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance's entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions. Standard entropies ( $\\boldsymbol{S}^{\\circ}$ ) are for one mole of substance under standard conditions (a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 298.15 K ; see details regarding standard conditions in the thermochemistry chapter of this text).

Why does a protein adopt the shape it does? The forces that determine the tertiary structure of a protein are the same forces that act on all molecules, regardless of size, to provide maximum stability. Particularly important are the hydrophilic (water-loving; Section 2.12) interactions of the polar side chains on acidic or basic amino acids and the hydrophobic (water-fearing) interactions of nonpolar\nside chains. These acidic or basic amino acids with charged side chains tend to congregate on the exterior of the protein, where they can be solvated by water. Amino acids with neutral, nonpolar side chains tend to congregate on the hydrocarbon-like interior of a protein molecule, away from the aqueous medium.\n\nAlso important for stabilizing a protein's tertiary structure are the formation of disulfide bridges between cysteine residues, the formation of hydrogen bonds between nearby amino acid residues, and the presence of ionic attractions, called salt bridges, between positively and negatively charged sites on various amino acid side chains within the protein.\n\nBecause the tertiary structure of a globular protein is delicately maintained by weak intramolecular attractions, a modest change in temperature or pH is often enough to disrupt that structure and cause the protein to become denatured. Denaturation occurs under such mild conditions that the primary structure remains intact, but the tertiary structure unfolds from a specific globular shape to a randomly looped chain (FIGURE 26.8).\n\n\nFIGURE 26.8 A representation of protein denaturation.

Twenty amino acids are commonly found in proteins, and all except glycine have stereochemistry similar to that of L sugars.

Alternatively, an enantioselective synthesis of amino acids can be carried out using a chiral hydrogenation catalyst.\n\nDetermining the structure of a peptide or protein begins with amino acid analysis. The peptide is hydrolyzed to its constituent $\\alpha$-amino acids, which are separated and identified. Next, the peptide is sequenced. Edman degradation by treatment with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) cleaves one residue from the N terminus of the peptide and forms an easily identifiable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative of the $\\mathbf{N}$-terminal amino acid. An automated series of Edman degradations can sequence peptide chains up to 50 residues in length.\n\nPeptide synthesis involves the use of protecting groups. An N-protected amino acid with a free $-\\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\mathrm{H}$ group is coupled using DCC or EDC to an O-protected amino acid with a free $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ group.

For purposes of this chapter's discussion, it will suffice to consider two criteria that favor, but do not guarantee, the spontaneous formation of a solution:\n\n1. a decrease in the internal energy of the system (an exothermic change, as discussed in the previous chapter on thermochemistry)\n2. an increased dispersal of matter in the system (which indicates an increase in the entropy of the system, as you will learn about in the later chapter on thermodynamics)\n\nIn the process of dissolution, an internal energy change often, but not always, occurs as heat is absorbed or evolved. An increase in matter dispersal always results when a solution forms from the uniform distribution of solute molecules throughout a solvent.\n\nWhen the strengths of the intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species in a solution are no different than those present in the separated components, the solution is formed with no accompanying energy change. Such a solution is called an ideal solution. A mixture of ideal gases (or gases such as helium and argon, which closely approach ideal behavior) is an example of an ideal solution, since the entities comprising these gases experience no significant intermolecular attractions.\n\n1 If bubbles of gas are observed within the liquid, the mixture is not homogeneous and, thus, not a solution.\n\nWhen containers of helium and argon are connected, the gases spontaneously mix due to diffusion and form a solution (Figure 11.3). The formation of this solution clearly involves an increase in matter dispersal, since the helium and argon atoms occupy a volume twice as large as that which each occupied before mixing.\n\n\nValve closed\n\n\nValve open",

Properties of Solids - \nA crystalline solid, like those listed in Table 10.4, has a precise melting temperature because each atom or molecule of the same type is held in place with the same forces or energy. Thus, the attractions between the units that make up the crystal all have the same strength and all require the same amount of energy to be broken. The gradual softening of an amorphous material differs dramatically from the distinct melting of a crystalline solid. This results from the structural nonequivalence of the molecules in the amorphous solid. Some forces are weaker than others, and when an amorphous material is heated, the weakest intermolecular attractions break first. As the temperature is increased further, the stronger attractions are broken. Thus amorphous materials soften over a range of temperatures.\n\nTypes of Crystalline Solids and Their Properties",

X-ray Crystallographer Rosalind Franklin - \nThe discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 by Francis Crick and James Watson is one of the great achievements in the history of science. They were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, along with Maurice Wilkins, who provided experimental proof of DNA's structure. British chemist Rosalind Franklin made invaluable contributions to this monumental achievement through her work in measuring X-ray diffraction images of DNA. Early in her career, Franklin's research on the structure of coals proved helpful to the British war effort. After shifting her focus to biological systems in the early 1950s, Franklin and doctoral student Raymond Gosling discovered that DNA consists of two forms: a long, thin fiber formed when wet (type \"B\") and a short, wide fiber formed when dried (type \"A\"). Her X-ray diffraction images of DNA (Figure 10.66) provided the crucial information that allowed Watson and Crick to confirm that DNA forms a double helix, and to determine details of its size and structure. Franklin also conducted pioneering research on viruses and the RNA that contains their genetic information, uncovering new information that radically changed the body of knowledge in the field. After developing ovarian cancer, Franklin continued\nto work until her death in 1958 at age 37. Among many posthumous recognitions of her work, the Chicago Medical School of Finch University of Health Sciences changed its name to the Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science in 2004, and adopted an image of her famous X-ray diffraction image of DNA as its official university logo.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.66 This illustration shows an X-ray diffraction image similar to the one Franklin found in her research.

A more thorough treatment of solution properties is provided in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but provided here is an introduction to some of the basic properties of solutions.\n\nThe relative amount of a given solution component is known as its concentration. Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component is called the solvent and may be viewed as the medium in which the other components are dispersed, or dissolved. Solutions in which water is the solvent are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the solvent is called an aqueous solution.\n\nA solute is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with qualitative terms such as dilute (of relatively low concentration) and concentrated (of relatively high concentration).\n\nConcentrations may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of measurement units, each convenient for particular applications.

Proteins and Enzymes - \nFIGURE 21.20 This condensation reaction forms a dipeptide from two amino acids and leads to the formation of water.\n\nEnzymes are large biological molecules, mostly composed of proteins, which are responsible for the thousands of metabolic processes that occur in living organisms. Enzymes are highly specific catalysts; they speed up the rates of certain reactions. Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the reaction they are catalyzing, which can dramatically increase the rate of the reaction. Most reactions catalyzed by enzymes have rates that are millions of times faster than the noncatalyzed version. Like all catalysts, enzymes are not consumed during the reactions that they catalyze. Enzymes do differ from other catalysts in how specific they are for their substrates (the molecules that an enzyme will convert into a different product). Each enzyme is only capable of speeding up one or a few very specific reactions or types of reactions. Since the function of enzymes is so specific, the lack or malfunctioning of an enzyme can lead to serious health consequences. One disease that is the result of an enzyme malfunction is phenylketonuria. In this disease, the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the degradation of the amino acid phenylalanine is not functional (Figure 21.21). Untreated, this can lead to an accumulation of phenylalanine, which can lead to intellectual disabilities.\n\n\nFIGURE 21.21 A computer rendering shows the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.

Like all catalysts, an enzyme doesn't affect the equilibrium constant of a reaction and can't bring about a chemical change that is otherwise unfavorable. An enzyme acts only to lower the activation energy for a reaction, thereby making the reaction take place more rapidly than it otherwise would. Sometimes, in fact, the rate acceleration brought about by enzymes is extraordinary. Millionfold rate increases are common, and the glycosidase enzymes that hydrolyze polysaccharides increase the reaction rate by a factor of more than $10^{17}$, changing the time required for the reaction from millions of years to milliseconds!\n\nUnlike many of the catalysts that chemists use in the laboratory, enzymes are usually specific in their action. Often, in fact, an enzyme will catalyze only a single reaction of a single compound, called the enzyme's substrate. For example, the enzyme amylase, found in the human digestive tract, catalyzes only the hydrolysis of starch to yield glucose; cellulose and other polysaccharides are untouched by amylase.\n\nDifferent enzymes have different specificities. Some, such as amylase, are specific for a single substrate, but others operate on a range of substrates. Papain, for instance, a globular protein of 212 amino acids isolated from papaya fruit, catalyzes the hydrolysis of many kinds of peptide bonds. In fact, it's this ability to hydrolyze peptide bonds that makes papain useful as a cleaner for contact lenses.\n\n\nEnzymes function through a pathway that involves initial formation of an enzyme-substrate complex (E $\\cdot \\mathrm{S}$ ), followed by a multistep chemical conversion of the enzyme-bound substrate into enzyme-bound product ( $\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{P}$ )\nand final release of product from the complex.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{E}+\\mathrm{S} \\rightleftarrows \\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{~S} \\rightleftarrows \\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{P} \\rightleftarrows \\mathrm{E}+\\mathrm{P}\n$$",

This extraordinary achievement was reported in 1973 as the culmination of a collaborative effort headed by Robert B. Woodward of Harvard University and Albert Eschenmoser of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. More than 100 graduate students and postdoctoral associates contributed to the work, which took more than a decade to complete.\n\n\nVitamin $B_{12}$\nWhy put such extraordinary effort into the laboratory synthesis of a molecule so easily obtained from natural sources? There are many reasons. On a basic human level, a chemist might be motivated primarily by the challenge, much as a climber might be challenged by the ascent of a difficult peak. Beyond the pure challenge, the completion of a difficult synthesis is also valuable in that it establishes new standards and raises the field to a new level. If vitamin $B_{12}$ can be made, then why can't any molecule found in nature be made? Indeed, the decades that have passed since the work of Woodward and Eschenmoser have seen the laboratory synthesis of many enormously complex and valuable substances. Sometimes these substances-for instance, the anticancer compound paclitaxel, trade named Taxol-are not easily available in nature, so laboratory synthesis is the only\nmethod for obtaining larger quantities.",

Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the mole, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.\n\nThe mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a sample of matter. One Latin connotation for the word \"mole\" is \"large mass\" or \"bulk,\" which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space.

An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for $A$ and faster reaction rates.\nThe exponential term, $e^{-E a / R T}$, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules.

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

LINK TO LEARNING - \nClick here (http://openstax.org/l/16JJThomson) to hear Thomson describe his discovery in his own voice.\n\nIn 1909, more information about the electron was uncovered by American physicist Robert A. Millikan via his \"oil drop\" experiments. Millikan created microscopic oil droplets, which could be electrically charged by friction as they formed or by using X-rays. These droplets initially fell due to gravity, but their downward progress could be slowed or even reversed by an electric field lower in the apparatus. By adjusting the electric field strength and making careful measurements and appropriate calculations, Millikan was able to determine the charge on individual drops (Figure 2.7).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.7 Millikan's experiment measured the charge of individual oil drops. The tabulated data are examples of a few possible values.\n\nLooking at the charge data that Millikan gathered, you may have recognized that the charge of an oil droplet is always a multiple of a specific charge, $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$. Millikan concluded that this value must therefore be a fundamental charge-the charge of a single electron-with his measured charges due to an excess of one electron ( 1 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), two electrons ( 2 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), three electrons ( 3 times $1.6 \\times 10^{-19} \\mathrm{C}$ ), and so on, on a given oil droplet.

The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

Stoichiometry of Gaseous Substances, Mixtures, and Reactions LEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Use the ideal gas law to compute gas densities and molar masses\n- Perform stoichiometric calculations involving gaseous substances\n- State Dalton's law of partial pressures and use it in calculations involving gaseous mixtures\n\nThe study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine Lavoisier, widely regarded as the \"father of modern chemistry,\" changed chemistry from a qualitative to a quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death, mathematician and astronomer JosephLouis Lagrange said, \"It took the mob only a moment to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.\" ${ }^{2}$ Much of the knowledge we do have about Lavoisier's contributions is due to his wife, MarieAnne Paulze Lavoisier, who worked with him in his lab. A trained artist fluent in several languages, she created detailed illustrations of the equipment in his lab, and translated texts from foreign scientists to complement his knowledge. After his execution, she was instrumental in publishing Lavoisier's major treatise, which unified many concepts of chemistry and laid the groundwork for significant further study.\n\nAs described in an earlier chapter of this text, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for answers to many of the questions that ask \"How much?\" The essential property involved in such use of stoichiometry is the amount of substance, typically measured in moles ( $n$ ). For gases, molar amount can be derived from convenient experimental measurements of pressure, temperature, and volume. Therefore, these measurements are useful in assessing the stoichiometry of pure gases, gas mixtures, and chemical reactions involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts we have already discussed.\n\n[^5]",

And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.\n\nThis type of calculation usually involves the use of Hess's law, which states: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps. Hess's law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish.

As in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms at the corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the University of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene.\n\nThe simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.\n\nThere currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced electronic devices and for thermal management applications.\n\nCarbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on.

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

These very different properties stem from the different arrangements of the carbon atoms in the different allotropes.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.43 Diamond is extremely hard because of the strong bonding between carbon atoms in all directions.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states.

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals.

The loosely held electrons in the resonating $\\pi$ bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite.\n\nOther forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke. Carbon black is an amorphous form of carbon prepared by the incomplete combustion of natural gas, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$. It is possible to produce charcoal and coke by heating wood and coal, respectively, at high temperatures in the absence of air.\n\nRecently, new forms of elemental carbon molecules have been identified in the soot generated by a smoky flame and in the vapor produced when graphite is heated to very high temperatures in a vacuum or in helium. One of these new forms, first isolated by Professor Richard Smalley and coworkers at Rice University, consists of icosahedral (soccer-ball-shaped) molecules that contain 60 carbon atoms, $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$. This is buckminsterfullerene (often called bucky balls) after the architect Buckminster Fuller, who designed domed structures, which have a similar appearance (Figure 18.22).\n\n\nFIGURE 18.22 The molecular structure of $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$, buckminsterfullerene, is icosahedral.",

You might recall from your general chemistry course that, according to the quantum mechanical model, the behavior of a specific electron in an atom can be described by a mathematical expression called a wave equation-the same type of expression used to describe the motion of waves in a fluid. The solution to a wave equation is called a wave function, or orbital, and is denoted by the lowercase Greek letter psi ( $\\psi$ ).\nWhen the square of the wave function, $\\psi^{2}$, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been. This electron cloud doesn't have a sharp boundary, but for practical purposes we can set the limits by saying that an orbital represents the space where an electron spends $90 \\%$ to $95 \\%$ of its time.\n\nWhat do orbitals look like? There are four different kinds of orbitals, denoted $s, p, d$, and $f$, each with a different shape. Of the four, we'll be concerned primarily with $s$ and $p$ orbitals because these are the most common in\norganic and biological chemistry. An $s$ orbital has a spherical shape, with the nucleus at its center; a $p$ orbital has a dumbbell shape with two parts, or lobes; and four of the five $d$ orbitals have a cloverleaf shape with four lobes, as shown in FIGURE 1.4. The fifth $d$ orbital is shaped like an elongated dumbbell with a doughnut around its middle.\n\n\nAn $s$ orbital\n\n\nA p orbital\n\n\nAd orbital\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Representations of $\\boldsymbol{s}, \\boldsymbol{p}$, and $\\boldsymbol{d}$ orbitals.

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

After many more experiments, Rutherford also discovered that the nuclei of other elements contain the hydrogen nucleus as a \"building block,\" and he named this more fundamental particle the proton, the positively charged, subatomic particle found in the nucleus.

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long. In addition, the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR spectrum shows a single sharp resonance line at $5.78 \\mathrm{\\delta}$, a value characteristic of an alkene rather than an aromatic molecule.\n\nWhat's so special about $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons? Why do $2,6,10,14 \\pi$ electrons lead to aromatic stability, while other numbers of electrons do not? The answer comes from molecular orbital theory. When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$. Any other number would leave an energy level partially filled.\n\nThe six $\\pi$ molecular orbitals of benzene were shown previously in FIGURE 15.5, and their relative energies are shown again in FIGURE 15.6. The lowest-energy MO, $\\psi_{1}$, occurs singly and contains two electrons. The next two lowest-energy orbitals, $\\psi_{2}$ and $\\psi_{3}$, are degenerate, and it therefore takes four electrons to fill both.

Figure 5.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 5.2.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm , which is the bond length observed for the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule.\n\nIn addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two $s$ orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 5.3 illustrates this for two $p$ orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 3.30.\n\nCovalent Radii of the Halogen Group Elements\n\n| Atom | Covalent radius (pm) | Nuclear charge |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| F | 64 | +9 |\n| Cl | 99 | +17 |\n| Br | 114 | +35 |\n| I | 133 | +53 |\n| At | 148 | +85 |\n\nTABLE 3.2\n\n\nFIGURE 3.30 (a) The radius of an atom is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei in a molecule consisting of two identical atoms joined by a covalent bond.

Soot has been used as a pigment (often called carbon black) for thousands of years. Charcoal, high in carbon content, has likewise been critical to human development. Carbon is the key additive to iron in the steelmaking process, and diamonds have a unique place in both culture and industry. With all this usage came significant study, particularly with the emergence of organic chemistry. And even with all the known forms and functions of the element, scientists began to uncover the potential for even more varied and extensive carbon structures.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, chemists began to observe complex carbon structures, but they had little evidence to support their concepts, or their work did not make it into the mainstream. Eiji Osawa predicted a spherical form based on observations of a similar structure, but his work was not widely known outside Japan. In a similar manner, the most comprehensive advance was likely computational chemist Elena Galpern's, who in 1973 predicted a highly stable, 60-carbon molecule; her work was also isolated to her native Russia. Still later, Harold Kroto, working with Canadian radio astronomers, sought to uncover the nature of long carbon chains that had been discovered in interstellar space.\n\nKroto sought to use a machine developed by Richard Smalley's team at Rice University to learn more about these structures. Together with Robert Curl, who had introduced them, and three graduate students-James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Yuan Liu-they performed an intensive series of experiments that led to a major discovery.\n\nIn 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard Smalley (Figure 4.12), Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their work in discovering a new form of carbon, the $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$ buckminsterfullerene molecule (Figure 4.1). An entire class of compounds, including spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$. This type of molecule, called a fullerene, shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and shape, fullerenes can encapsulate other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from hydrogen storage to targeted drug delivery systems.

However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.\n\nValence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms' positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.",

The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are inphase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.\n\nIn a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 5.39 shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the \"band gap\" between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valance band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors are in between: they conduct electricity better than insulators, but not as well as conductors.",

Carbons bonded to oxygen, nitrogen, or halogen absorb downfield (to the left) of typical alkane carbons. Because electronegative atoms attract electrons, they pull electrons away from neighboring carbon atoms, causing those carbons to be deshielded and to come into resonance at a lower field.\n\nAnother trend is that $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbons generally absorb from 0 to $90 \\delta$, while $s p^{2}$ carbons absorb from 110 to 220 .

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

For example, reaction of $\\beta$-D-glucopyranose with methanol gives a mixture of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ methyl D-glucopyranosides. (Note that a glycoside is the functional group name for any sugar, whereas a glucoside is formed specifically from glucose.)\n\n\nGlycosides are named by first citing the alkyl group and then replacing the -ose ending of the sugar with -oside. Like all acetals, glycosides are stable in neutral water. They aren't in equilibrium with an open-chain form, and they don't show mutarotation. They can, however, be hydrolyzed to give back the free monosaccharide plus alcohol on treatment with aqueous acid (Section 19.10).\n\nGlycosides are abundant in nature, and many biologically important molecules contain glycosidic linkages. For example, digitoxin, the active component of the digitalis preparations used for treatment of heart disease, is a glycoside consisting of a steroid alcohol linked to a trisaccharide. Note also that the three sugars are linked to one another by glycoside bonds.\n\n\nDigitoxin, a glycoside\nThe laboratory synthesis of glycosides can be difficult because of the numerous -OH groups on the sugar molecule.

One of the most important methods used was the Kiliani-Fischer synthesis, which results in the lengthening of an aldose chain by one carbon atom. The C1 aldehyde group of the starting sugar becomes C2 of the chain-lengthened sugar, and a new C1 carbon is added. For example, an aldopentose is converted by Kiliani-Fischer synthesis into two aldohexoses.\n\nDiscovery of the chain-lengthening sequence was initiated by the observation of Heinrich Kiliani in 1886 that aldoses react with HCN to form cyanohydrins (Section 19.6). Emil Fischer immediately realized the importance of Kiliani's discovery and devised a method for converting the cyanohydrin nitrile group into an aldehyde.\n\nFischer's original method for conversion of the nitrile into an aldehyde involved hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid, ring closure to a cyclic ester (lactone), and subsequent reduction. A modern improvement involves reducing the nitrile over a palladium catalyst, yielding an imine intermediate that is hydrolyzed to an aldehyde. Note that the cyanohydrin is formed as a mixture of stereoisomers at the new chirality center, so two new aldoses, differing only in their stereochemistry at C2, result from Kiliani-Fischer synthesis. Chain extension of D-arabinose, for example, yields a mixture of D -glucose and D -mannose.\n\n\nPROBLEM What product(s) would you expect from Kiliani-Fischer reaction of D-ribose?\n25-21\nPROBLEM What aldopentose would give a mixture of L-gulose and L-idose on Kiliani-Fischer chain extension? 25-22",

In comparing laboratory reactions with biological reactions, several differences are apparent. For one, laboratory reactions are usually carried out in an organic solvent such as diethyl ether or dichloromethane to dissolve the reactants and bring them into contact, whereas biological reactions occur in the aqueous medium within cells. For another, laboratory reactions often take place over a wide range of temperatures without catalysts, while biological reactions take place at the temperature of the organism and are catalyzed by enzymes.\n\nWe'll look at enzymes in more detail in Section 26.10, but you may already be aware that an enzyme is a large, globular, protein molecule that contains in its structure a protected pocket called its active site. The active site is lined by acidic or basic groups as needed for catalysis and has precisely the right shape to bind and hold a substrate molecule in the orientation necessary for reaction. FIGURE 6.10 shows a molecular model of hexokinase, along with an X-ray crystal structure of the glucose substrate and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) bound in the active site. Hexokinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the initial step of glucose metabolism-the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to glucose, giving glucose 6-phosphate and ADP. The structures of ATP and ADP were shown at the end of Section 6.8.\n\n\nNote how the hexokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation reaction of glucose is written. It's common when writing biological equations to show only the structures of the primary reactant and product, while abbreviating the structures of various biological \"reagents\" and by-products such as ATP and ADP. A curved arrow intersecting the straight reaction arrow indicates that ATP is also a reactant and ADP also a product.\n\n\nFIGURE 6.10 Models of hexokinase in space-filling and wire-frame formats, showing the cleft that contains the active site where substrate binding and reaction catalysis occur.

Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes and ketones. They are classified according to the number of carbon atoms and the kind of carbonyl group they contain. Glucose, for example, is an aldohexose, a six-carbon aldehydo sugar. Monosaccharides are further classified as either d sugars or l sugars, depending on the stereochemistry of the chirality center farthest from the carbonyl group. Carbohydrate stereochemistry is frequently depicted using Fischer projections, which represent a chirality center as the intersection of two crossed lines.\n\nMonosaccharides normally exist as cyclic hemiacetals rather than as open-chain aldehydes or ketones. The hemiacetal linkage results from reaction of the carbonyl group with an -OH group three or four carbon atoms away. A five-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called a furanose, and a six-membered cyclic hemiacetal is called a pyranose. Cyclization leads to the formation of a new chirality center called the anomeric center and the production of two diastereomeric hemiacetals called alpha ( $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ ) and beta ( $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ ) anomers.\n\nMuch of the chemistry of monosaccharides is the familiar chemistry of alcohols and aldehydes/ketones. Thus, the hydroxyl groups of carbohydrates form esters and ethers. The carbonyl group of a monosaccharide can be reduced with $\\mathrm{NaBH}_{4}$ to form an alditol, oxidized with aqueous $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ to form an aldonic acid, oxidized with $\\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to form an aldaric acid, oxidized enzymatically to form a uronic acid, or treated with an alcohol in the presence of acid to form a glycoside. Monosaccharides can also be chain-lengthened by the multistep Kiliani-Fischer synthesis and can be chain-shortened by Wohl degradation.",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom.

The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space.

This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital.

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins).

Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure - \nFIGURE 3.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale).\n\nElectrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the $5 p$ orbitals fill immediately after the $4 d$, and immediately before the $6 s$. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, $n$, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of 1 increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order $s>p>d>f$. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron-nucleus attractions slightly (recall\nthat all electrons have -1 charges, but nuclei have $+Z$ charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals ( $1 s$ through $3 p$ ), the increase in energy due to $n$ is more significant than the increase due to $l$; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.\n\nThe arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom.

You might recall from your general chemistry course that, according to the quantum mechanical model, the behavior of a specific electron in an atom can be described by a mathematical expression called a wave equation-the same type of expression used to describe the motion of waves in a fluid. The solution to a wave equation is called a wave function, or orbital, and is denoted by the lowercase Greek letter psi ( $\\psi$ ).\nWhen the square of the wave function, $\\psi^{2}$, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been. This electron cloud doesn't have a sharp boundary, but for practical purposes we can set the limits by saying that an orbital represents the space where an electron spends $90 \\%$ to $95 \\%$ of its time.\n\nWhat do orbitals look like? There are four different kinds of orbitals, denoted $s, p, d$, and $f$, each with a different shape. Of the four, we'll be concerned primarily with $s$ and $p$ orbitals because these are the most common in\norganic and biological chemistry.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom.

However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire $d$ block (colored yellow in Figure 3.29), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.\n3. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an $f$ orbital. They are shown in green in Figure 3.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the $(n-2) f$, the $(n-1) d$, and the $n s$ subshells. There are two inner transition series:\na. The lanthanide series: lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu)\nb. The actinide series: actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)\n\nLanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no $f$ electrons.",

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (\"to build up\"). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be $4 \\mathrm{~s}(\\mathrm{~K}, \\mathrm{Ca})$, followed by the $3 d$ orbitals.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron configurations.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.27 This partial periodic table shows electron configurations for the valence subshells of atoms.

The nucleus consists of subatomic particles called neutrons, which are electrically neutral, and protons, which are positively charged. Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The three-dimensional view on the right shows calculated electron-density surfaces. Electron density increases steadily toward the nucleus and is 40 times greater at the blue solid surface than at the gray mesh surface.\n\nAlthough extremely small-about $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$ meter ( m ) in diameter-the nucleus nevertheless contains essentially all the mass of the atom. Electrons have negligible mass and circulate around the nucleus at a distance of approximately $10^{-10} \\mathrm{~m}$.

Electron configurations and orbital diagrams can be determined by applying the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can have the same set of four quantum numbers) and Hund's rule (whenever possible, electrons retain unpaired spins in degenerate orbitals).\n\nElectrons in the outermost orbitals, called valence electrons, are responsible for most of the chemical behavior of elements. In the periodic table, elements with analogous valence electron configurations usually occur within the same group. There are some exceptions to the predicted filling order, particularly when half-filled or completely filled orbitals can be formed. The periodic table can be divided into three categories based on the orbital in which the last electron to be added is placed: main group elements ( $s$ and $p$ orbitals), transition\nelements ( $d$ orbitals), and inner transition elements (forbitals).",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result.

Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital.

The bonding orbital is lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are inphase in the molecular orbital. The antibonding orbital is higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals because the atomic orbitals are out-of-phase.\n\nIn a solid, similar things happen, but on a much larger scale. Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result. Each bonding orbital will show an energy lowering as the atomic orbitals are mostly in-phase, but each of the bonding orbitals will be a little different and have slightly different energies. The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band. Likewise, all the antibonding orbitals are very close together and form a band, called the conduction band. Figure 5.39 shows the bands for three important classes of materials: insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.39 Molecular orbitals in solids are so closely spaced that they are described as bands. The valence band is lower in energy and the conduction band is higher in energy. The type of solid is determined by the size of the \"band gap\" between the valence and conduction bands. Only a very small amount of energy is required to move electrons from the valance band to the conduction band in a conductor, and so they conduct electricity well. In an insulator, the band gap is large, so that very few electrons move, and they are poor conductors of electricity.

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 3.30.\n\nCovalent Radii of the Halogen Group Elements\n\n| Atom | Covalent radius (pm) | Nuclear charge |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| F | 64 | +9 |\n| Cl | 99 | +17 |\n| Br | 114 | +35 |\n| I | 133 | +53 |\n| At | 148 | +85 |\n\nTABLE 3.2\n\n\nFIGURE 3.30 (a) The radius of an atom is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei in a molecule consisting of two identical atoms joined by a covalent bond.

Because the atoms are on identical lattice points, they have identical environments.\n\n\nFace-centered cubic structure\nFIGURE 10.52 A face-centered cubic solid has atoms at the corners and, as the name implies, at the centers of the faces of its unit cells.\n\nAtoms in an FCC arrangement are packed as closely together as possible, with atoms occupying $74 \\%$ of the volume. This structure is also called cubic closest packing (CCP). In CCP, there are three repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. Each atom contacts six atoms in its own layer, three in the layer above, and three in the layer below. In this arrangement, each atom touches 12 near neighbors, and therefore has a coordination number of 12 . The fact that FCC and CCP arrangements are equivalent may not be immediately obvious, but why they are actually the same structure is illustrated in Figure 10.53.\n\n\nSide view\n\n\nTop view\n\n\nRotated view\n\nCubic closest packed structure\nFIGURE 10.53 A CCP arrangement consists of three repeating layers (ABCABC...) of hexagonally arranged atoms.

By rotating our perspective, we can see that a CCP structure has a unit cell with a face containing an atom from layer A at one corner, atoms from layer B across a diagonal (at two corners and in the middle of the face), and an atom from layer C at the remaining corner. This is the same as a face-centered cubic arrangement.",

Lattice point locations - \nBecause closer packing maximizes the overall attractions between atoms and minimizes the total intermolecular energy, the atoms in most metals pack in this manner.

Both consist of repeating layers of hexagonally arranged atoms. In both types, a second layer (B) is placed on the first layer (A) so that each atom in the second layer is in contact with three atoms in the first layer. The third layer is positioned in one of two ways.

Carbon is the key additive to iron in the steelmaking process, and diamonds have a unique place in both culture and industry. With all this usage came significant study, particularly with the emergence of organic chemistry. And even with all the known forms and functions of the element, scientists began to uncover the potential for even more varied and extensive carbon structures.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, chemists began to observe complex carbon structures, but they had little evidence to support their concepts, or their work did not make it into the mainstream. Eiji Osawa predicted a spherical form based on observations of a similar structure, but his work was not widely known outside Japan. In a similar manner, the most comprehensive advance was likely computational chemist Elena Galpern's, who in 1973 predicted a highly stable, 60-carbon molecule; her work was also isolated to her native Russia. Still later, Harold Kroto, working with Canadian radio astronomers, sought to uncover the nature of long carbon chains that had been discovered in interstellar space.\n\nKroto sought to use a machine developed by Richard Smalley's team at Rice University to learn more about these structures. Together with Robert Curl, who had introduced them, and three graduate students-James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Yuan Liu-they performed an intensive series of experiments that led to a major discovery.\n\nIn 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard Smalley (Figure 4.12), Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their work in discovering a new form of carbon, the $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$ buckminsterfullerene molecule (Figure 4.1). An entire class of compounds, including spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$. This type of molecule, called a fullerene, shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and shape, fullerenes can encapsulate other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from hydrogen storage to targeted drug delivery systems. They also possess unique electronic and optical properties that have been put to good use in solar powered devices and chemical sensors.",

In 1858, the German chemist August Kekulé and the Scottish chemist Archibald Couper independently proposed that, in all organic compounds, carbon is tetravalent-it always forms four bonds when it joins other elements to form stable compounds. Furthermore, said Kekulé, carbon atoms can bond to one another to form extended chains of linked atoms. In 1865, Kekulé provided another major advance when he suggested that carbon chains can double back on themselves to form rings of atoms.\n\nAlthough Kekule and Couper were correct in describing the tetravalent nature of carbon, chemistry was still viewed in a two-dimensional way until 1874. In that year, the Dutch chemist Jacobus van't Hoff and French chemist Joseph Le Bel added a third dimension to our ideas about organic compounds when they proposed that the four bonds of carbon are not oriented randomly but have specific spatial directions. Van't Hoff went even further and suggested that the four atoms to which carbon is bonded sit at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, with carbon in the center.\n\nA representation of a tetrahedral carbon atom is shown in FIGURE 1.7.

These very different properties stem from the different arrangements of the carbon atoms in the different allotropes.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.43 Diamond is extremely hard because of the strong bonding between carbon atoms in all directions.

Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 4.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities.

London dispersion forces hold the layers together. To learn more, see the discussion of these weak forces in the chapter on liquids and solids.

The loosely held electrons in the resonating $\\pi$ bonds can move throughout the solid and are responsible for the electrical conductivity of graphite.\n\nOther forms of elemental carbon include carbon black, charcoal, and coke.

However, there are several practical ways to define the radius of atoms and, thus, to determine their relative sizes that give roughly similar values. We will use the covalent radius (Figure 3.30), which is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond (this measurement is possible because atoms within molecules still retain much of their atomic identity). We know that as we scan down a group, the principal quantum number, $n$, increases by one for each element. Thus, the electrons are being added to a region of space that is increasingly distant from the nucleus. Consequently, the size of the atom (and its covalent radius) must increase as we increase the distance of the outermost electrons from the nucleus. This trend is illustrated for the covalent radii of the halogens in Table 3.2 and Figure 3.30. The trends for the entire periodic table can be seen in Figure 3.30.\n\nCovalent Radii of the Halogen Group Elements\n\n| Atom | Covalent radius (pm) | Nuclear charge |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| F | 64 | +9 |\n| Cl | 99 | +17 |\n| Br | 114 | +35 |\n| I | 133 | +53 |\n| At | 148 | +85 |\n\nTABLE 3.2\n\n\nFIGURE 3.30 (a) The radius of an atom is defined as one-half the distance between the nuclei in a molecule consisting of two identical atoms joined by a covalent bond.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

Unit Cells of Metals - \nThe structure of a crystalline solid, whether a metal or not, is best described by considering its simplest repeating unit, which is referred to as its unit cell. The unit cell consists of lattice points that represent the locations of atoms or ions. The entire structure then consists of this unit cell repeating in three dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 10.46.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.46 A unit cell shows the locations of lattice points repeating in all directions.\nLet us begin our investigation of crystal lattice structure and unit cells with the most straightforward structure and the most basic unit cell. To visualize this, imagine taking a large number of identical spheres, such as tennis balls, and arranging them uniformly in a container. The simplest way to do this would be to make layers in which the spheres in one layer are directly above those in the layer below, as illustrated in Figure 10.47. This arrangement is called simple cubic structure, and the unit cell is called the simple cubic unit cell or primitive cubic unit cell.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.47 When metal atoms are arranged with spheres in one layer directly above or below spheres in another layer, the lattice structure is called simple cubic. Note that the spheres are in contact.\n\nIn a simple cubic structure, the spheres are not packed as closely as they could be, and they only \"fill\" about $52 \\%$ of the volume of the container. This is a relatively inefficient arrangement, and only one metal (polonium, Po) crystallizes in a simple cubic structure. As shown in Figure 10.48, a solid with this type of arrangement consists of planes (or layers) in which each atom contacts only the four nearest neighbors in its layer; one atom directly above it in the layer above; and one atom directly below it in the layer below. The number of other particles that each particle in a crystalline solid contacts is known as its coordination number. For a polonium atom in a simple cubic array, the coordination number is, therefore, six.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.48 An atom in a simple cubic lattice structure contacts six other atoms, so it has a coordination number of six.",

For example, the hydrogen molecule, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, contains a covalent bond between its two hydrogen atoms. Figure 4.4 illustrates why this bond is formed. Starting on the far right, we have two separate hydrogen atoms with a particular potential energy, indicated by the red line. Along the $x$-axis is the distance between the two atoms. As the two atoms approach each other (moving left along the $x$-axis), their valence orbitals (1s) begin to overlap. The single electrons on each hydrogen atom then interact with both atomic nuclei, occupying the space around both atoms. The strong attraction of each shared electron to both nuclei stabilizes the system, and the potential energy decreases as the bond distance decreases. If the atoms continue to approach each other, the positive charges in the two nuclei begin to repel each other, and the potential energy increases. The bond length is determined by the distance at which the lowest potential energy is achieved.\n\n\nFIGURE 4.4 The potential energy of two separate hydrogen atoms (right) decreases as they approach each other, and the single electrons on each atom are shared to form a covalent bond.

Boron and Silicon Halides - \nThe contrast in structure and physical properties between silicon dioxide and carbon dioxide is interesting, as illustrated in Figure 18.18. Solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) contains single $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules with each of the two oxygen atoms attached to the carbon atom by double bonds. Very weak intermolecular forces hold the molecules together in the crystal. The volatility of dry ice reflect these weak forces between molecules. In contrast, silicon dioxide is a covalent network solid. In silicon dioxide, each silicon atom links to four oxygen atoms by single bonds directed toward the corners of a regular tetrahedron, and $\\mathrm{SiO}_{4}$ tetrahedra share oxygen atoms. This arrangement gives a three dimensional, continuous, silicon-oxygen network. A quartz crystal is a macromolecule of silicon dioxide. The difference between these two compounds is the ability of the group 14 elements to form strong $\\pi$ bonds. Second-period elements, such as carbon, form very strong $\\pi$ bonds, which is why carbon dioxide forms small molecules with strong double bonds. Elements below the second period, such as silicon, do not form $\\pi$ bonds as readily as second-period elements, and when they do form, the $\\pi$ bonds are weaker than those formed by second-period elements. For this reason, silicon dioxide does not contain $\\pi$ bonds but only $\\sigma$ bonds.\n\n\nFIGURE 18.18 Because carbon tends to form double and triple bonds and silicon does not, (a) carbon dioxide is a discrete molecule with two $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bonds and (b) silicon dioxide is an infinite network of oxygen atoms bridging between silicon atoms with each silicon atom possessing four $\\mathrm{Si}-\\mathrm{O}$ single bonds.

This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.\n\nThere currently are no commercial applications of graphene.

Look at methane, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, the main constituent of natural gas, for example. The bonding in methane is not ionic because it would take too much energy for carbon ( $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}$ ) either to gain or lose four electrons to achieve a noble-gas configuration. Instead, carbon bonds to other atoms, not by gaining or losing electrons, but by sharing them. Such a sharedelectron bond, first proposed in 1916 by the American chemist G. N. Lewis, is called a covalent bond. The neutral collection of atoms held together by covalent bonds is called a molecule. Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, however, are not called molecules.\n\nA simple way of indicating the covalent bonds in molecules is to use what are called Lewis structures, or electron-dot structures, in which the valence-shell electrons of an atom are represented as dots. Thus, hydrogen has one dot representing its $1 s$ electron, carbon has four dots ( $2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}$ ), oxygen has six dots ( $2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$ ), and so on. A stable molecule results whenever a noble-gas configuration of eight dots (an octet) is achieved for all main-group atoms or two dots for hydrogen. Even simpler than Lewis structures is the use of Kekulé structures, or line-bond structures, in which the two-electron covalent bonds are indicated as lines drawn between atoms.",

This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the octet rule.\n\nThe number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table ( $\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{O}$, and F ). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet.

Two models have been developed to describe covalent bonding: valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and chemists tend to use them interchangeably depending on the circumstances. Valence bond theory is the more easily visualized of the two, so most of the descriptions we'll use in this book derive from that approach.\n\nAccording to valence bond (VB) theory, a covalent bond forms when two atoms approach each other closely and a singly occupied orbital on one atom overlaps a singly occupied orbital on the other atom. The electrons are now paired in the overlapping orbitals and are attracted to the nuclei of both atoms, thus bonding the atoms together. In the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule, for instance, the $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond results from the overlap of two singly occupied hydrogen $1 s$ orbitals.\n\n\nThe overlapping orbitals in the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule have the elongated egg shape we might get by pressing two spheres together.

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

The Interdependence between Ocean Depth and Pressure in Scuba Diving - \nPressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface. The pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air). Most pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as \"atmospheres absolute\" or ATA in the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA of pressure from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body's air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in their BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle's law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and they begin to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at the surface.",

They are being threatened by climate change, oceanic acidification, and water pollution, all of which change the composition of the solution known as seawater. Dissolved oxygen in seawater is critical for sea creatures, but as the oceans warm, oxygen becomes less soluble. As the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the oceans increases, contributing to oceanic acidification. Coral reefs are particularly sensitive to the acidification of the ocean, since the exoskeletons of the coral polyps are soluble in acidic solutions. Humans contribute to the changing of seawater composition by allowing agricultural runoff and other forms of pollution to affect our oceans.\n\nSolutions are crucial to the processes that sustain life and to many other processes involving chemical reactions. This chapter considers the nature of solutions and examines factors that determine whether a solution will form and what properties it may have. The properties of colloids-mixtures containing dispersed particles larger than the molecules and ions of typical solutions-are also discussed.",

Decompression Sickness or \"The Bends\" - \nDecompression sickness (DCS), or \"the bends,\" is an effect of the increased pressure of the air inhaled by scuba divers when swimming underwater at considerable depths. In addition to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere, divers are subjected to additional pressure due to the water above them, experiencing an increase of approximately 1 atm for each 10 m of depth. Therefore, the air inhaled by a diver while submerged contains gases at the corresponding higher ambient pressure, and the concentrations of the gases dissolved in the diver's blood are proportionally higher per Henry's law.\n\nAs the diver ascends to the surface of the water, the ambient pressure decreases and the dissolved gases becomes less soluble. If the ascent is too rapid, the gases escaping from the diver's blood may form bubbles that can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from rashes and joint pain to paralysis and death. To avoid DCS, divers must ascend from depths at relatively slow speeds ( 10 or $20 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{min}$ ) or otherwise make several decompression stops, pausing for several minutes at given depths during the ascent. When these preventive measures are unsuccessful, divers with DCS are often provided hyperbaric oxygen therapy in pressurized vessels called decompression (or recompression) chambers (Figure 11.11). Researchers are also investigating related body reactions and defenses in order to develop better testing and treatment for decompression sicknetss. For example, Ingrid Eftedal, a barophysiologist specializing in bodily reactions to diving, has shown that white blood cells undergo chemical and genetic changes as a result of the condition; these can potentially be used to create biomarker tests and other methods to manage decompression sickness.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.11 (a) US Navy divers undergo training in a recompression chamber. (b) Divers receive hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\n\nDeviations from Henry's law are observed when a chemical reaction takes place between the gaseous solute and the solvent. Thus, for example, the solubility of ammonia in water increases more rapidly with increasing pressure than predicted by the law because ammonia, being a base, reacts to some extent with water to form ammonium ions and hydroxide ions.",

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.\n\nWaves need not be restricted to travel through matter.

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MHz}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$ and gigahertz $\\left(1 \\mathrm{GHz}=1 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$. The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed.

Amplitude is one-half the height of the wave from peak to trough.\n\nThe product of a wave's wavelength $(\\lambda)$ and its frequency $(\\nu), \\lambda \\nu$, is the speed of the wave.

Gas solubility increases as the pressure of the gas increases. Carbonated beverages provide a nice illustration of this relationship. The carbonation process involves exposing the beverage to a relatively high pressure of carbon dioxide gas and then sealing the beverage container, thus saturating the beverage with $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at this pressure. When the beverage container is opened, a familiar hiss is heard as the carbon dioxide gas pressure is released, and some of the dissolved carbon dioxide is typically seen leaving solution in the form of small bubbles (Figure 11.10). At this point, the beverage is supersaturated with carbon dioxide and, with time, the dissolved carbon dioxide concentration will decrease to its equilibrium value and the beverage will become \"flat.\"\n\n\nFIGURE 11.10 Opening the bottle of carbonated beverage reduces the pressure of the gaseous carbon dioxide above the beverage.

As we shall see, standing waves play an important role in our understanding of the electronic structure of atoms and molecules. The simplest example of a standing wave is a onedimensional wave associated with a vibrating string that is held fixed at its two end points. Figure 3.7 shows the four lowest-energy standing waves (the fundamental wave and the lowest three harmonics) for a vibrating string at a particular amplitude. Although the string's motion lies mostly within a plane, the wave itself is considered to be one dimensional, since it lies along the length of the string. The motion of string segments in a direction perpendicular to the string length generates the waves and so the amplitude of the waves is visible as the maximum displacement of the curves seen in Figure 3.7. The key observation from the figure is that only those waves having an integer number, n, of half-wavelengths between the end points can form. A system with fixed end points such as this restricts the number and type of the possible waveforms. This is an example of quantization, in which only discrete values from a more general set of continuous values of some property are observed. Another important observation is that the harmonic waves (those waves displaying more than one-half wavelength) all have one or more points between the two end points that are not in motion. These special points are nodes. The energies of the standing waves with a given amplitude in a vibrating string increase with the number of half-wavelengths $n$. Since the number of nodes is $n-1$, the energy can also be said to depend on the number of nodes, generally increasing as the number of nodes increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.7 A vibrating string shows some one-dimensional standing waves. Since the two end points of the string are held fixed, only waves having an integer number of half-wavelengths can form.

At sea level, this pressure is roughly the same as that exerted by a full-grown African elephant standing on a doormat, or a typical bowling ball resting on your thumbnail. These may seem like huge amounts, and they are, but life on earth has evolved under such atmospheric pressure. If you actually perch a bowling ball on your thumbnail, the pressure experienced is twice the usual pressure, and the sensation is unpleasant.\n\nIn general, pressure is defined as the force exerted on a given area: $P=\\frac{F}{A}$. Note that pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to area. Thus, pressure can be increased either by increasing the amount of force or by decreasing the area over which it is applied; pressure can be decreased by decreasing the force or increasing the area.\n\nLet's apply this concept to determine which exerts a greater pressure in Figure 8.3-the elephant or the figure skater?

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms).

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill - \nThe blowout of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig on April 20, 2010, in the Gulf of Mexico near Mississippi began the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. In the 87 days following the blowout, an estimated 4.9 million barrels ( 210 million gallons) of oil flowed from the ruptured well 5000 feet below the water's surface. The well was finally declared sealed on September 19, 2010.\n\nCrude oil is immiscible with and less dense than water, so the spilled oil rose to the surface of the water.\n\nFloating booms, skimmer ships, and controlled burns were used to remove oil from the water's surface in an attempt to protect beaches and wetlands along the Gulf coast. In addition to removal of the oil, attempts were also made to lessen its environmental impact by rendering it \"soluble\" (in the loose sense of the term) and thus allowing it to be diluted to hopefully less harmful levels by the vast volume of ocean water. This approach used 1.84 million gallons of the oil dispersant Corexit 9527, most of which was injected underwater at the site of the leak, with small amounts being sprayed on top of the spill. Corexit 9527 contains 2-butoxyethanol $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14} \\mathrm{O}_{2}\\right)$, an amphiphilic molecule whose polar and nonpolar ends are useful for emulsifying oil into small droplets, increasing the surface area of the oil and making it more available to marine bacteria for digestion (Figure 11.34). While this approach avoids many of the immediate hazards that bulk oil poses to marine and coastal ecosystems, it introduces the possibility of long-term effects resulting from the introduction of the complex and potential toxic components of petroleum into the ocean's food chain. A number of organizations are involved in monitoring the extended impact of this oil spill, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/16gulfspill) for additional details).",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

In the seventeenth century, Isaac Newton performed experiments with lenses and prisms and was able to demonstrate that white light consists of the individual colors of the rainbow combined together. Newton explained his optics findings in terms of a \"corpuscular\" view of light, in which light was composed of streams of extremely tiny particles travelling at high speeds according to Newton's laws of motion. Others in the seventeenth century, such as Christiaan Huygens, had shown that optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction could be equally well explained in terms of light as waves travelling at high speed through a medium called \"luminiferous aether\" that was thought to permeate all space. Early in the nineteenth century, Thomas Young demonstrated that light passing through narrow, closely spaced slits produced interference patterns that could not be explained in terms of Newtonian particles but could be easily explained in terms of waves. Later in the nineteenth century, after James Clerk Maxwell developed his theory of electromagnetic radiation and showed that light was the visible part of a vast spectrum of electromagnetic waves, the particle view of light became thoroughly discredited. By the end of the nineteenth century, scientists viewed the physical universe as roughly comprising two separate domains: matter composed of particles moving according to Newton's laws of motion, and electromagnetic radiation consisting of waves governed by Maxwell's equations. Today, these domains are referred to as classical mechanics and classical electrodynamics (or classical electromagnetism). Although there were a few physical phenomena that could not be explained within this framework, scientists at that time were so confident of the overall soundness of this framework that they viewed these aberrations as puzzling paradoxes that would ultimately be resolved somehow within this framework. As we shall see, these paradoxes led to a contemporary framework that intimately connects particles and waves at a fundamental level called waveparticle duality, which has superseded the classical view.",

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low. As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {methanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ethanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {propanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {butanol }}$.\n\nAs temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, $K E$, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase.",

At room temperature, for example, the reaction is so slow that if we prepared a mixture of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, no detectable amount of ammonia would form during our lifetime.

If we lower the temperature to shift the equilibrium to favor the formation of more ammonia, equilibrium is reached more slowly because of the large decrease of reaction rate with decreasing temperature.\n\nPart of the rate of formation lost by operating at lower temperatures can be recovered by using a catalyst.

The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton's Law - \nUnless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other's pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container (Figure 8.20). The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its partial pressure. This observation is summarized by Dalton's law of partial pressures: The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases:\n\n$$\nP_{\\text {Total }}=P_{A}+P_{B}+P_{C}+\\ldots=\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{i}} P_{\\mathrm{i}}\n$$\n\nIn the equation $P_{\\text {Total }}$ is the total pressure of a mixture of gases, $P_{A}$ is the partial pressure of gas $A ; P_{B}$ is the partial pressure of gas $B ; P_{C}$ is the partial pressure of gas $C$; and so on.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.20 If equal-volume cylinders containing gasses at pressures of $300 \\mathrm{kPa}, 450 \\mathrm{kPa}$, and 600 kPa are all combined in the same-size cylinder, the total pressure of the gas mixture is 1350 kPa .\n\nThe partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its mole fraction ( $\\boldsymbol{X}$ ), a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:\n\n$$\nP_{A}=X_{A} \\times P_{\\text {Total }} \\quad \\text { where } \\quad X_{A}=\\frac{n_{A}}{n_{\\text {Total }}}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{A}, X_{A}$, and $n_{A}$ are the partial pressure, mole fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and $n_{\\text {Total }}$ is the number of moles of all components in the mixture.",

Avogadro's Law Revisited - \nSometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure.\n\nWe can extend Avogadro's law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to $\\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$, a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.\n\nThe explanation for this is illustrated in Figure 8.23. According to Avogadro's law, equal volumes of gaseous $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ reacts with three molecules of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to produce two molecules of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, the volume of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ required is three times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, and the volume of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ produced is two times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.23 One volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ combines with three volumes of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to form two volumes of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.",

There are four possibilities.\n\n- One possibility is that the protons are chemically unrelated and thus nonequivalent. If so, the products formed on substitution of H by X would be different constitutional isomers. In butane, for instance, the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons are different from the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - protons. They therefore give different products on substitution by X than the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ protons and would likely show different NMR absorptions.\n\n\n\nThe $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - and $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ hydrogens are unrelated and have different NMR absorptions.\n\n\nThe two substitution products are constitutional isomers.\n\n- A second possibility is that the protons are chemically identical and thus electronically equivalent. If so, the same product would be formed regardless of which H is substituted by X . In butane, for instance, the six $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ hydrogens on C 1 and C 4 are identical, would give the identical structure on substitution by X , and would show an identical NMR absorption. Such protons are said to be homotopic.",

The spins of nonequivalent aromatic protons on substituted rings often couple with each other, giving rise to spin-spin splitting patterns that can identify the substitution of the ring.\n\nMuch of the difference in chemical shift between aromatic protons (6.5-8.0 $\\delta$ ) and vinylic protons (4.5-6.5 $\\delta$ ) is due to a property of aromatic rings called ring-current. When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized $\\pi$ electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.\nNote that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring.

Coupling with the C3 proton splits the signal of the C2 proton in trans-cinnamaldehyde into a doublet with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.

For HF, there is a larger dipole moment because there is a larger difference in electronegativity.\n\nWhen a molecule contains more than one bond, the geometry must be taken into account. If the bonds in a molecule are arranged such that their bond moments cancel (vector sum equals zero), then the molecule is nonpolar. This is the situation in $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Figure 4.27). Each of the bonds is polar, but the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. From the Lewis structure, and using VSEPR theory, we determine that the $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecule is linear with polar $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ bonds on opposite sides of the carbon atom. The bond moments cancel because they are pointed in opposite directions. In the case of the water molecule (Figure 4.27), the Lewis structure again shows that there are two bonds to a central atom, and the electronegativity difference again shows that each of these bonds has a nonzero bond moment. In this case, however, the molecular structure is bent because of the lone pairs on O , and the two bond moments do not cancel. Therefore, water does have a net dipole moment and is a polar molecule (dipole).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.27 The overall dipole moment of a molecule depends on the individual bond dipole moments and how they are arranged. (a) Each CO bond has a bond dipole moment, but they point in opposite directions so that the net $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecule is nonpolar. (b) In contrast, water is polar because the OH bond moments do not cancel out.\n\nThe OCS molecule has a structure similar to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but a sulfur atom has replaced one of the oxygen atoms. To determine if this molecule is polar, we draw the molecular structure. VSEPR theory predicts a linear molecule:",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

The unique properties of carbon atoms allow the existence of carbon-based life forms such as ourselves. Carbon forms a huge variety of substances that we use on a daily basis, including those shown in Figure 10.43. You may be familiar with diamond and graphite, the two most common allotropes of carbon. (Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element.) Diamond is one of the hardest-known substances, whereas graphite is soft enough to be used as pencil lead. These very different properties stem from the different arrangements of the carbon atoms in the different allotropes.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.43 Diamond is extremely hard because of the strong bonding between carbon atoms in all directions. Graphite (in pencil lead) rubs off onto paper due to the weak attractions between the carbon layers. An image of a graphite surface shows the distance between the centers of adjacent carbon atoms.

As in graphite, the carbon atoms form a layer of six-membered rings with $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms at the corners. Resonance stabilizes the system and leads to its conductivity. Unlike graphite, there is no stacking of the layers to give a three-dimensional structure. Andre Geim and Kostya Novoselov at the University of Manchester won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering work characterizing graphene.\n\nThe simplest procedure for preparing graphene is to use a piece of adhesive tape to remove a single layer of graphene from the surface of a piece of graphite. This method works because there are only weak London dispersion forces between the layers in graphite. Alternative methods are to deposit a single layer of carbon atoms on the surface of some other material (ruthenium, iridium, or copper) or to synthesize it at the surface of silicon carbide via the sublimation of silicon.\n\nThere currently are no commercial applications of graphene. However, its unusual properties, such as high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, should make it suitable for the manufacture of many advanced electronic devices and for thermal management applications.\n\nCarbon nanotubes are carbon allotropes, which have a cylindrical structure. Like graphite and graphene, nanotubes consist of rings of $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Unlike graphite and graphene, which occur in layers, the layers wrap into a tube and bond together to produce a stable structure.

In pure covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally. In polar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared unequally, as one atom exerts a stronger force of attraction on the electrons than the other. The ability of an atom to attract a pair of electrons in a chemical bond is called its electronegativity. The difference in electronegativity between two atoms determines how polar a bond will be. In a diatomic molecule with two identical atoms, there is no difference in electronegativity, so the bond is nonpolar or pure covalent.

This lack of resistance means that there is no energy loss during the transmission of electricity. This would lead to a significant reduction in the cost of electricity.\n\nMost currently used, commercial superconducting materials, such as NbTi and $\\mathrm{Nb}_{3} \\mathrm{Sn}$, do not become superconducting until they are cooled below $23 \\mathrm{~K}\\left(-250^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$. This requires the use of liquid helium, which has a boiling temperature of 4 K and is expensive and difficult to handle. The cost of liquid helium has deterred the widespread application of superconductors.\n\nOne of the most exciting scientific discoveries of the 1980s was the characterization of compounds that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above 90 K . (Compared to liquid helium, 90 K is a high temperature.) Typical among the high-temperature superconducting materials are oxides containing yttrium (or one of several rare earth elements), barium, and copper in a 1:2:3 ratio. The formula of the ionic yttrium compound is $\\mathrm{YBa}_{2} \\mathrm{Cu}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{7}$.\n\nThe new materials become superconducting at temperatures close to 90 K (Figure 19.10), temperatures that can be reached by cooling with liquid nitrogen (boiling temperature of 77 K ). Not only are liquid nitrogencooled materials easier to handle, but the cooling costs are also about 1000 times lower than for liquid helium.\n\nFurther advances during the same period included materials that became superconducting at even higher temperatures and with a wider array of materials. The DuPont team led by Uma Chowdry and Arthur Sleight identified Bismouth-Strontium-Copper-Oxides that became superconducting at temperatures as high as 110 K and, importantly, did not contain rare earth elements. Advances continued through the subsequent decades until, in 2020, a team led by Ranga Dias at University of Rochester announced the development of a roomtemperature superconductor, opening doors to widespread applications. More research and development is needed to realize the potential of these materials, but the possibilities are very promising.",

Less commonly, some atoms or ions in a crystal may occupy positions, called interstitial sites, located between the regular positions for atoms. Other distortions are found in impure crystals, as, for example, when the cations, anions, or molecules of the impurity are too large to fit into the regular positions without distorting the structure. Trace amounts of impurities are sometimes added to a crystal (a process known as doping) in order to create defects in the structure that yield desirable changes in its properties. For example, silicon crystals are doped with varying amounts of different elements to yield suitable electrical properties for their use in the manufacture of semiconductors and computer chips.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.45 Types of crystal defects include vacancies, interstitial atoms, and substitutions impurities.",

We can use quantum mechanics to predict the specific regions around an atom where electrons are likely to be located: A spherical shape for an $s$ orbital, a dumbbell shape for a $p$ orbital, and so forth. However, these predictions only describe the orbitals around free atoms. When atoms bond to form molecules, atomic orbitals are not sufficient to describe the regions where electrons will be located in the molecule. A more complete understanding of electron distributions requires a model that can account for the electronic structure of molecules. One popular theory holds that a covalent bond forms when a pair of electrons is shared by two atoms and is simultaneously attracted by the nuclei of both atoms. In the following sections, we will discuss how such bonds are described by valence bond theory and hybridization.\n\nValence bond theory describes a covalent bond as the overlap of half-filled atomic orbitals (each containing a single electron) that yield a pair of electrons shared between the two bonded atoms. We say that orbitals on two different atoms overlap when a portion of one orbital and a portion of a second orbital occupy the same region of space. According to valence bond theory, a covalent bond results when two conditions are met: (1) an orbital on one atom overlaps an orbital on a second atom and (2) the single electrons in each orbital combine to form an electron pair. The mutual attraction between this negatively charged electron pair and the two atoms' positively charged nuclei serves to physically link the two atoms through a force we define as a covalent bond. The strength of a covalent bond depends on the extent of overlap of the orbitals involved. Orbitals that overlap extensively form bonds that are stronger than those that have less overlap.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

Bond Strength: Covalent Bonds - \nTABLE 9.4\n\nThe bond energy is the difference between the energy minimum (which occurs at the bond distance) and the energy of the two separated atoms.

This important reaction class is defined by changes in oxidation states for one or more reactant elements, and it includes a subset of reactions involving the transfer of electrons between reactant species. Around the turn of the nineteenth century, chemists began exploring ways these electrons could be transferred indirectly via an external circuit rather than directly via intimate contact of redox reactants. In the two centuries since, the field of electrochemistry has evolved to yield significant insights on the fundamental aspects of redox chemistry as well as a wealth of technologies ranging from industrial-scale metallurgical processes to robust, rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (Figure 16.1). In this chapter, the essential concepts of electrochemistry will be addressed.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe other three quantum numbers, $n, l$, and $m_{l}$, are properties of specific atomic orbitals that also define in what part of the space an electron is most likely to be located. Orbitals are a result of solving the Schrödinger equation for electrons in atoms. The electron spin is a different kind of property. It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states. One is termed the $\\alpha$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being in the positive direction of the $z$ axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$. The other is called the $\\beta$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being negative and $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. Any electron, regardless of the atomic orbital it is located in, can only have one of those two values of the spin quantum number.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

All RNA molecules are much smaller than DNA, and all remain single-stranded rather than double-stranded.\n\n- Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic messages from DNA to ribosomes, small granular particles in the cytoplasm of a cell where protein synthesis takes place.\n- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) complexed with protein provides the physical makeup of the ribosomes.\n- Transfer RNA (tRNA) transports amino acids to the ribosomes, where they are joined together to make proteins.\n- Small RNAs, also called functional RNAs, have a variety of functions within the cell, including silencing transcription and catalyzing chemical modifications of other RNA molecules.\n\nThe genetic information in DNA is contained in segments called genes, each of which consists of a specific nucleotide sequence that encodes a specific protein. The conversion of that information from DNA into proteins begins in the nucleus of cells with the synthesis of mRNA by transcription of DNA. In bacteria, the process begins when RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to a promoter sequence on DNA, typically consisting of around 40 base pairs located upstream ( 5 ') of the transcription start site. Within the promoter are two hexameric consensus sequences, one located 10 base pairs upstream of the start and the second located 35 base pairs upstream.\n\nFollowing formation of the polymerase-promoter complex, several turns of the DNA double helix untwist, forming a bubble and exposing 14 or so base pairs of the two strands. Appropriate ribonucleotides then line up by hydrogen-bonding to their complementary bases on DNA, bond formation occurs in the $5^{\\prime} \\rightarrow 3^{\\prime}$ direction, the RNA polymerase moves along the DNA chain, and the growing RNA molecule unwinds from DNA (FIGURE 28.6).

Hydrogen bonds are broken, the two strands separate to form a \"bubble,\" and bases are exposed. New nucleotides then line up on each strand in a complementary manner, A to T and G to C , and two new strands begin to grow from the ends of the bubble, called the replication forks. Each new strand is complementary to its old template strand, so two identical DNA double helices are produced (FIGURE 28.5). Because each of the new DNA molecules contains one old strand and one new strand, the process is described as semiconservative replication.\n\n\nFIGURE 28.5 A representation of semiconservative DNA replication.

Activation Energy and the Arrhenius Equation - \n$$\nk=A e^{-E_{\\mathrm{a}} / R T}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, which has a value $8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{T}$ is temperature on the Kelvin scale, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation energy in joules per mole, $e$ is the constant 2.7183 , and $A$ is a constant called the frequency factor, which is related to the frequency of collisions and the orientation of the reacting molecules.\n\nPostulates of collision theory are nicely accommodated by the Arrhenius equation. The frequency factor, $A$, reflects how well the reaction conditions favor properly oriented collisions between reactant molecules. An increased probability of effectively oriented collisions results in larger values for $A$ and faster reaction rates.\nThe exponential term, $e^{-E a / R T}$, describes the effect of activation energy on reaction rate. According to kinetic molecular theory (see chapter on gases), the temperature of matter is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its constituent atoms or molecules. The distribution of energies among the molecules composing a sample of matter at any given temperature is described by the plot shown in Figure 17.15(a). Two shaded areas under the curve represent the numbers of molecules possessing adequate energy $(R T)$ to overcome the activation barriers $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$. A lower activation energy results in a greater fraction of adequately energized molecules and a faster reaction.\n\nThe exponential term also describes the effect of temperature on reaction rate. A higher temperature represents a correspondingly greater fraction of molecules possessing sufficient energy ( $R T$ ) to overcome the activation barrier $\\left(E_{a}\\right)$, as shown in Figure $17.15(\\mathbf{b})$. This yields a greater value for the rate constant and a correspondingly faster reaction rate.\n\n\nFIGURE 17.15 Molecular energy distributions showing numbers of molecules with energies exceeding (a) two different activation energies at a given temperature, and (b) a given activation energy at two different temperatures.\n\nA convenient approach for determining $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ for a reaction involves the measurement of $k$ at two or more different temperatures and using an alternate version of the Arrhenius equation that takes the form of a linear equation",

The heat from the sun's rays is critical to the lizard's survival. A warm lizard can move faster than a cold one because the chemical reactions that allow its muscles to move occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. A cold lizard is a slower lizard and an easier meal for predators.\n\nFrom baking a cake to determining the useful lifespan of a bridge, rates of chemical reactions play important roles in our understanding of processes that involve chemical changes. Two questions are typically posed when planning to carry out a chemical reaction. The first is: \"Will the reaction produce the desired products in useful quantities?\" The second question is: \"How rapidly will the reaction occur?\" A third question is often asked when investigating reactions in greater detail: \"What specific molecular-level processes take place as the reaction occurs?\" Knowing the answer to this question is of practical importance when the yield or rate of a reaction needs to be controlled.\n\nThe study of chemical kinetics concerns the second and third questions-that is, the rate at which a reaction yields products and the molecular-scale means by which a reaction occurs. This chapter examines the factors\nthat influence the rates of chemical reactions, the mechanisms by which reactions proceed, and the quantitative techniques used to describe the rates at which reactions occur.",

The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton's Law - \nUnless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other's pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container (Figure 8.20).

Placing methanol and ethanol, or pentane and hexane, in the bulbs shown in Figure 11.3 will result in the same diffusion and subsequent mixing of these liquids as is observed for the He and Ar gases (although at a much slower rate), yielding solutions with no significant change in energy. Unlike a mixture of gases, however, the components of these liquid-liquid solutions do, indeed, experience intermolecular attractive forces. But since the molecules of the two substances being mixed are structurally very similar, the intermolecular attractive forces between like and unlike molecules are essentially the same, and the dissolution process, therefore, does not entail any appreciable increase or decrease in energy. These examples illustrate how increased matter dispersal alone can provide the driving force required to cause the spontaneous formation of a solution. In some cases, however, the relative magnitudes of intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species may prevent dissolution.\n\nThree types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process: solute-solute, solventsolvent, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in Figure 11.4, the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process in which energy is consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic process referred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater than the energy released by solvation.",

They are incompressible and have similar densities that are both much larger than those of gases. They are different in that liquids have no fixed shape, and solids are rigid.\n2. They are similar in that the atoms or molecules are free to move from one position to another. They differ in that the particles of a liquid are confined to the shape of the vessel in which they are placed. In contrast,\na gas will expand without limit to fill the space into which it is placed.\n3. All atoms and molecules will condense into a liquid or solid in which the attractive forces exceed the kinetic energy of the molecules, at sufficiently low temperature.\n4. (a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. The electrostatic attraction between the partially positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partially negative atom in another molecule gives rise to a strong dipole-dipole interaction called a hydrogen bond (e.g., HF...HF ).\n5.

The Solubility Product - \nRecall from the chapter on solutions that the solubility of a substance can vary from essentially zero (insoluble or sparingly soluble) to infinity (miscible). A solute with finite solubility can yield a saturated solution when it is added to a solvent in an amount exceeding its solubility, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of the saturated solution and the excess, undissolved solute. For example, a saturated solution of silver chloride is one in which the equilibrium shown below has been established.\n\nIn this solution, an excess of solid AgCl dissolves and dissociates to produce aqueous $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions at the same rate that these aqueous ions combine and precipitate to form solid AgCl (Figure 15.2).

Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\n\nThe properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of $1+$. Their\nreactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal $\\left(0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right)$.\n\nThe alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is:\n\n\nFIGURE 18.3 Lithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil.\nAlkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds containing $1+$ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture and oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure 18.4 , to prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to their high reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal compounds.",

However, there are applications where the reactivity of the alkali metals is an advantage.

Streetlights sometime employ sodium vapor lights because the sodium vapor penetrates fog better than most other light. This is because the fog does not scatter yellow light as much as it scatters white light. The other alkali metals and their salts also impart color to a flame. Lithium creates a bright, crimson color, whereas the others create a pale, violet color.\n\n\nFIGURE 18.5 Dipping a wire into a solution of a sodium salt and then heating the wire causes emission of a bright yellow light, characteristic of sodium.",

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

Electronegativity, on the other hand, describes how tightly an atom attracts electrons in a bond. It is a dimensionless quantity that is calculated, not measured.

Dispersion Forces - \nOne of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron's location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species-a so-called dispersion force like that illustrated in Figure 10.6.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.6 Dispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar diatomic molecules.\n\nDispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each other.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

Microscopic\nobjects (such as electrons) have properties of both a particle and a wave. Their exact trajectories cannot be determined. The quantum mechanical model of atoms describes the three-dimensional position of the electron in a probabilistic manner according to a mathematical function called a wavefunction, often denoted as $\\psi$. Atomic wavefunctions are also called orbitals. The squared magnitude of the wavefunction describes the distribution of the probability of finding the electron in a particular region in space. Therefore, atomic orbitals describe the areas in an atom where electrons are most likely to be found.\n\nAn atomic orbital is characterized by three quantum numbers. The principal quantum number, $n$, can be any positive integer. The general region for value of energy of the orbital and the average distance of an electron from the nucleus are related to $n$. Orbitals having the same value of $n$ are said to be in the same shell. The secondary (angular momentum) quantum number, $l$, can have any integer value from 0 to $n-1$. This quantum number describes the shape or type of the orbital. Orbitals with the same principal quantum number and the same $l$ value belong to the same subshell. The magnetic quantum number, $m_{l}$, with $2 l+1$ values ranging from $-l$ to $+l$, describes the orientation of the orbital in space. In addition, each electron has a spin quantum number, $m_{s}$, that can be equal to $\\pm \\frac{1}{2}$. No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of values for all the four quantum numbers.",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schrödinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states.

X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal.

Nevertheless, wouldn't it be nice if you could simply look at a molecule and \"see\" its structure with your eyes?\n\nDetermining the three-dimensional shape of an object around you is easy-you just look at it, let your eyes focus the light rays reflected from the object, and let your brain assemble the data into a recognizable image. If the object is small, you use a microscope and let the microscope lens focus the visible light. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what you can see, even with the best optical microscope. Called the diffraction limit, you can't see anything smaller than the wavelength of light you are using for the observation. Visible light has wavelengths of several hundred nanometers, but atoms in molecules have dimensions on the order of 0.1 nm . Thus, to see a molecule-whether a small one in the laboratory or a large, complex enzyme with a molecular weight in the tens of thousands-you need wavelengths in the 0.1 nm range, which corresponds to X rays.\n\nLet's say that we want to determine the structure and shape of an enzyme or other biological molecule. The technique used is called X-ray crystallography. First, the molecule is crystallized (which often turns out to be the most difficult and time-consuming part of the entire process) and a small crystal of 0.4 to 0.5 mm on its longest axis is glued to the end of a glass fiber. The fiber and attached crystal are then mounted in an instrument called an X-ray diffractometer, which consists of a radiation source, a sample positioning and orienting device that can rotate the crystal in any direction, a detector, and a controlling computer.\n\nOnce mounted in the diffractometer, the crystal is irradiated with X rays, usually so-called $\\mathrm{Cu} K_{\\alpha}$ radiation with a wavelength of 0.154 nm . When the X rays strike the enzyme crystal, they interact with electrons in the molecule and are scattered into a diffraction pattern which, when detected and visualized, appears as a series of intense spots against a null background.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

Dispersion Forces - \nOne of the three van der Waals forces is present in all condensed phases, regardless of the nature of the atoms or molecules composing the substance. This attractive force is called the London dispersion force in honor of German-born American physicist Fritz London who, in 1928, first explained it. This force is often referred to as simply the dispersion force. Because the electrons of an atom or molecule are in constant motion (or, alternatively, the electron's location is subject to quantum-mechanical variability), at any moment in time, an atom or molecule can develop a temporary, instantaneous dipole if its electrons are distributed asymmetrically. The presence of this dipole can, in turn, distort the electrons of a neighboring atom or molecule, producing an induced dipole. These two rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles thus result in a relatively weak electrostatic attraction between the species-a so-called dispersion force like that illustrated in Figure 10.6.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.6 Dispersion forces result from the formation of temporary dipoles, as illustrated here for two nonpolar diatomic molecules.\n\nDispersion forces that develop between atoms in different molecules can attract the two molecules to each other.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The properties of the different kinds of crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them. Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures.

Are they the smallest particles, or is there something smaller? In the late 1800 s , a number of scientists interested in questions like these investigated the electrical discharges that could be produced in low-pressure gases, with the most significant discovery made by English physicist J. J. Thomson using a cathode ray tube. This apparatus consisted of a sealed glass tube from which almost all the air had been removed; the tube contained two metal electrodes. When high voltage was applied across the electrodes, a visible beam called a cathode ray appeared between them. This beam was deflected toward the positive charge and away from the negative charge, and was produced in the same way with identical properties when different metals were used for the electrodes. In similar experiments, the ray was simultaneously deflected by an applied magnetic field, and measurements of the extent of deflection and the magnetic field strength allowed Thomson to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the cathode ray particles. The results of these measurements indicated that these particles were much lighter than atoms (Figure 2.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 2.6 (a) J. J. Thomson produced a visible beam in a cathode ray tube. (b) This is an early cathode ray tube, invented in 1897 by Ferdinand Braun. (c) In the cathode ray, the beam (shown in yellow) comes from the cathode and is accelerated past the anode toward a fluorescent scale at the end of the tube. Simultaneous deflections by applied electric and magnetic fields permitted Thomson to calculate the mass-to-charge ratio of the particles composing the cathode ray.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments).

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

Look at methane, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, the main constituent of natural gas, for example. The bonding in methane is not ionic because it would take too much energy for carbon ( $1 s^{2} 2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}$ ) either to gain or lose four electrons to achieve a noble-gas configuration. Instead, carbon bonds to other atoms, not by gaining or losing electrons, but by sharing them. Such a sharedelectron bond, first proposed in 1916 by the American chemist G. N. Lewis, is called a covalent bond. The neutral collection of atoms held together by covalent bonds is called a molecule. Ionic compounds such as sodium chloride, however, are not called molecules.\n\nA simple way of indicating the covalent bonds in molecules is to use what are called Lewis structures, or electron-dot structures, in which the valence-shell electrons of an atom are represented as dots. Thus, hydrogen has one dot representing its $1 s$ electron, carbon has four dots ( $2 s^{2} 2 p^{2}$ ), oxygen has six dots ( $2 s^{2} 2 p^{4}$ ), and so on. A stable molecule results whenever a noble-gas configuration of eight dots (an octet) is achieved for all main-group atoms or two dots for hydrogen.

The Octet Rule - \nThe other halogen molecules ( $\\mathrm{F}_{2}, \\mathrm{Br}_{2}, \\mathrm{I}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{At}_{2}$ ) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the octet rule.\n\nThe number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table ( $\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{O}$, and F ). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in $\\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in $\\mathrm{SiH}_{4}$ (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:\n\n\nGroup 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons.

You might recall from your general chemistry course that, according to the quantum mechanical model, the behavior of a specific electron in an atom can be described by a mathematical expression called a wave equation-the same type of expression used to describe the motion of waves in a fluid. The solution to a wave equation is called a wave function, or orbital, and is denoted by the lowercase Greek letter psi ( $\\psi$ ).\nWhen the square of the wave function, $\\psi^{2}$, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been. This electron cloud doesn't have a sharp boundary, but for practical purposes we can set the limits by saying that an orbital represents the space where an electron spends $90 \\%$ to $95 \\%$ of its time.\n\nWhat do orbitals look like? There are four different kinds of orbitals, denoted $s, p, d$, and $f$, each with a different shape. Of the four, we'll be concerned primarily with $s$ and $p$ orbitals because these are the most common in\norganic and biological chemistry. An $s$ orbital has a spherical shape, with the nucleus at its center; a $p$ orbital has a dumbbell shape with two parts, or lobes; and four of the five $d$ orbitals have a cloverleaf shape with four lobes, as shown in FIGURE 1.4. The fifth $d$ orbital is shaped like an elongated dumbbell with a doughnut around its middle.\n\n\nAn $s$ orbital\n\n\nA p orbital\n\n\nAd orbital\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Representations of $\\boldsymbol{s}, \\boldsymbol{p}$, and $\\boldsymbol{d}$ orbitals.

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital.

Figure 5.2 illustrates how the sum of the energies of two hydrogen atoms (the colored curve) changes as they approach each other. When the atoms are far apart there is no overlap, and by convention we set the sum of the energies at zero. As the atoms move together, their orbitals begin to overlap. Each electron begins to feel the attraction of the nucleus in the other atom. In addition, the electrons begin to repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still widely separated, the attractions are slightly stronger than the repulsions, and the energy of the system decreases. (A bond begins to form.) As the atoms move closer together, the overlap increases, so the attraction of the nuclei for the electrons continues to increase (as do the repulsions among electrons and between the nuclei). At some specific distance between the atoms, which varies depending on the atoms involved, the energy reaches its lowest (most stable) value. This optimum distance between the two bonded nuclei is the bond distance between the two atoms. The bond is stable because at this point, the attractive and repulsive forces combine to create the lowest possible energy configuration. If the distance between the nuclei were to decrease further, the repulsions between nuclei and the repulsions as electrons are confined in closer proximity to each other would become stronger than the attractive forces. The energy of the system would then rise (making the system destabilized), as shown at the far left of Figure 5.2.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 (a) The interaction of two hydrogen atoms changes as a function of distance. (b) The energy of the system changes as the atoms interact. The lowest (most stable) energy occurs at a distance of 74 pm , which is the bond length observed for the $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ molecule.\n\nIn addition to the distance between two orbitals, the orientation of orbitals also affects their overlap (other than for two $s$ orbitals, which are spherically symmetric). Greater overlap is possible when orbitals are oriented such that they overlap on a direct line between the two nuclei. Figure 5.3 illustrates this for two $p$ orbitals from different atoms; the overlap is greater when the orbitals overlap end to end rather than at an angle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)",

Different shells contain different numbers and kinds of orbitals, and each orbital within a shell can be occupied by two electrons. The first shell contains only a single $s$ orbital, denoted $1 s$, and thus holds only 2 electrons. The second shell contains one $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals and thus holds a total of 8 electrons. The third shell contains a $3 s$ orbital, three $3 p$ orbitals, and five $3 d$ orbitals, for a total capacity of 18 electrons. These orbital groupings and their energy levels are shown in FIGURE 1.5.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.5 Energy levels of electrons in an atom. The first shell holds a maximum of 2 electrons in one $1 s$ orbital; the second shell holds a maximum of 8 electrons in one $2 s$ and three $2 p$ orbitals; the third shell holds a maximum of 18 electrons in one $3 s$, three $3 p$, and $3 d$ orbitals; and so on. The two electrons in each orbital are represented by five up and down arrows, $\\uparrow \\downarrow$.

The first three quantum numbers define the orbital and the fourth quantum number describes the intrinsic electron property called spin. An Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli formulated a general principle that gives the last piece of information that we need to understand the general behavior of electrons in atoms. The Pauli exclusion principle can be formulated as follows: No two electrons in the same atom can have exactly the same set of all the four quantum numbers. What this means is that two electrons can share the same orbital (the same set of the quantum numbers $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ ) only if their spin quantum numbers $m_{s}$ have different values. Since the spin quantum number can only have two values $\\left( \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, no more than two electrons can occupy the same orbital (and if two electrons are located in the same orbital, they must have opposite spins). Therefore, any atomic orbital can be populated by only zero, one, or two electrons.\n\nThe properties and meaning of the quantum numbers of electrons in atoms are briefly summarized in Table 3.1.\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| principal quantum number | $n$ | $1,2,3,4$, <br> $\\ldots$. | shell, the general region for the value of energy <br> for an electron on the orbital |\n| angular momentum or <br> azimuthal quantum number | 1 | $0 \\leq 1 \\leq n$ <br> -1 | subshell, the shape of the orbital |\n| magnetic quantum number | $m_{l}$ | $-1 \\leq m_{l} \\leq$ <br> $l$ | orientation of the orbital |\n\nQuantum Numbers, Their Properties, and Significance\n\n|  | Symbol | Allowed <br> values | Physical meaning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| spin quantum number | $m_{S}$ | $\\frac{1}{2},-\\frac{1}{2}$ | direction of the intrinsic quantum \"spinning\" of <br> the electron |",

The Aufbau Principle - \nWe will now construct the ground-state electron configuration and orbital diagram for a selection of atoms in the first and second periods of the periodic table. Orbital diagrams are pictorial representations of the electron configuration, showing the individual orbitals and the pairing arrangement of electrons. We start with a single hydrogen atom (atomic number 1), which consists of one proton and one electron. Referring to Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27, we would expect to find the electron in the $1 s$ orbital. By convention, the $m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ value is usually filled first. The electron configuration and the orbital diagram are:\n\n\nFollowing hydrogen is the noble gas helium, which has an atomic number of 2 . The helium atom contains two protons and two electrons. The first electron has the same four quantum numbers as the hydrogen atom electron ( $n=1, l=0, m_{l}=0, m_{s}=+\\frac{1}{2}$ ). The second electron also goes into the $1 s$ orbital and fills that orbital. The second electron has the same $n, l$, and $m_{l}$ quantum numbers, but must have the opposite spin quantum number, $m_{s}=-\\frac{1}{2}$. This is in accord with the Pauli exclusion principle: No two electrons in the same atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers. For orbital diagrams, this means two arrows go in each box (representing two electrons in each orbital) and the arrows must point in opposite directions (representing paired spins). The electron configuration and orbital diagram of helium are:\n\n\nThe $n=1$ shell is completely filled in a helium atom.\n\nThe next atom is the alkali metal lithium with an atomic number of 3 .

The remaining electron must occupy the orbital of next lowest energy, the $2 s$ orbital (Figure 3.26 or Figure 3.27). Thus, the electron configuration and orbital diagram of lithium are:\n\n\nAn atom of the alkaline earth metal beryllium, with an atomic number of 4 , contains four protons in the nucleus and four electrons surrounding the nucleus.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nFIGURE 3.22 The chart shows the energies of electron orbitals in a multi-electron atom.\nFigure 3.22 illustrates the energy levels for various orbitals. The number before the orbital name (such as $2 s$, $3 p$, and so forth) stands for the principal quantum number, $n$. The letter in the orbital name defines the subshell with a specific angular momentum quantum number $l=0$ for $s$ orbitals, 1 for $p$ orbitals, 2 for $d$ orbitals. Finally, there are more than one possible orbitals for $l \\geq 1$, each corresponding to a specific value of $m_{l}$. In the case of a hydrogen atom or a one-electron ion (such as $\\mathrm{He}^{+}, \\mathrm{Li}^{2+}$, and so on), energies of all the orbitals with the same $n$ are the same. This is called a degeneracy, and the energy levels for the same principal quantum number, $n$, are called degenerate orbitals. However, in atoms with more than one electron, this degeneracy is eliminated by the electron-electron interactions, and orbitals that belong to different subshells have different energies, as shown on Figure 3.22. Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital. These observations led Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck to propose that electrons have a fourth quantum number. They called this the spin quantum number, or $\\boldsymbol{m}_{\\boldsymbol{s}}$.",

(a) When two electrons are removed from the valence shell, the Ca radius loses the outermost energy level and reverts to the lower $n=3$ level, which is much smaller in radius. (b) The +2 charge on calcium pulls the oxygen much closer compared with K , thereby increasing the lattice energy relative to a less charged ion. (c) Removal of the $4 s$ electron in Ca requires more energy than removal of the $4 s$ electron in $K$ because of the stronger attraction of the nucleus and the extra energy required to break the pairing of the electrons. The second ionization energy for K requires that an electron be removed from a lower energy level, where the attraction is much stronger from the nucleus for the electron. In addition, energy is required to unpair two electrons in a full orbital. For Ca , the second ionization potential requires removing only a lone electron in the exposed outer energy level.

For the $p$-block elements, electrons are removed from the $p$ orbitals and then from the $s$ orbital. Zinc is a member of group 12, so it should have a charge of $2+$, and thus loses only the two electrons in its $S$ orbital.

Solution - \n(a) We write the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as:\n\n\nThis shows us two regions of high electron density around the carbon atom-each double bond counts as one region, and there are no lone pairs on the carbon atom. Using VSEPR theory, we predict that the two regions of electron density arrange themselves on opposite sides of the central atom with a bond angle of $180^{\\circ}$. The\nelectron-pair geometry and molecular structure are identical, and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules are linear.\n(b) We write the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ as:\n\n\nThus we see that $\\mathrm{BCl}_{3}$ contains three bonds, and there are no lone pairs of electrons on boron. The arrangement of three regions of high electron density gives a trigonal planar electron-pair geometry.

Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 4.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as $\\mathrm{XeO}_{2}$ do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.)\n\n\nFIGURE 4.6 The electronegativity values derived by Pauling follow predictable periodic trends, with the higher electronegativities toward the upper right of the periodic table.",

If we slowly push in the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa. Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed in Figure 8.13.\n\n\n\n\nFIGURE 8.13 When a gas occupies a smaller volume, it exerts a higher pressure; when it occupies a larger volume, it exerts a lower pressure (assuming the amount of gas and the temperature do not change).

Pressure and Temperature: Amontons's Law - \nImagine filling a rigid container attached to a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas may escape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its pressure is observed to decrease. Since the container is rigid and tightly sealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we heat the sphere, the gas inside gets hotter (Figure 8.10) and the pressure increases.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.10 The effect of temperature on gas pressure: When the hot plate is off, the pressure of the gas in the sphere is relatively low. As the gas is heated, the pressure of the gas in the sphere increases.\n\nThis relationship between temperature and pressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume. An example of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air under these conditions in Figure 8.11. We find that temperature and pressure are linearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then $P$ and $T$ are directly proportional (again, when volume and moles of gas are held constant); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor, the gas pressure increases by the same factor.\n\n| Temperature <br> $\\left({ }^{\\circ} \\mathbf{C}\\right)$ | Temperature <br> $\\mathbf{( K )}$ | Pressure <br> $\\mathbf{( k P a )}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| -100 | 173 | 36.0 |\n| -50 | 223 | 46.4 |\n| 0 | 273 | 56.7 |\n| 50 | 323 | 67.1 |\n| 100 | 373 | 77.5 |\n| 150 | 423 | 88.0 |\n\n\n\nFIGURE 8.11 For a constant volume and amount of air, the pressure and temperature are directly proportional, provided the temperature is in kelvin.

The Formation of Solutions - \nValve closed\n\n\nValve open\n\nFIGURE 11.3 Samples of helium and argon spontaneously mix to give a solution.\nIdeal solutions may also form when structurally similar liquids are mixed. For example, mixtures of the alcohols methanol $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}\\right)$ and ethanol $\\left(\\mathrm{C}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{OH}\\right)$ form ideal solutions, as do mixtures of the hydrocarbons pentane, $\\mathrm{C}_{5} \\mathrm{H}_{12}$, and hexane, $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{14}$. Placing methanol and ethanol, or pentane and hexane, in the bulbs shown in Figure 11.3 will result in the same diffusion and subsequent mixing of these liquids as is observed for the He and Ar gases (although at a much slower rate), yielding solutions with no significant change in energy. Unlike a mixture of gases, however, the components of these liquid-liquid solutions do, indeed, experience intermolecular attractive forces. But since the molecules of the two substances being mixed are structurally very similar, the intermolecular attractive forces between like and unlike molecules are essentially the same, and the dissolution process, therefore, does not entail any appreciable increase or decrease in energy. These examples illustrate how increased matter dispersal alone can provide the driving force required to cause the spontaneous formation of a solution. In some cases, however, the relative magnitudes of intermolecular forces of attraction between solute and solvent species may prevent dissolution.\n\nThree types of intermolecular attractive forces are relevant to the dissolution process: solute-solute, solventsolvent, and solute-solvent. As illustrated in Figure 11.4, the formation of a solution may be viewed as a stepwise process in which energy is consumed to overcome solute-solute and solvent-solvent attractions (endothermic processes) and released when solute-solvent attractions are established (an exothermic process referred to as solvation). The relative magnitudes of the energy changes associated with these stepwise processes determine whether the dissolution process overall will release or absorb energy. In some cases, solutions do not form because the energy required to separate solute and solvent species is so much greater than the energy released by solvation.",

Osmosis and Osmotic Pressure of Solutions - \nA number of natural and synthetic materials exhibit selective permeation, meaning that only molecules or ions of a certain size, shape, polarity, charge, and so forth, are capable of passing through (permeating) the material. Biological cell membranes provide elegant examples of selective permeation in nature, while dialysis tubing used to remove metabolic wastes from blood is a more simplistic technological example. Regardless of how they may be fabricated, these materials are generally referred to as semipermeable membranes.\n\nConsider the apparatus illustrated in Figure 11.24, in which samples of pure solvent and a solution are separated by a membrane that only solvent molecules may permeate. Solvent molecules will diffuse across the membrane in both directions. Since the concentration of solvent is greater in the pure solvent than the solution, these molecules will diffuse from the solvent side of the membrane to the solution side at a faster rate than they will in the reverse direction. The result is a net transfer of solvent molecules from the pure solvent to the solution. Diffusion-driven transfer of solvent molecules through a semipermeable membrane is a process known as osmosis.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.24 (a) A solution and pure solvent are initially separated by an osmotic membrane. (b) Net transfer of solvent molecules to the solution occurs until its osmotic pressure yields equal rates of transfer in both directions.\n\nWhen osmosis is carried out in an apparatus like that shown in Figure 11.24, the volume of the solution increases as it becomes diluted by accumulation of solvent. This causes the level of the solution to rise, increasing its hydrostatic pressure (due to the weight of the column of solution in the tube) and resulting in a faster transfer of solvent molecules back to the pure solvent side. When the pressure reaches a value that yields a reverse solvent transfer rate equal to the osmosis rate, bulk transfer of solvent ceases. This pressure is called the osmotic pressure ( $\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}$ ) of the solution. The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution is related to its solute molarity, $M$, and absolute temperature, $T$, according to the equation\n\n$$\n\\Pi=M R T\n$$\n\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.",

The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom.

Although gaseous molecules travel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with other gaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired target. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions per second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the molecule\n\nIn general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed container, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by which molecules disperse in space in response to differences in concentration is called diffusion (shown in Figure 8.27). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware of any concentration gradient, they simply move randomly-regions of higher concentration have more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of species from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment, diffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, as depicted in Figure 8.27. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations are the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net transfer of molecules occurs).\n\n\nFIGURE 8.27 (a) Two gases, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, are initially separated.

The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton's Law - \nUnless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other's pressure.

Pressure and Temperature: Amontons's Law - \nGuillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature of a gas ( $\\sim 1700$ ), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely (~1800). Because of this, the $P$ - $T$ relationship for gases is known as either Amontons's law or Gay-Lussac's law. Under either name, it states that the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant. Mathematically, this can be written:\n\n$$\nP \\propto T \\text { or } P=\\text { constant } \\times T \\text { or } P=k \\times T\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ means \"is proportional to,\" and $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the identity, amount, and volume of the gas.\n\nFor a confined, constant volume of gas, the ratio $\\frac{P}{T}$ is therefore constant (i.e., $\\frac{P}{T}=k$ ). If the gas is initially in \"Condition 1\" (with $P=P_{1}$ and $T=T_{1}$ ), and then changes to \"Condition 2\" (with $P=P_{2}$ and $T=T_{2}$ ), we have that $\\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=k$ and $\\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}=k$, which reduces to $\\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=\\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}$. This equation is useful for pressure-temperature calculations for a confined gas at constant volume. Note that temperatures must be on the kelvin scale for any gas law calculations ( 0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature is called absolute zero). (Also note that there are at least three ways we can describe how the pressure of a gas changes as its temperature changes: We can use a table of values, a graph, or a mathematical equation.)",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom.

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.

When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

The sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the remaining Crab Nebula (Figure 3.1) continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms. We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from thousands of light years away.",

Because they're positively charged, these spinning nuclei act like tiny magnets and can interact with an external magnetic field, denoted $\\boldsymbol{B}_{0}$. Not all nuclei act this way, but fortunately for organic chemists, both the proton $\\left({ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$ and the ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus do have spins. The more common ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ isotope, however, does not have nuclear spin.

Let's see what the consequences of nuclear spin are and how we can use the results.\n\nIn the absence of an external magnetic field, the spins of magnetic nuclei are oriented randomly. When a sample containing these nuclei is placed between the poles of a strong magnet, however, the nuclei adopt specific orientations, much as a compass needle orients in the earth's magnetic field. A spinning ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nucleus can orient so that its own tiny magnetic field is aligned either with (parallel to) or against (antiparallel to) the external field. The two orientations don't have the same energy, however, and aren't equally likely. The parallel orientation is slightly lower in energy by an amount that depends on the strength of the external field, making this spin state very slightly favored over the antiparallel orientation (FIGURE 13.2).\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n\nFIGURE 13.2 (a) Nuclear spins are oriented randomly in the absence of an external magnetic field but (b) have a specific orientation in the presence of an external field, $\\boldsymbol{B}_{\\mathbf{0}}$.

One Latin connotation for the word \"mole\" is \"large mass\" or \"bulk,\" which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has far-reaching applications in many scientific fields, particularly in chemical structure determination. Although we'll just give an overview of the subject in this chapter, focusing on NMR applications with small molecules, more advanced NMR techniques are also used in biological chemistry to study protein structure and folding.\n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most valuable spectroscopic technique available to organic chemists. It's the method of structure determination that organic chemists usually turn to first.\n\nWe saw in the chapter on Structure Determination: Mass Spectrometry and Infrared Spectroscopy that mass spectrometry gives a molecule's formula and infrared spectroscopy identifies a molecule's functional groups. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy complements these other techniques by mapping a molecule's carbon-hydrogen framework. Taken together, MS, IR, and NMR make it possible to determine the structures of even very complex molecules.\n\n| Mass spectrometry | Molecular size and formula |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Infrared spectroscopy | Functional groups present |\n| NMR spectroscopy | Map of carbon-hydrogen framework |",

The spins of nonequivalent aromatic protons on substituted rings often couple with each other, giving rise to spin-spin splitting patterns that can identify the substitution of the ring.\n\nMuch of the difference in chemical shift between aromatic protons (6.5-8.0 $\\delta$ ) and vinylic protons (4.5-6.5 $\\delta$ ) is due to a property of aromatic rings called ring-current. When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized $\\pi$ electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.\nNote that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring. If a ring were large enough to have both \"inside\" and \"outside\" protons, the protons on the outside would be deshielded and absorb\nat a field lower than normal but those on the inside would be shielded and absorb at a field higher than normal. This prediction has been strikingly confirmed by studies on [18]annulene, an $18-\\pi$-electron cyclic conjugated polyene that contains a Hückel number of electrons $(4 n+2=18$ when $n=4)$. The six inside protons of [18]annulene are strongly shielded by the aromatic ring-current and absorb at $-3.0 \\delta$ (that is, 3.0 ppm upfield from TMS, off the normal chart), while the 12 outside protons are strongly deshielded and absorb in the typical aromatic region at 9.3 ppm downfield from TMS.\n\n\n[18]Annulene\n\n$$\n\\text { Inside } \\mathrm{H}:-3.0 \\delta\n$$",

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to $1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$.\n\nProtons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of $1+$ and a mass of 1.0073 amu . Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu . Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1 - and a mass of 0.00055 amu . The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) and is the property that defines an atom's elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is\napproximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.\n\nIsotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.",

The exact value of the coupling constant between two neighboring protons depends on the geometry of the molecule, but a typical value for an openchain alkane is $J=6$ to 8 Hz . The same coupling constant is shared by both groups of hydrogens whose spins are coupled and is independent of spectrometer field strength.

If two multiplets have the same coupling constant, they are probably related, and the protons causing those multiplets are therefore adjacent in the molecule.\n\nThe most commonly observed coupling patterns and the relative intensities of lines in their multiplets are listed in TABLE 13.4. Note that it's not possible for a given proton to have five equivalent neighboring protons. (Why not?)

If so, we would observe only a single NMR absorption signal in the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ spectrum of a molecule, a situation that would be of little use. In fact, the absorption frequency is not the same for all ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or all ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nuclei.\n\nAll nuclei in molecules are surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule, the electrons moving around nuclei set up tiny local magnetic fields of their own.

Because each chemically distinct nucleus in a molecule is in a slightly different electronic environment, each nucleus is shielded to a slightly different extent and the effective magnetic field felt by each is slightly different. These tiny differences in the effective magnetic fields experienced by different nuclei can be detected, and we thus see a distinct NMR signal for each chemically distinct ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ or ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus in a molecule.

Dalton postulated that each element has a characteristic type of atom that differs in properties from atoms of all other elements, and that atoms of different elements can combine in fixed, small, wholenumber ratios to form compounds. Samples of a particular compound all have the same elemental\nproportions by mass. When two elements form different compounds, a given mass of one element will combine with masses of the other element in a small, whole-number ratio.

Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron added enters an $s$ or a $p$ orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in Figure 3.29. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest $n$ level. For example, gallium ( Ga , atomic number 31) has the electron configuration $[\\operatorname{Ar}] 4 s^{2} 3 d^{10} 4 p^{1}$, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The completely filled $d$ orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.\n2. Transition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added enters a $d$ orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements include the $n s$ and $(n-1) d$ electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with partially filled $d$ orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg , as well as $\\mathrm{Cu}, \\mathrm{Ag}$, and Au in Figure 3.29) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire $d$ block (colored yellow in Figure 3.29), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.\n3. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an $f$ orbital. They are shown in green in Figure 3.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the $(n-2) f$, the $(n-1) d$, and the $n s$ subshells. There are two inner transition series:\na. The lanthanide series: lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu)\nb. The actinide series: actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)\n\nLanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no $f$ electrons.",

They are similar in that the atoms or molecules are free to move from one position to another. They differ in that the particles of a liquid are confined to the shape of the vessel in which they are placed. In contrast,\na gas will expand without limit to fill the space into which it is placed.\n3. All atoms and molecules will condense into a liquid or solid in which the attractive forces exceed the kinetic energy of the molecules, at sufficiently low temperature.\n4. (a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom. The electrostatic attraction between the partially positive hydrogen atom in one molecule and the partially negative atom in another molecule gives rise to a strong dipole-dipole interaction called a hydrogen bond (e.g., HF...HF ).\n5.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles. He predicted that a particle with mass $m$ and velocity $v$ (that is, with linear momentum $p$ ) should also exhibit the behavior of a wave with a wavelength value $\\lambda$, given by this expression in which $h$ is the familiar Planck's constant:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\frac{h}{m v}=\\frac{h}{p}\n$$",

Both involve a relatively heavy nucleus with electrons moving around it, although strictly speaking, the Bohr model works only for one-electron atoms or ions. According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom.

Nuclear Binding Energy - \nAs a simple example of the energy associated with the strong nuclear force, consider the helium atom composed of two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons.

This difference between the calculated and experimentally measured masses is known as the mass defect of the atom. In the case of helium, the mass defect indicates a \"loss\" in mass of $4.0331 \\mathrm{amu}-4.0026 \\mathrm{amu}=0.0305 \\mathrm{amu}$. The loss in mass accompanying the formation of an atom from protons, neutrons, and electrons is due to the conversion of that mass into energy that is evolved as the atom forms. The nuclear binding energy is the energy produced when the atoms' nucleons are bound together; this is also the energy needed to break a nucleus into its constituent protons and neutrons. In comparison to chemical bond energies, nuclear binding energies are vastly greater, as we will learn in this section. Consequently, the energy changes associated with nuclear reactions are vastly greater than are those for chemical reactions.\n\nThe conversion between mass and energy is most identifiably represented by the mass-energy equivalence equation as stated by Albert Einstein:\n\n$$\nE=m c^{2}\n$$",

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Types of Radioactive Decay - \nErnest Rutherford's experiments involving the interaction of radiation with a magnetic or electric field (Figure 20.6) helped him determine that one type of radiation consisted of positively charged and relatively massive $\\alpha$ particles; a second type was made up of negatively charged and much less massive $\\beta$ particles; and a third was uncharged electromagnetic waves, $\\gamma$ rays. We now know that $\\alpha$ particles are high-energy helium nuclei, $\\beta$ particles are high-energy electrons, and $\\gamma$ radiation compose high-energy electromagnetic radiation. We classify different types of radioactive decay by the radiation produced.\n\n\nFIGURE 20.6 Alpha particles, which are attracted to the negative plate and deflected by a relatively small amount, must be positively charged and relatively massive. Beta particles, which are attracted to the positive plate and deflected a relatively large amount, must be negatively charged and relatively light. Gamma rays, which are unaffected by the electric field, must be uncharged.\n\nAlpha ( $\\alpha$ ) decay is the emission of an $\\alpha$ particle from the nucleus.

If the parent nuclide undergoing $\\alpha$ decay lies below the band of stability (refer to Figure 20.2), the daughter nuclide will lie closer to the band.\n\nBeta ( $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ ) decay is the emission of an electron from a nucleus.

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \nWe know how matter behaves in the macroscopic world-objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye follow the rules of classical physics. A billiard ball moving on a table will behave like a particle: It will continue in a straight line unless it collides with another ball or the table cushion, or is acted on by some other force (such as friction). The ball has a well-defined position and velocity (or a well-defined momentum, $p=m v$, defined by mass $m$ and velocity $v$ ) at any given moment. In other words, the ball is moving in a classical trajectory. This is the typical behavior of a classical object.\n\nWhen waves interact with each other, they show interference patterns that are not displayed by macroscopic particles such as the billiard ball. For example, interacting waves on the surface of water can produce interference patterns similar to those shown on Figure 3.16. This is a case of wave behavior on the macroscopic scale, and it is clear that particles and waves are very different phenomena in the macroscopic realm.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.16 An interference pattern on the water surface is formed by interacting waves. The waves are caused by reflection of water from the rocks. (credit: modification of work by Sukanto Debnath)\n\nAs technological improvements allowed scientists to probe the microscopic world in greater detail, it became increasingly clear by the 1920s that very small pieces of matter follow a different set of rules from those we observe for large objects. The unquestionable separation of waves and particles was no longer the case for the microscopic world.\n\nOne of the first people to pay attention to the special behavior of the microscopic world was Louis de Broglie. He asked the question: If electromagnetic radiation can have particle-like character, can electrons and other submicroscopic particles exhibit wavelike character? In his 1925 doctoral dissertation, de Broglie extended the wave-particle duality of light that Einstein used to resolve the photoelectric-effect paradox to material particles.

(a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar).

Both models have a central positively charged nucleus with electrons moving about the nucleus in accordance with the Coulomb electrostatic potential. The Bohr model assumes that the electrons move in circular orbits that have quantized energies, angular momentum, and radii that are specified by a single quantum number, $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$, but this quantization is an ad hoc assumption made by Bohr to incorporate quantization into an essentially classical mechanics description of the atom. Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit. In the quantum mechanical model, the electrons\ndo not move in precise orbits (such orbits violate the Heisenberg uncertainty principle) and, instead, a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position at any given instant is used, with a mathematical function $\\psi$ called a wavefunction that can be used to determine the electron's spatial probability distribution. These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current.

If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor.

This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

A thin glass tube containing the sample solution is placed between the poles of a strong magnet and irradiated with rf energy.\n\nNMR spectroscopy differs from IR spectroscopy (Section 12.6-Section 12.8) in that the timescales of the two techniques are quite different. The absorption of infrared energy by a molecule giving rise to a change in vibrational amplitude is an essentially instantaneous process (about $10^{-13} \\mathrm{~s}$ ), but the NMR process is much slower (about $10^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}$ ). This difference in timescales between IR and NMR spectroscopy is analogous to the difference between cameras operating at very fast and very slow shutter speeds. The fast camera (IR) takes an instantaneous picture and freezes the action. If two rapidly interconverting species are present, IR spectroscopy records the spectrum of both. The slow camera (NMR), however, takes a blurred, time-averaged picture. If two species interconverting faster than $10^{3}$ times per second are present in a sample, NMR records only a single, averaged spectrum, rather than separate spectra of the two discrete species.\n\nBecause of this blurring effect, NMR spectroscopy can be used to measure the rates and activation energies of very fast chemical processes. In cyclohexane, for example, a ring-flip (Section 4.6) occurs so rapidly at room temperature that axial and equatorial hydrogens can't be distinguished by NMR; only a single, averaged ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR absorption is seen for cyclohexane at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ). The amplitude is the height of a wave, measured from midpoint to peak.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

Meteorology, Climatology, and Atmospheric Science - \nThroughout the ages, people have observed clouds, winds, and precipitation, trying to discern patterns and make predictions: when it is best to plant and harvest; whether it is safe to set out on a sea voyage; and much more. We now face complex weather and atmosphere-related challenges that will have a major impact on our civilization and the ecosystem. Several different scientific disciplines use chemical principles to help us better understand weather, the atmosphere, and climate. These are meteorology, climatology, and atmospheric science. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere, atmospheric phenomena, and atmospheric effects on earth's weather. Meteorologists seek to understand and predict the weather in the short term, which can save lives and benefit the economy. Weather forecasts (Figure 8.7) are the result of thousands of measurements of air pressure, temperature, and the like, which are compiled, modeled, and analyzed in weather centers worldwide.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.7 Meteorologists use weather maps to describe and predict weather. Regions of high (H) and low (L) pressure have large effects on weather conditions. The gray lines represent locations of constant pressure known as isobars. (credit: modification of work by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\n\nIn terms of weather, low-pressure systems occur when the earth's surface atmospheric pressure is lower than the surrounding environment: Moist air rises and condenses, producing clouds. Movement of moisture and air within various weather fronts instigates most weather events.\n\nThe atmosphere is the gaseous layer that surrounds a planet. Earth's atmosphere, which is roughly 100-125 km thick, consists of roughly $78.1 \\%$ nitrogen and $21.0 \\%$ oxygen, and can be subdivided further into the regions shown in Figure 8.8: the exosphere (furthest from earth, $>700 \\mathrm{~km}$ above sea level), the thermosphere ( $80-700 \\mathrm{~km}$ ), the mesosphere ( $50-80 \\mathrm{~km}$ ), the stratosphere (second lowest level of our atmosphere, $12-50 \\mathrm{~km}$ above sea level), and the troposphere (up to 12 km above sea level, roughly $80 \\%$ of the earth's atmosphere by mass and the layer where most weather events originate).

Line Spectra - \nAnother paradox within the classical electromagnetic theory that scientists in the late nineteenth century struggled with concerned the light emitted from atoms and molecules. When solids, liquids, or condensed gases are heated sufficiently, they radiate some of the excess energy as light. Photons produced in this manner have a range of energies, and thereby produce a continuous spectrum in which an unbroken series of wavelengths is present. Most of the light generated from stars (including our sun) is produced in this fashion. You can see all the visible wavelengths of light present in sunlight by using a prism to separate them. As can be seen in Figure 3.9, sunlight also contains UV light (shorter wavelengths) and IR light (longer wavelengths) that can be detected using instruments but that are invisible to the human eye. Incandescent (glowing) solids such as tungsten filaments in incandescent lights also give off light that contains all wavelengths of visible light. These continuous spectra can often be approximated by blackbody radiation curves at some appropriate temperature, such as those shown in Figure 3.10.\n\nIn contrast to continuous spectra, light can also occur as discrete or line spectra having very narrow line widths interspersed throughout the spectral regions such as those shown in Figure 3.13. Exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current, or heating it, will produce line spectra. Fluorescent light bulbs and neon signs operate in this way (Figure 3.12). Each element displays its own characteristic set of lines, as do molecules, although their spectra are generally much more complicated.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.12 Neon signs operate by exciting a gas at low partial pressure using an electrical current.

Blackbody Radiation and the Ultraviolet Catastrophe - \nPhysicists derived mathematical expressions for the blackbody curves using well-accepted concepts from the theories of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism. The theoretical expressions as functions of temperature fit the observed experimental blackbody curves well at longer wavelengths, but showed significant discrepancies at shorter wavelengths. Not only did the theoretical curves not show a peak, they absurdly showed the intensity becoming infinitely large as the wavelength became smaller, which would imply that everyday objects at room temperature should be emitting large amounts of UV light. This became known as the \"ultraviolet catastrophe\" because no one could find any problems with the theoretical treatment that could lead to such unrealistic short-wavelength behavior. Finally, around 1900, Max Planck derived a theoretical expression for blackbody radiation that fit the experimental observations exactly (within experimental error). Planck developed his theoretical treatment by extending the earlier work that had been based on the premise that the atoms composing the oven vibrated at increasing frequencies (or decreasing wavelengths) as the temperature increased, with these vibrations being the source of the emitted electromagnetic radiation. But where the earlier treatments had allowed the vibrating atoms to have any energy values obtained from a continuous set of energies (perfectly reasonable, according to classical physics), Planck found that by restricting the vibrational energies to discrete values for each frequency, he could derive an expression for blackbody radiation that correctly had the intensity dropping rapidly for the short wavelengths in the UV region.\n\n$$\nE=n h \\nu, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe quantity $h$ is a constant now known as Planck's constant, in his honor.

It had been observed that electrons could be ejected from the clean surface of a metal when light having a frequency greater than some threshold frequency was shone on it. Surprisingly, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons did not depend on the brightness of the light, but increased with increasing frequency of the light. Since the electrons in the metal had a certain amount of binding energy keeping them there, the incident light needed to have more energy to free the electrons. According to classical wave theory, a wave's energy depends on its intensity (which depends on its amplitude), not its frequency. One part of these observations was that the number of electrons ejected within in a given time period was seen to increase as the brightness increased. In 1905, Albert Einstein was able to resolve the paradox by incorporating Planck's quantization findings into the discredited particle view of light (Einstein actually won his Nobel prize for this work, and not for his theories of relativity for which he is most famous).\n\nEinstein argued that the quantized energies that Planck had postulated in his treatment of blackbody radiation could be applied to the light in the photoelectric effect so that the light striking the metal surface should not be viewed as a wave, but instead as a stream of particles (later called photons) whose energy depended on their frequency, according to Planck's formula, $E=h \\nu$ (or, in terms of wavelength using $c=\\nu \\lambda, E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ). Electrons were ejected when hit by photons having sufficient energy (a frequency greater than the threshold). The greater the frequency, the greater the kinetic energy imparted to the escaping electrons by the collisions. Processes that increase the energy of an atom involve the absorption of light and are called endothermic. Processes that decrease the energy involve emission of light and are called exothermic. Einstein also argued that the light intensity did not depend on the amplitude of the incoming wave, but instead corresponded to the number of photons striking the surface within a given time period. This explains why the number of ejected electrons increased with increasing brightness, since the greater the number of incoming photons, the greater the likelihood that they would collide with some of the electrons.",

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

The sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the remaining Crab Nebula (Figure 3.1) continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms. We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from thousands of light years away.",

A thin glass tube containing the sample solution is placed between the poles of a strong magnet and irradiated with rf energy.\n\nNMR spectroscopy differs from IR spectroscopy (Section 12.6-Section 12.8) in that the timescales of the two techniques are quite different. The absorption of infrared energy by a molecule giving rise to a change in vibrational amplitude is an essentially instantaneous process (about $10^{-13} \\mathrm{~s}$ ), but the NMR process is much slower (about $10^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}$ ). This difference in timescales between IR and NMR spectroscopy is analogous to the difference between cameras operating at very fast and very slow shutter speeds. The fast camera (IR) takes an instantaneous picture and freezes the action. If two rapidly interconverting species are present, IR spectroscopy records the spectrum of both. The slow camera (NMR), however, takes a blurred, time-averaged picture. If two species interconverting faster than $10^{3}$ times per second are present in a sample, NMR records only a single, averaged spectrum, rather than separate spectra of the two discrete species.\n\nBecause of this blurring effect, NMR spectroscopy can be used to measure the rates and activation energies of very fast chemical processes. In cyclohexane, for example, a ring-flip (Section 4.6) occurs so rapidly at room temperature that axial and equatorial hydrogens can't be distinguished by NMR; only a single, averaged ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ NMR absorption is seen for cyclohexane at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. At $-90^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, however, the ring-flip is slowed down enough that two absorption peaks are visible, one for the six axial hydrogens and one for the six equatorial hydrogens.

It does introduce several important features of all models used to describe the distribution of electrons in an atom. These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom. As a consequence, the model laid the foundation for the quantum mechanical model of the atom.

Although biological systems are sensitive to heat (as we might know from touching a hot stove or spending a day at the beach in the sun), a large amount of nonionizing radiation is necessary before dangerous levels are reached. Ionizing radiation, however, may cause much more severe damage by breaking bonds or removing electrons in biological molecules, disrupting their structure and function. The damage can also be done indirectly, by first ionizing $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ (the most abundant molecule in living organisms), which forms a $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}^{+}$ion that reacts with water, forming a hydronium ion and a hydroxyl radical:\n\n\nBecause the hydroxyl radical has an unpaired electron, it is highly reactive.

Before beginning a study of these techniques, however, let's briefly review the nature of radiant energy and the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nVisible light, X rays, microwaves, radio waves, and so forth are all different kinds of electromagnetic radiation. Collectively, they make up the electromagnetic spectrum, shown in FIGURE 12.17. The electromagnetic spectrum is arbitrarily divided into regions, with the familiar visible region accounting for only a small portion, from $3.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ to $7.8 \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{~m}$ in wavelength. The visible region is flanked by the infrared and ultraviolet regions.\n\n\nFIGURE 12.17 The electromagnetic spectrum covers a continuous range of wavelengths and frequencies, from radio waves at the lowfrequency end to gamma ( $\\gamma$ ) rays at the high-frequency end. The familiar visible region accounts for only a small portion near the middle of the spectrum.\n\nElectromagnetic radiation is often said to have dual behavior. In some respects, it has the properties of a particle, called a photon, yet in other respects it behaves as an energy wave. Like all waves, electromagnetic radiation is characterized by a wavelength, a frequency, and an amplitude (FIGURE 12.18). The wavelength, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ (Greek lambda), is the distance from one wave maximum to the next. The frequency, $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}$ (Greek nu), is the\nnumber of waves that pass by a fixed point per unit time, usually given in reciprocal seconds $\\left(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right)$, or hertz, $\\mathbf{H z}$ ( $1 \\mathrm{~Hz}=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ).

According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another.

Large quantities of hydrogen are also important in the process of hydrogenation, discussed in the chapter on organic chemistry.\n\nIt is possible to use hydrogen as a nonpolluting fuel. The reaction of hydrogen with oxygen is a very exothermic reaction, releasing 286 kJ of energy per mole of water formed. Hydrogen burns without explosion under controlled conditions.

The compounds formed are crystalline, ionic hydrides that contain the hydride anion, $\\mathrm{H}^{-}$, a strong reducing agent and a strong base, which reacts vigorously with water and other acids to form hydrogen gas.\n\nThe reactions of hydrogen with nonmetals generally produce acidic hydrogen compounds with hydrogen in the 1+ oxidation state. The reactions become more exothermic and vigorous as the electronegativity of the nonmetal increases. Hydrogen reacts with nitrogen and sulfur only when heated, but it reacts explosively with fluorine (forming HF) and, under some conditions, with chlorine (forming HCl ). A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen explodes if ignited. Because of the explosive nature of the reaction, it is necessary to exercise caution when handling hydrogen (or any other combustible gas) to avoid the formation of an explosive mixture in a confined space. Although most hydrides of the nonmetals are acidic, ammonia and phosphine $\\left(\\mathrm{PH}_{3}\\right)$ are very, very weak acids and generally function as bases.

Avogadro's Law Revisited - \nSometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure.\n\nWe can extend Avogadro's law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to $\\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$, a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.\n\nThe explanation for this is illustrated in Figure 8.23. According to Avogadro's law, equal volumes of gaseous $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ reacts with three molecules of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to produce two molecules of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, the volume of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ required is three times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, and the volume of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ produced is two times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.23 One volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ combines with three volumes of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to form two volumes of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.",

Fritz Haber - \nThe formation of additional amounts of ammonia reduces the total pressure exerted by the system and somewhat reduces the stress of the increased pressure.\n\nAlthough increasing the pressure of a mixture of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}, \\mathrm{H}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ will increase the yield of ammonia, at low temperatures, the rate of formation of ammonia is slow. At room temperature, for example, the reaction is so slow that if we prepared a mixture of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, no detectable amount of ammonia would form during our lifetime. The formation of ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen is an exothermic process:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g) \\quad \\Delta H=-92.2 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n$$\n\nThus, increasing the temperature to increase the rate lowers the yield. If we lower the temperature to shift the equilibrium to favor the formation of more ammonia, equilibrium is reached more slowly because of the large decrease of reaction rate with decreasing temperature.\n\nPart of the rate of formation lost by operating at lower temperatures can be recovered by using a catalyst. The net effect of the catalyst on the reaction is to cause equilibrium to be reached more rapidly.\n\n[^10]In the commercial production of ammonia, conditions of about $500^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 150-900 \\mathrm{~atm}$, and the presence of a catalyst are used to give the best compromise among rate, yield, and the cost of the equipment necessary to produce and contain high-pressure gases at high temperatures (Figure 17.20).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.20 Commercial production of ammonia requires heavy equipment to handle the high temperatures and pressures required. This schematic outlines the design of an ammonia plant.\n\nAmong the factors affecting chemical reaction rates discussed earlier in this chapter was the presence of a catalyst, a substance that can increase the reaction rate without being consumed in the reaction. The concepts introduced in the previous section on reaction mechanisms provide the basis for understanding how catalysts are able to accomplish this very important function.",

These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

The energy increases as we move up to the $2 s$ and then $2 p, 3 s$, and $3 p$ orbitals, showing that the increasing $n$ value has more influence on energy than the increasing $l$ value for small atoms. However, this pattern does not hold for larger atoms. The $3 d$ orbital is higher in energy than the $4 s$ orbital. Such overlaps continue to occur frequently as we move up the chart.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale).",

Coupling constants are measured in hertz and generally fall in the range 0 to 18 Hz . The exact value of the coupling constant between two neighboring protons depends on the geometry of the molecule, but a typical value for an openchain alkane is $J=6$ to 8 Hz . The same coupling constant is shared by both groups of hydrogens whose spins are coupled and is independent of spectrometer field strength. In bromoethane, for instance, the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{Br}$ protons\nare coupled to the $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons and appear as a quartet with $J=7 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. The $-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ protons appear as a triplet with the same $J=7 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ coupling constant.\n\nBecause coupling is a reciprocal interaction between two adjacent groups of protons, it's sometimes possible to tell which multiplets in a complex NMR spectrum are related to each other. If two multiplets have the same coupling constant, they are probably related, and the protons causing those multiplets are therefore adjacent in the molecule.\n\nThe most commonly observed coupling patterns and the relative intensities of lines in their multiplets are listed in TABLE 13.4. Note that it's not possible for a given proton to have five equivalent neighboring protons. (Why not?) A six-line multiplet, or sextet, is therefore found only when a proton has five nonequivalent neighboring protons that coincidentally happen to be coupled with an identical coupling constant $J$.\n\nTABLE 13.4 Some Common Spin Multiplicities",

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

Enthalpy\nIf a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction, $q$ for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol $\\Delta H$, or $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ for reactions occurring under standard state conditions at 298 K . The value of $\\Delta H$ for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to $\\Delta H$ for the reaction in the opposite direction, and $\\Delta H$ is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation, $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{H}_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}$, is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess's law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.",

Yet it has been known since the mid-1800s that benzene is much less reactive than typical alkenes and fails to undergo typical alkene addition reactions. Cyclohexene, for instance, reacts rapidly with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and gives the addition product 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, but benzene reacts slowly with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and gives the substitution product $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{Br}$ rather than the addition product.\n\n\nWe can get a quantitative idea of benzene's stability by measuring heats of hydrogenation (Section 7.6). Cyclohexene, an isolated alkene, has $\\Delta H_{\\text {hydrog }}^{\\circ}=-118 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(-28.2 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$, and 1,3-cyclohexadiene, a conjugated diene, has $\\Delta H^{\\circ}{ }_{\\text {hydrog }}=-230 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(-55.0 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$.

Vapor Pressure Lowering - \nAs described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the equilibrium vapor pressure of a liquid is the pressure exerted by its gaseous phase when vaporization and condensation are occurring at equal rates:\n\n$$\n\\text { liquid } \\rightleftharpoons \\text { gas }\n$$\n\nDissolving a nonvolatile substance in a volatile liquid results in a lowering of the liquid's vapor pressure. This phenomenon can be rationalized by considering the effect of added solute molecules on the liquid's vaporization and condensation processes. To vaporize, solvent molecules must be present at the surface of the solution. The presence of solute decreases the surface area available to solvent molecules and thereby reduces the rate of solvent vaporization. Since the rate of condensation is unaffected by the presence of solute, the net result is that the vaporization-condensation equilibrium is achieved with fewer solvent molecules in the vapor phase (i.e., at a lower vapor pressure) (Figure 11.18). While this interpretation is useful, it does not account for several important aspects of the colligative nature of vapor pressure lowering. A more rigorous explanation involves the property of entropy, a topic of discussion in a later text chapter on thermodynamics. For purposes of understanding the lowering of a liquid's vapor pressure, it is adequate to note that the more dispersed nature of matter in a solution, compared to separate solvent and solute phases, serves to effectively stabilize the solvent molecules and hinder their vaporization. A lower vapor pressure results, and a correspondingly\nhigher boiling point as described in the next section of this module.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.18 The presence of nonvolatile solutes lowers the vapor pressure of a solution by impeding the evaporation of solvent molecules.\n\nThe relationship between the vapor pressures of solution components and the concentrations of those components is described by Raoult's law: The partial pressure exerted by any component of an ideal solution is equal to the vapor pressure of the pure component multiplied by its mole fraction in the solution.\n\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{A}}=X_{\\mathrm{A}} P_{\\mathrm{A}}^{*}\n$$",

Distillation of Solutions - \nSolutions whose components have significantly different vapor pressures may be separated by a selective vaporization process known as distillation. Consider the simple case of a mixture of two volatile liquids, A and B, with A being the more volatile liquid. Raoult's law can be used to show that the vapor above the solution is enriched in component A, that is, the mole fraction of A in the vapor is greater than the mole fraction of A in the liquid (see end-of-chapter Exercise 65). By appropriately heating the mixture, component A may be vaporized, condensed, and collected-effectively separating it from component B.\n\nDistillation is widely applied in both laboratory and industrial settings, being used to refine petroleum, to isolate fermentation products, and to purify water. A typical apparatus for laboratory-scale distillations is shown in Figure 11.19.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.19 A typical laboratory distillation unit is shown in (a) a photograph and (b) a schematic diagram of the components.

The crude oil is heated to high temperatures at the base of a tall fractionating column, vaporizing many of the components that rise within the column. As vaporized components reach adequately cool zones during their ascent, they condense and are collected. The collected liquids are simpler mixtures of hydrocarbons and other petroleum compounds that are of appropriate composition for various applications (e.g., diesel fuel, kerosene, gasoline), as depicted in Figure 11.20.\n\n\nSmall molecules:\n\n- Low boiling point\n- Very volatile\n- Flows easily\n- Ignites easily\n\n\nLarge molecules:\n\n- High boiling point\n- Not very volatile\n- Does not flow easily\n- Does not ignite easily\n\nFIGURE 11.20 Crude oil is a complex mixture that is separated by large-scale fractional distillation to isolate various simpler mixtures.",

Boiling Point Elevation - \nAs described in the chapter on liquids and solids, the boiling point of a liquid is the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to ambient atmospheric pressure. Since the vapor pressure of a solution is lowered due to the presence of nonvolatile solutes, it stands to reason that the solution's boiling point will subsequently be increased. Vapor pressure increases with temperature, and so a solution will require a higher temperature than will pure solvent to achieve any given vapor pressure, including one equivalent to that of the surrounding atmosphere.

The Octet Rule - \nThe other halogen molecules ( $\\mathrm{F}_{2}, \\mathrm{Br}_{2}, \\mathrm{I}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{At}_{2}$ ) form bonds like those in the chlorine molecule: one single bond between atoms and three lone pairs of electrons per atom. This allows each halogen atom to have a noble gas electron configuration. The tendency of main group atoms to form enough bonds to obtain eight valence electrons is known as the octet rule.\n\nThe number of bonds that an atom can form can often be predicted from the number of electrons needed to reach an octet (eight valence electrons); this is especially true of the nonmetals of the second period of the periodic table ( $\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{O}$, and F ). For example, each atom of a group 14 element has four electrons in its outermost shell and therefore requires four more electrons to reach an octet. These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated here for carbon in $\\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ (carbon tetrachloride) and silicon in $\\mathrm{SiH}_{4}$ (silane). Because hydrogen only needs two electrons to fill its valence shell, it is an exception to the octet rule. The transition elements and inner transition elements also do not follow the octet rule:\n\n\nGroup 15 elements such as nitrogen have five valence electrons in the atomic Lewis symbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons. To obtain an octet, these atoms form three covalent bonds, as in $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia). Oxygen and other atoms in group 16 obtain an octet by forming two covalent bonds:\n\n\nDouble and Triple Bonds\nAs previously mentioned, when a pair of atoms shares one pair of electrons, we call this a single bond. However, a pair of atoms may need to share more than one pair of electrons in order to achieve the requisite octet.

Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order.

Other interactions, such as nuclear-nuclear repulsions and nuclear-electron attractions, are also involved in the final arrangement that atoms adopt in a particular molecular structure.\n\nAs a simple example of VSEPR theory, let us predict the structure of a gaseous $\\mathrm{BeF}_{2}$ molecule. The Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{BeF}_{2}$ (Figure 4.15) shows only two electron pairs around the central beryllium atom. With two bonds and no lone pairs of electrons on the central atom, the bonds are as far apart as possible, and the electrostatic repulsion between these regions of high electron density is reduced to a minimum when they are on opposite sides of the central atom. The bond angle is $180^{\\circ}$ (Figure 4.15).\n\n$$\n\\because \\ddot{\\mathrm{F}} \\mathrm{Be}_{\\mathrm{Be}}^{180^{\\circ}}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 4.15 The $\\mathrm{BeF}_{2}$ molecule adopts a linear structure in which the two bonds are as far apart as possible, on opposite sides of the Be atom.",

Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 4.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as $\\mathrm{XeO}_{2}$ do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.)\n\n\nFIGURE 4.6 The electronegativity values derived by Pauling follow predictable periodic trends, with the higher electronegativities toward the upper right of the periodic table.",

Hydrogen Bonding - \nFIGURE 10.10 Water molecules participate in multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions with nearby water molecules.\n\nDespite use of the word \"bond,\" keep in mind that hydrogen bonds are intermolecular attractive forces, not intramolecular attractive forces (covalent bonds). Hydrogen bonds are much weaker than covalent bonds, only about 5 to $10 \\%$ as strong, but are generally much stronger than other dipole-dipole attractions and dispersion forces.\n\nHydrogen bonds have a pronounced effect on the properties of condensed phases (liquids and solids).

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Waves - \nAll waves, including forms of electromagnetic radiation, are characterized by, a wavelength (denoted by $\\lambda$, the lowercase Greek letter lambda), a frequency (denoted by $\\nu$, the lowercase Greek letter nu), and an amplitude. As can be seen in Figure 3.2, the wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave (measured in meters in the SI system). Electromagnetic waves have wavelengths that fall within an enormous range-wavelengths of kilometers $\\left(10^{3} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ to picometers $\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$ have been observed. The frequency is the number of wave cycles that pass a specified point in space in a specified amount of time (in the SI system, this is measured in seconds). A cycle corresponds to one complete wavelength. The unit for frequency, expressed as cycles per second $\\left[\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\right]$, is the hertz (Hz). Common multiples of this unit are megahertz, $\\left(1 \\mathrm{MHz}=1 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$ and gigahertz $\\left(1 \\mathrm{GHz}=1 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm{~Hz}\\right)$. The amplitude corresponds to the magnitude of the wave's displacement and so, in Figure 3.2, this corresponds to one-half the height between the peaks and troughs. The amplitude is related to the intensity of the wave, which for light is the brightness, and for sound is the loudness.\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 One-dimensional sinusoidal waves show the relationship among wavelength, frequency, and speed.

Electromagnetic Energy\nLight and other forms of electromagnetic radiation move through a vacuum with a constant speed, $c$, of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. This radiation shows wavelike behavior, which can be characterized by a frequency, $\\nu$, and a wavelength, $\\lambda$, such that $c=\\lambda \\nu$. Light is an example of a travelling wave. Other important wave phenomena include standing waves, periodic oscillations, and vibrations. Standing waves exhibit quantization, since their wavelengths are limited to discrete integer multiples of some characteristic lengths. Electromagnetic radiation that passes through two closely spaced narrow slits having dimensions roughly similar to the wavelength will show an interference pattern that is a result of constructive and destructive interference of the waves. Electromagnetic radiation also demonstrates properties of particles called photons. The energy of a photon is related to the frequency (or alternatively, the wavelength) of the radiation as $E=h \\nu$ (or $E=\\frac{h c}{\\lambda}$ ), where $h$ is Planck's constant. That light demonstrates both wavelike and particle-like behavior is known as wave-particle duality. All forms of electromagnetic radiation share these properties, although various forms including X-rays, visible light, microwaves, and radio waves interact differently with matter and have very different practical applications. Electromagnetic radiation can be generated by exciting matter to higher energies, such as by heating it. The emitted light can be either continuous (incandescent sources like the sun) or discrete (from specific types of excited atoms). Continuous spectra often have distributions that can be approximated as blackbody radiation at some appropriate temperature. The line spectrum of hydrogen can be obtained by passing the light from\npeaks or troughs in a wave\npeaks or troughs in a wave\nan electrified tube of hydrogen gas through a prism. This line spectrum was simple enough that an empirical formula called the Rydberg formula could be derived from the spectrum. Three historically important paradoxes from the late 19th and early 20th centuries that could not be explained within the existing framework of classical mechanics and classical electromagnetism were the blackbody problem, the photoelectric effect, and the discrete spectra of atoms. The resolution of these paradoxes ultimately led to quantum theories that superseded the classical theories.",

(a) Wavelength ( $\\lambda$ ) is the distance between two successive wave maxima. Amplitude is the height of the wave measured from the center. (b)-(c) What we perceive as different kinds of electromagnetic radiation are simply waves with different wavelengths and frequencies.\nMultiplying the wavelength of a wave in meters ( m ) by its frequency in reciprocal seconds ( $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ) gives the speed of the wave in meters per second ( $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}$ ). The rate of travel of all electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum is a constant value, commonly called the \"speed of light\" and abbreviated $c$. Its numerical value is defined as exactly $2.99792458 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, usually rounded off to $3.00 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { Wavelength } \\times \\text { Frequency }=\\text { Speed } \\\\\n& \\qquad \\begin{array}{c}\n\\lambda(\\mathrm{m}) \\times v\\left(\\mathrm{~s}^{-1}\\right)=c(\\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}) \\\\\n\\lambda=\\frac{c}{v} \\text { or } v=\\frac{c}{\\lambda}\n\\end{array}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nJust as matter comes only in discrete units called atoms, electromagnetic energy is transmitted only in discrete amounts called quanta.

The inverse proportionality is illustrated in Figure 3.3. This figure also shows the electromagnetic spectrum, the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation. Each of the various colors of visible light has specific frequencies and wavelengths associated with them, and you can see that visible light makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because the technologies developed to work in various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are different, for reasons of convenience and historical legacies, different units are typically used for different parts of the spectrum. For example, radio waves are usually specified as frequencies (typically in units of MHz ), while the visible region is usually specified in wavelengths (typically in units of $n m$ or angstroms).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.3 Portions of the electromagnetic spectrum are shown in order of decreasing frequency and increasing wavelength.

Shaking the end of a rope transfers energy from your hand to the other end of the rope, dropping a pebble into a pond causes waves to ripple outward along the water's surface, and the expansion of air that accompanies a lightning strike generates sound waves (thunder) that can travel outward for several miles. In each of these cases, kinetic energy is transferred through matter (the rope, water, or air) while the matter remains essentially in place. An insightful example of a wave occurs in sports stadiums when fans in a narrow region of seats rise simultaneously and stand with their arms raised up for a few seconds before sitting down again while the fans in neighboring sections likewise stand up and sit down in sequence. While this wave can quickly encircle a large stadium in a few seconds, none of the fans actually travel with the wave-they all stay in or above their seats.\n\nWaves need not be restricted to travel through matter. As Maxwell showed, electromagnetic waves consist of an electric field oscillating in step with a perpendicular magnetic field, both of which are perpendicular to the direction of travel. These waves can travel through a vacuum at a constant speed of $2.998 \\times 10^{8} \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, the speed of light (denoted by $c$ ).",

Periodic Table of the Elements - \nFIGURE 3.37 Elements in the periodic table are organized according to their properties.\nEven after the periodic nature of elements and the table itself were widely accepted, gaps remained. Mendeleev had predicted, and others including Henry Moseley had later confirmed, that there should be elements below Manganese in Group 7. German chemists Ida Tacke and Walter Noddack set out to find the elements, a quest being pursued by scientists around the world. Their method was unique in that they did not only consider the properties of manganese, but also the elements horizontally adjacent to the missing elements 43 and 75 on the table. Thus, by investigating ores containing minerals of ruthenium (Ru), tungsten (W), osmium (Os), and so on, they were able to identify naturally occurring elements that helped complete the table. Rhenium, one of their discoveries, was one of the last natural elements to be discovered and is the last stable element to be discovered. (Francium, the last natural element to be discovered, was identified by Marguerite Perey in 1939.)\n\nMany elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, but some elements are similar in their behaviors. For example, many elements appear shiny, are malleable (able to be deformed without breaking) and ductile (can be drawn into wires), and conduct heat and electricity well. Other elements are not shiny, malleable, or ductile, and are poor conductors of heat and electricity. We can sort the elements into large classes with common properties: metals (elements that are shiny, malleable, good conductors of heat and electricity-shaded yellow); nonmetals (elements that appear dull, poor conductors of heat and electricity-shaded green); and metalloids (elements that conduct heat and electricity moderately well, and possess some properties of metals and some properties of nonmetals-shaded purple).",

It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms.

This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W=k \\ln (1)=0\n$$\n\nThis limiting condition for a system's entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance's entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions.

At some point, the added energy becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of transitioning to the liquid state, or melting. At this point, the temperature of the solid stops rising, despite the continual input of heat, and it remains constant until all of the solid is melted. Only after all of the solid has melted will continued\nheating increase the temperature of the liquid (Figure 10.26).\n\n\nFIGURE 10.26 (a) This beaker of ice has a temperature of $-12.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.

In a mixture of solid and liquid at equilibrium, the reciprocal processes of melting and freezing occur at equal rates, and the quantities of solid and liquid therefore remain constant. The temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a given substance are in equilibrium is called the melting point of the solid or the freezing point of the liquid. Use of one term or the other is normally dictated by the direction of the phase transition being considered, for example, solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing).",

Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\n\nThe properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of $1+$. Their\nreactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal $\\left(0.5 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{cm}^{3}\\right)$.\n\nThe alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is:\n\n\nFIGURE 18.3 Lithium floats in paraffin oil because its density is less than the density of paraffin oil.\nAlkali metals react directly with all the nonmetals (except the noble gases) to yield binary ionic compounds containing $1+$ metal ions. These metals are so reactive that it is necessary to avoid contact with both moisture and oxygen in the air. Therefore, they are stored in sealed containers under mineral oil, as shown in Figure 18.4 , to prevent contact with air and moisture. The pure metals never exist free (uncombined) in nature due to their high reactivity. In addition, this high reactivity makes it necessary to prepare the metals by electrolysis of alkali metal compounds.",

The properties of the different kinds of crystalline solids are due to the types of particles of which they consist, the arrangements of the particles, and the strengths of the attractions between them. Because their particles experience identical attractions, crystalline solids have distinct melting temperatures; the particles in amorphous solids experience a range of interactions, so they soften gradually and melt over a range of temperatures. Some crystalline solids have defects in the definite repeating pattern of their particles. These defects (which include vacancies, atoms or ions not in the regular positions, and impurities) change physical properties such as electrical conductivity, which is exploited in the silicon crystals used to manufacture computer chips.",

The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to $1.6605 \\times 10^{-24} \\mathrm{~g}$.\n\nProtons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of $1+$ and a mass of 1.0073 amu . Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu . Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1 - and a mass of 0.00055 amu . The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number ( Z ) and is the property that defines an atom's elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is\napproximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.\n\nIsotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.",

Converting one mole of fluorine atoms into fluoride ions is an exothermic process, so this step gives off energy (the electron affinity) and is shown as decreasing along the $y$-axis. We now have one mole of Cs cations and one mole of F anions. These ions combine to produce solid cesium fluoride. The enthalpy change in this step is the negative of the lattice energy, so it is also an exothermic quantity.

(a) Dispersion forces occur as an atom develops a temporary dipole moment when its electrons are distributed asymmetrically about the nucleus. This structure is more prevalent in large atoms such as argon or radon. A second atom can then be distorted by the appearance of the dipole in the first atom. The electrons of the second atom are attracted toward the positive end of the first atom, which sets up a dipole in the second atom. The net result is rapidly fluctuating, temporary dipoles that attract one another (e.g., Ar). (b) A dipole-dipole attraction is a force that results from an electrostatic attraction of the positive end of one polar molecule for the negative end of another polar molecule (e.g., ICI molecules attract one another by dipole-dipole interaction). (c) Hydrogen bonds form whenever a hydrogen atom is bonded to one of the more electronegative atoms, such as a fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen atom.

The values of first ionization energy for the elements are given in Figure 3.34. Within a period, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ generally increases with increasing $Z$. Down a group, the $\\mathrm{IE}_{1}$ value generally decreases with increasing $Z$. There are some systematic deviations from this trend, however. Note that the ionization energy of boron (atomic number 5) is less than that of beryllium (atomic number 4) even though the nuclear charge of boron is greater by one proton. This can be explained because the energy of the subshells increases as $l$ increases, due to penetration and shielding (as discussed previously in this chapter). Within any one shell, the $s$ electrons are lower in energy than the $p$ electrons. This means that an $s$ electron is harder to remove from an atom than a $p$ electron in the same shell. The electron removed during the ionization of beryllium ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2}$ ) is an $s$ electron, whereas the electron removed during the ionization of boron ( $[\\mathrm{He}] 2 s^{2} 2 p^{1}$ ) is a $p$ electron; this results in a lower first ionization energy for boron, even though its nuclear charge is greater by one proton. Thus, we see a small deviation from the predicted trend occurring each time a new subshell begins.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.33 The first ionization energy of the elements in the first five periods are plotted against their atomic number.\n\nFirst Ionization Energies of Some Elements (kJ/mol)",

These are the elements where the electrons are entering the $s$ and $p$ orbitals. The representative elements occur in groups 1, 2, and 12-18. These elements are representative metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. The alkali metals (group 1) are very reactive, readily form ions with a charge of $1+$ to form ionic compounds that are usually soluble in water, and react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. The outermost electrons of the alkaline earth metals (group 2) are more difficult to remove than the outer electron of the alkali metals, leading to the group 2 metals being less reactive than those in group 1. These elements easily form compounds in which the metals exhibit an oxidation state of $2+$. Zinc, cadmium, and mercury (group 12) commonly exhibit the group oxidation state of 2+ (although mercury also exhibits an oxidation state of $1+$ in compounds that contain $\\mathrm{Hg}_{2}{ }^{2+}$ ). Aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium (group 13) are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen.

Sulfur - \nAs seen in this discussion, an important feature of the structural behavior of the nonmetals is that the elements usually occur with eight electrons in their valence shells. If necessary, the elements form enough covalent bonds to supplement the electrons already present to possess an octet. For example, members of group 15 have five valence electrons and require only three additional electrons to fill their valence shells. These elements form three covalent bonds in their free state: triple bonds in the $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ molecule or single bonds to three different atoms in arsenic and phosphorus. The elements of group 16 require only two additional electrons. Oxygen forms a double bond in the $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule, and sulfur, selenium, and tellurium form two single bonds in various rings and chains. The halogens form diatomic molecules in which each atom is involved in only one bond. This provides the electron required necessary to complete the octet on the halogen atom.

Because an atom is neutral overall, the number of positive protons in the nucleus and the number of negative electrons surrounding the nucleus are the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 A schematic view of an atom. The dense, positively charged nucleus contains most of the atom's mass and is surrounded by negatively charged electrons.

Electron Configuration Table - \nWhen we come to the next element in the periodic table, the alkali metal potassium (atomic number 19), we might expect that we would begin to add electrons to the $3 d$ subshell. However, all available chemical and physical evidence indicates that potassium is like lithium and sodium, and that the next electron is not added to the $3 d$ level but is, instead, added to the $4 s$ level (Figure 3.29). As discussed previously, the $3 d$ orbital with no radial nodes is higher in energy because it is less penetrating and more shielded from the nucleus than the $4 s$, which has three radial nodes. Thus, potassium has an electron configuration of [Ar]4s ${ }^{1}$. Hence, potassium corresponds to Li and Na in its valence shell configuration.

Beginning with hydrogen, and continuing across the periods of the periodic table, we add one proton at a time to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell until we have described the electron configurations of all the elements. This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (\"to build up\"). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be $4 \\mathrm{~s}(\\mathrm{~K}, \\mathrm{Ca})$, followed by the $3 d$ orbitals.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron configurations.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.27 This partial periodic table shows electron configurations for the valence subshells of atoms. By \"building up\" from hydrogen, this table can be used to determine the electron configuration for atoms of most elements in the periodic table. (Electron configurations of the lanthanides and actinides are not accurately predicted by this simple approach. See Figure 3.29",

Main group elements (sometimes called representative elements) are those in which the last electron added enters an $s$ or a $p$ orbital in the outermost shell, shown in blue and red in Figure 3.29. This category includes all the nonmetallic elements, as well as many metals and the metalloids. The valence electrons for main group elements are those with the highest $n$ level. For example, gallium ( Ga , atomic number 31) has the electron configuration $[\\operatorname{Ar}] 4 s^{2} 3 d^{10} 4 p^{1}$, which contains three valence electrons (underlined). The completely filled $d$ orbitals count as core, not valence, electrons.\n2. Transition elements or transition metals. These are metallic elements in which the last electron added enters a $d$ orbital. The valence electrons (those added after the last noble gas configuration) in these elements include the $n s$ and $(n-1) d$ electrons. The official IUPAC definition of transition elements specifies those with partially filled $d$ orbitals. Thus, the elements with completely filled orbitals (Zn, Cd, Hg , as well as $\\mathrm{Cu}, \\mathrm{Ag}$, and Au in Figure 3.29) are not technically transition elements. However, the term is frequently used to refer to the entire $d$ block (colored yellow in Figure 3.29), and we will adopt this usage in this textbook.\n3. Inner transition elements are metallic elements in which the last electron added occupies an $f$ orbital. They are shown in green in Figure 3.29. The valence shells of the inner transition elements consist of the $(n-2) f$, the $(n-1) d$, and the $n s$ subshells. There are two inner transition series:\na. The lanthanide series: lanthanum (La) through lutetium (Lu)\nb. The actinide series: actinium (Ac) through lawrencium (Lr)\n\nLanthanum and actinium, because of their similarities to the other members of the series, are included and used to name the series, even though they are transition metals with no $f$ electrons.",

At some point, the added energy becomes large enough to partially overcome the forces holding the molecules or ions of the solid in their fixed positions, and the solid begins the process of transitioning to the liquid state, or melting. At this point, the temperature of the solid stops rising, despite the continual input of heat, and it remains constant until all of the solid is melted. Only after all of the solid has melted will continued\nheating increase the temperature of the liquid (Figure 10.26).\n\n\nFIGURE 10.26 (a) This beaker of ice has a temperature of $-12.0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. (b) After 10 minutes the ice has absorbed enough heat from the air to warm to $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. A small amount has melted. (c) Thirty minutes later, the ice has absorbed more heat, but its temperature is still $0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The ice melts without changing its temperature. (d) Only after all the ice has melted does the heat absorbed cause the temperature to increase to $22.2^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)\n\nIf we stop heating during melting and place the mixture of solid and liquid in a perfectly insulated container so no heat can enter or escape, the solid and liquid phases remain in equilibrium. This is almost the situation with a mixture of ice and water in a very good thermos bottle; almost no heat gets in or out, and the mixture of solid ice and liquid water remains for hours. In a mixture of solid and liquid at equilibrium, the reciprocal processes of melting and freezing occur at equal rates, and the quantities of solid and liquid therefore remain constant. The temperature at which the solid and liquid phases of a given substance are in equilibrium is called the melting point of the solid or the freezing point of the liquid. Use of one term or the other is normally dictated by the direction of the phase transition being considered, for example, solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to solid (freezing).",

A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly\nobserved. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of $374^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm , and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure.

But some properties of water fall into the microscopic domain-what cannot be observed with the naked eye.

The formula $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, which can describe water at either the macroscopic or microscopic levels, is an example of the symbolic domain.

With these contributions in mind, consider the entropy of a pure, perfectly crystalline solid possessing no kinetic energy (that is, at a temperature of absolute zero, 0 K ). This system may be described by a single microstate, as its purity, perfect crystallinity and complete lack of motion means there is but one possible location for each identical atom or molecule comprising the crystal ( $W=1$ ). According to the Boltzmann equation, the entropy of this system is zero.\n\n$$\nS=k \\ln W=k \\ln (1)=0\n$$\n\nThis limiting condition for a system's entropy represents the third law of thermodynamics: the entropy of a pure, perfect crystalline substance at 0 K is zero.\n\nCareful calorimetric measurements can be made to determine the temperature dependence of a substance's entropy and to derive absolute entropy values under specific conditions.

The relation applies to matter being heated or cooled, but not undergoing a change in state. When a substance being heated or cooled reaches a temperature corresponding to one of its phase transitions, further gain or loss of heat is a result of diminishing or enhancing intermolecular attractions, instead of increasing or decreasing molecular kinetic energies. While a substance is undergoing a change in state, its temperature remains constant. Figure 10.29 shows a typical heating curve.\n\nConsider the example of heating a pot of water to boiling. A stove burner will supply heat at a roughly constant rate; initially, this heat serves to increase the water's temperature. When the water reaches its boiling point, the temperature remains constant despite the continued input of heat from the stove burner. This same temperature is maintained by the water as long as it is boiling. If the burner setting is increased to provide heat at a greater rate, the water temperature does not rise, but instead the boiling becomes more vigorous (rapid). This behavior is observed for other phase transitions as well: For example, temperature remains constant while the change of state is in progress.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.29 A typical heating curve for a substance depicts changes in temperature that result as the substance absorbs increasing amounts of heat.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics - \nThe previous section described the various contributions of matter and energy dispersal that contribute to the entropy of a system.

These features include the following:\n\n- The energies of electrons (energy levels) in an atom are quantized, described by quantum numbers: integer numbers having only specific allowed value and used to characterize the arrangement of electrons in an atom.\n- An electron's energy increases with increasing distance from the nucleus.\n- The discrete energies (lines) in the spectra of the elements result from quantized electronic energies.\n\nOf these features, the most important is the postulate of quantized energy levels for an electron in an atom.

According to classical mechanics, the Rutherford model predicts a miniature \"solar system\" with electrons moving about the nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits that are confined to planes. If the requirements of classical electromagnetic theory that electrons in such orbits would emit electromagnetic radiation are ignored, such atoms would be stable, having constant energy and angular momentum, but would not emit any visible light (contrary to observation). If classical electromagnetic theory is applied, then the Rutherford atom would emit electromagnetic radiation of continually increasing frequency (contrary to the observed discrete spectra), thereby losing energy until the atom collapsed in an absurdly short time (contrary to the observed long-term stability of atoms). The Bohr model retains the classical mechanics view of circular orbits confined to planes having constant energy and angular momentum, but restricts these to quantized values dependent on a single quantum number, $n$. The orbiting electron in Bohr's model is assumed not to emit any electromagnetic radiation while moving about the nucleus in its stationary orbits, but the atom can emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation when the electron changes from one orbit to another. Because of the quantized orbits, such \"quantum jumps\" will produce discrete spectra, in agreement with observations.",

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

A negative value for $\\Delta G$ represents a driving force for the process in the forward direction, while a positive value represents a driving force for the process in the reverse direction. When $\\Delta G$ is zero, the forward and reverse driving forces are equal, and the process occurs in both directions at the same rate (the system is at equilibrium).\n\nIn the section on equilibrium, the reaction quotient, $Q$, was introduced as a convenient measure of the status of an equilibrium system. Recall that $Q$ is the numerical value of the mass action expression for the system, and that you may use its value to identify the direction in which a reaction will proceed in order to achieve equilibrium. When $Q$ is lesser than the equilibrium constant, $K$, the reaction will proceed in the forward direction until equilibrium is reached and $Q=K$. Conversely, if $Q>K$, the process will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is achieved.\n\nThe free energy change for a process taking place with reactants and products present under nonstandard conditions (pressures other than 1 bar; concentrations other than 1 M ) is related to the standard free energy change, according to this equation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G=\\Delta G^{\\circ}+R T \\ln Q\n$$\n\n$R$ is the gas constant ( $8.314 \\mathrm{~J} / \\mathrm{K} \\mathrm{mol}$ ), $T$ is the kelvin or absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

The Second Law of Thermodynamics - \nIn the quest to identify a property that may reliably predict the spontaneity of a process, a promising candidate has been identified: entropy. Processes that involve an increase in entropy of the system ( $\\Delta S>0$ ) are very often spontaneous; however, examples to the contrary are plentiful. By expanding consideration of entropy changes to include the surroundings, we may reach a significant conclusion regarding the relation between this property and spontaneity. In thermodynamic models, the system and surroundings comprise everything, that is, the universe, and so the following is true:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text {univ }}=\\Delta S_{\\text {sys }}+\\Delta S_{\\text {surr }}\n$$\n\nTo illustrate this relation, consider again the process of heat flow between two objects, one identified as the system and the other as the surroundings. There are three possibilities for such a process:\n\n1. The objects are at different temperatures, and heat flows from the hotter to the cooler object. This is always observed to occur spontaneously. Designating the hotter object as the system and invoking the definition of entropy yields the following:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{sys}}=\\frac{-q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T_{\\mathrm{sys}}} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{surr}}=\\frac{q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T_{\\mathrm{surr}}}\n$$\n\nThe magnitudes of $-q_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ and $q_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are equal, their opposite arithmetic signs denoting loss of heat by the system and gain of heat by the surroundings.

The Ideal Gas Law - \nTo this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of the gas:\n\n- Boyle's law: $P V=$ constant at constant $T$ and $n$\n- Amontons's law: $\\frac{P}{T}=$ constant at constant $V$ and $n$\n- Charles's law: $\\frac{V}{T}=$ constant at constant $P$ and $n$\n- Avogadro's law: $\\frac{V}{n}=$ constant at constant $P$ and $T$\n\nCombining these four laws yields the ideal gas law, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas:\n\n$$\nP V=n R T\n$$\n\nwhere $P$ is the pressure of a gas, $V$ is its volume, $n$ is the number of moles of the gas, $T$ is its temperature on the kelvin scale, and $R$ is a constant called the ideal gas constant or the universal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by dimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being $0.08206 \\mathrm{~L} \\mathrm{~atm} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and 8.314 kPa L $\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$.\n\nGases whose properties of $P, V$, and $T$ are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit ideal behavior or to approximate the traits of an ideal gas. An ideal gas is a hypothetical construct that may be used along with kinetic molecular theory to effectively explain the gas laws as will be described in a later module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final module of this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the non-ideal behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures.",

Pressure and Temperature: Amontons's Law - \nGuillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature of a gas ( $\\sim 1700$ ), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely (~1800). Because of this, the $P$ - $T$ relationship for gases is known as either Amontons's law or Gay-Lussac's law. Under either name, it states that the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant. Mathematically, this can be written:\n\n$$\nP \\propto T \\text { or } P=\\text { constant } \\times T \\text { or } P=k \\times T\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$ means \"is proportional to,\" and $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the identity, amount, and volume of the gas.\n\nFor a confined, constant volume of gas, the ratio $\\frac{P}{T}$ is therefore constant (i.e., $\\frac{P}{T}=k$ ). If the gas is initially in \"Condition 1\" (with $P=P_{1}$ and $T=T_{1}$ ), and then changes to \"Condition 2\" (with $P=P_{2}$ and $T=T_{2}$ ), we have that $\\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=k$ and $\\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}=k$, which reduces to $\\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=\\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}$. This equation is useful for pressure-temperature calculations for a confined gas at constant volume. Note that temperatures must be on the kelvin scale for any gas law calculations ( 0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature is called absolute zero). (Also note that there are at least three ways we can describe how the pressure of a gas changes as its temperature changes: We can use a table of values, a graph, or a mathematical equation.)",

Avogadro's Law Revisited - \nSometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure.\n\nWe can extend Avogadro's law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to $\\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$, a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.\n\nThe explanation for this is illustrated in Figure 8.23. According to Avogadro's law, equal volumes of gaseous $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ reacts with three molecules of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to produce two molecules of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, the volume of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ required is three times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, and the volume of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ produced is two times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.23 One volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ combines with three volumes of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to form two volumes of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.",

In fact, its $\\pi$ electrons are localized into four double bonds rather than delocalized around the ring, and the molecule is tub-shaped rather than planar. It has no cyclic conjugation because neighboring $p$ orbitals don't have the necessary parallel alignment for overlap, and it resembles an open-chain polyene in its reactivity.\n\n\n\nX-ray studies show that the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ single bonds in cyclooctatetraene are 147 pm long and the double bonds are 134 pm long.

When the energy levels of molecular orbitals for cyclic conjugated molecules are calculated, it turns out that there is always a single lowest-lying MO, above which the MOs come in degenerate pairs. Thus, when electrons fill the various molecular orbitals, it takes two electrons, or one pair, to fill the lowest-lying orbital and four electrons, or two pairs, to fill each of $n$ succeeding energy levels-a total of $4 n+2$.

The Quantum-Mechanical Model of an Atom - \nShortly after de Broglie published his ideas that the electron in a hydrogen atom could be better thought of as being a circular standing wave instead of a particle moving in quantized circular orbits, Erwin Schrödinger extended de Broglie's work by deriving what is today known as the Schrödinger equation. When Schrödinger applied his equation to hydrogen-like atoms, he was able to reproduce Bohr's expression for the energy and, thus, the Rydberg formula governing hydrogen spectra. Schrödinger described electrons as three-dimensional stationary waves, or wavefunctions, represented by the Greek letter psi, $\\psi$. A few years later, Max Born proposed an interpretation of the wavefunction $\\psi$ that is still accepted today: Electrons are still particles, and so the waves represented by $\\psi$ are not physical waves but, instead, are complex probability amplitudes. The square of the magnitude of a wavefunction $|\\psi|^{2}$ describes the probability of the quantum particle being present near a certain location in space. This means that wavefunctions can be used to determine the distribution of the electron's density with respect to the nucleus in an atom. In the most general form, the Schrödinger equation can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{H} \\psi=E \\psi\n$$\n\n$\\widehat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, a set of mathematical operations representing the total energy of the quantum particle (such as an electron in an atom), $\\psi$ is the wavefunction of this particle that can be used to find the special distribution of the probability of finding the particle, and $E$ is the actual value of the total energy of the particle.\n\nSchrödinger's work, as well as that of Heisenberg and many other scientists following in their footsteps, is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.",

Remember that even in a small sample there are a huge number of atoms (typically $>10^{23}$ atoms), and therefore a huge number of atomic orbitals that may be combined into molecular orbitals. When $N$ valence atomic orbitals, all of the same energy and each containing one (1) electron, are combined, $N / 2$ (filled) bonding orbitals and $N / 2$ (empty) antibonding orbitals will result.

The antibonding orbitals will show an increase in energy as the atomic orbitals are mostly out-of-phase, but each of the antibonding orbitals will also be a little different and have slightly different energies. The allowed energy levels for all the bonding orbitals are so close together that they form a band, called the valence band.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital.

You might recall from your general chemistry course that, according to the quantum mechanical model, the behavior of a specific electron in an atom can be described by a mathematical expression called a wave equation-the same type of expression used to describe the motion of waves in a fluid. The solution to a wave equation is called a wave function, or orbital, and is denoted by the lowercase Greek letter psi ( $\\psi$ ).\nWhen the square of the wave function, $\\psi^{2}$, is plotted in three-dimensional space, an orbital describes the volume of space around a nucleus that an electron is most likely to occupy. You might therefore think of an orbital as looking like a photograph of the electron taken at a slow shutter speed. In such a photo, the orbital would appear as a blurry cloud, indicating the region of space where the electron has been. This electron cloud doesn't have a sharp boundary, but for practical purposes we can set the limits by saying that an orbital represents the space where an electron spends $90 \\%$ to $95 \\%$ of its time.\n\nWhat do orbitals look like? There are four different kinds of orbitals, denoted $s, p, d$, and $f$, each with a different shape. Of the four, we'll be concerned primarily with $s$ and $p$ orbitals because these are the most common in\norganic and biological chemistry. An $s$ orbital has a spherical shape, with the nucleus at its center; a $p$ orbital has a dumbbell shape with two parts, or lobes; and four of the five $d$ orbitals have a cloverleaf shape with four lobes, as shown in FIGURE 1.4. The fifth $d$ orbital is shaped like an elongated dumbbell with a doughnut around its middle.\n\n\nAn $s$ orbital\n\n\nA p orbital\n\n\nAd orbital\n\nFIGURE 1.4 Representations of $\\boldsymbol{s}, \\boldsymbol{p}$, and $\\boldsymbol{d}$ orbitals.

Understanding Quantum Theory of Electrons in Atoms - \nThe goal of this section is to understand the electron orbitals (location of electrons in atoms), their different energies, and other properties. The use of quantum theory provides the best understanding to these topics. This knowledge is a precursor to chemical bonding.\n\nAs was described previously, electrons in atoms can exist only on discrete energy levels but not between them. It is said that the energy of an electron in an atom is quantized, that is, it can be equal only to certain specific values and can jump from one energy level to another but not transition smoothly or stay between these levels.\n\nThe energy levels are labeled with an $n$ value, where $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$. Generally speaking, the energy of an electron in an atom is greater for greater values of $n$. This number, $n$, is referred to as the principal quantum number. The principal quantum number defines the location of the energy level. It is essentially the same concept as the $n$ in the Bohr atom description. Another name for the principal quantum number is the shell number. The shells of an atom can be thought of concentric circles radiating out from the nucleus. The electrons that belong to a specific shell are most likely to be found within the corresponding circular area. The further we proceed from the nucleus, the higher the shell number, and so the higher the energy level (Figure 3.19). The positively charged protons in the nucleus stabilize the electronic orbitals by electrostatic attraction\nbetween the positive charges of the protons and the negative charges of the electrons. So the further away the electron is from the nucleus, the greater the energy it has.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.19 Different shells are numbered by principal quantum numbers.\nThis quantum mechanical model for where electrons reside in an atom can be used to look at electronic transitions, the events when an electron moves from one energy level to another. If the transition is to a higher energy level, energy is absorbed, and the energy change has a positive value. To obtain the amount of energy necessary for the transition to a higher energy level, a photon is absorbed by the atom. A transition to a lower energy level involves a release of energy, and the energy change is negative. This process is accompanied by emission of a photon by the atom. The following equation summarizes these relationships and is based on the hydrogen atom:",

None of the orbitals points directly at the tetrahedral ligands. However, the $e_{g}$ set (along the Cartesian axes) overlaps with the ligands less than does the $t_{2 g}$ set. By analogy with the octahedral case, predict the energy diagram for the $d$ orbitals in a tetrahedral crystal field. To avoid confusion, the octahedral $e_{g}$ set becomes a tetrahedral e set, and the octahedral $t_{2 g}$ set becomes a $t_{2}$ set.\n\n\nFIGURE 19.36 This diagram shows the orientation of the tetrahedral ligands with respect to the axis system for the orbitals.",

Although the cross-section of one strand is almost impossible to see without a microscope, it is huge on an atomic scale. A single carbon atom in the web has a diameter of about 0.000000015 centimeter, and it would take about 7000 carbon atoms to span the diameter of the strand. To put this in perspective, if a carbon atom were the size of a dime, the cross-section of one strand would be larger than a football field, which would require about 150 million carbon atom \"dimes\" to cover it.

This procedure is called the Aufbau principle, from the German word Aufbau (\"to build up\"). Each added electron occupies the subshell of lowest energy available (in the order shown in Figure 3.24), subject to the limitations imposed by the allowed quantum numbers according to the Pauli exclusion principle. Electrons enter higher-energy subshells only after lower-energy subshells have been filled to capacity. Figure 3.26 illustrates the traditional way to remember the filling order for atomic orbitals. Since the arrangement of the periodic table is based on the electron configurations, Figure 3.27 provides an alternative method for determining the electron configuration. The filling order simply begins at hydrogen and includes each subshell as you proceed in increasing $Z$ order. For example, after filling the $3 p$ block up to Ar, we see the orbital will be $4 \\mathrm{~s}(\\mathrm{~K}, \\mathrm{Ca})$, followed by the $3 d$ orbitals.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.26 This diagram depicts the energy order for atomic orbitals and is useful for deriving ground-state electron configurations.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.27 This partial periodic table shows electron configurations for the valence subshells of atoms.

Carbon is the key additive to iron in the steelmaking process, and diamonds have a unique place in both culture and industry. With all this usage came significant study, particularly with the emergence of organic chemistry. And even with all the known forms and functions of the element, scientists began to uncover the potential for even more varied and extensive carbon structures.\n\nAs early as the 1960s, chemists began to observe complex carbon structures, but they had little evidence to support their concepts, or their work did not make it into the mainstream. Eiji Osawa predicted a spherical form based on observations of a similar structure, but his work was not widely known outside Japan. In a similar manner, the most comprehensive advance was likely computational chemist Elena Galpern's, who in 1973 predicted a highly stable, 60-carbon molecule; her work was also isolated to her native Russia. Still later, Harold Kroto, working with Canadian radio astronomers, sought to uncover the nature of long carbon chains that had been discovered in interstellar space.\n\nKroto sought to use a machine developed by Richard Smalley's team at Rice University to learn more about these structures. Together with Robert Curl, who had introduced them, and three graduate students-James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Yuan Liu-they performed an intensive series of experiments that led to a major discovery.\n\nIn 1996, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Richard Smalley (Figure 4.12), Robert Curl, and Harold Kroto for their work in discovering a new form of carbon, the $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$ buckminsterfullerene molecule (Figure 4.1). An entire class of compounds, including spheres and tubes of various shapes, were discovered based on $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$. This type of molecule, called a fullerene, shows promise in a variety of applications. Because of their size and shape, fullerenes can encapsulate other molecules, so they have shown potential in various applications from hydrogen storage to targeted drug delivery systems.

Bohr also assumed that electrons orbiting the nucleus normally do not emit or absorb electromagnetic radiation, but do so when the electron switches to a different orbit.

These wavefunctions, or orbitals, are three-dimensional stationary waves that can be specified by three quantum numbers that arise naturally from their underlying mathematics (no ad hoc assumptions required): the principal quantum number, $n$ (the same one used by Bohr), which specifies shells such that orbitals having the same $n$ all have the same energy and approximately the same spatial extent; the angular momentum quantum number 1 , which is a measure of the orbital's angular momentum and corresponds to the orbitals' general shapes, as well as specifying subshells such that orbitals having the same $l$ (and $n$ ) all have the same energy; and the orientation quantum number $m$, which is a measure of the $z$ component of the angular momentum and corresponds to the orientations of the orbitals. The Bohr model gives the same expression for the energy as the quantum mechanical expression and, hence, both properly account for hydrogen's discrete spectrum (an example of getting the right answers for the wrong reasons, something that many chemistry students can sympathize with), but gives the wrong expression for the angular momentum (Bohr orbits necessarily all have non-zero angular momentum, but some quantum orbitals [ $s$ orbitals] can have zero angular momentum).",

An atomic orbital is a general region in an atom within which an electron is most probable to reside. The quantum mechanical model specifies the probability of finding an electron in the three-dimensional space around the nucleus and is based on solutions of the Schrödinger equation. In addition, the principal quantum number defines the energy of an electron in a hydrogen or hydrogen-like atom or an ion (an atom or an ion with only one electron) and the general region in which discrete energy levels of electrons in a multi-electron atoms and ions are located.\n\nAnother quantum number is $l$, the secondary (angular momentum) quantum number. It is an integer that may take the values, $l=0,1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. This means that an orbital with $n=1$ can have only one value of $l, l=0$, whereas $n=2$ permits $l=0$ and $l=1$, and so on. Whereas the principal quantum number, $n$, defines the general size and energy of the orbital, the secondary quantum number 1 specifies the shape of the orbital.

Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result.

Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital.

Orbitals within the same subshell are still degenerate and have the same energy.\nWhile the three quantum numbers discussed in the previous paragraphs work well for describing electron orbitals, some experiments showed that they were not sufficient to explain all observed results. It was demonstrated in the 1920s that when hydrogen-line spectra are examined at extremely high resolution, some lines are actually not single peaks but, rather, pairs of closely spaced lines. This is the so-called fine structure of the spectrum, and it implies that there are additional small differences in energies of electrons even when they are located in the same orbital.

Orbital Energies and Atomic Structure - \nFIGURE 3.24 Generalized energy-level diagram for atomic orbitals in an atom with two or more electrons (not to scale).\n\nElectrons in successive atoms on the periodic table tend to fill low-energy orbitals first. Thus, many students find it confusing that, for example, the $5 p$ orbitals fill immediately after the $4 d$, and immediately before the $6 s$. The filling order is based on observed experimental results, and has been confirmed by theoretical calculations. As the principal quantum number, $n$, increases, the size of the orbital increases and the electrons spend more time farther from the nucleus. Thus, the attraction to the nucleus is weaker and the energy associated with the orbital is higher (less stabilized). But this is not the only effect we have to take into account. Within each shell, as the value of 1 increases, the electrons are less penetrating (meaning there is less electron density found close to the nucleus), in the order $s>p>d>f$. Electrons that are closer to the nucleus slightly repel electrons that are farther out, offsetting the more dominant electron-nucleus attractions slightly (recall\nthat all electrons have -1 charges, but nuclei have $+Z$ charges). This phenomenon is called shielding and will be discussed in more detail in the next section. Electrons in orbitals that experience more shielding are less stabilized and thus higher in energy. For small orbitals ( $1 s$ through $3 p$ ), the increase in energy due to $n$ is more significant than the increase due to $l$; however, for larger orbitals the two trends are comparable and cannot be simply predicted. We will discuss methods for remembering the observed order.\n\nThe arrangement of electrons in the orbitals of an atom is called the electron configuration of the atom.

The VSEPR model assumes that electron pairs in the valence shell of a central atom will adopt an arrangement that minimizes repulsions between these electron pairs by maximizing the distance between them. The electrons in the valence shell of a central atom form\neither bonding pairs of electrons, located primarily between bonded atoms, or lone pairs. The electrostatic repulsion of these electrons is reduced when the various regions of high electron density assume positions as far from each other as possible.\n\nVSEPR theory predicts the arrangement of electron pairs around each central atom and, usually, the correct arrangement of atoms in a molecule.

The Bohr Model\nBohr incorporated Planck's and Einstein's quantization ideas into a model of the hydrogen atom that resolved the paradox of atom stability and discrete spectra. The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom explains the connection between the quantization of photons and the quantized emission from atoms. Bohr described the hydrogen atom in terms of an electron moving in a circular orbit about a nucleus. He postulated that the electron was restricted to certain orbits characterized by discrete energies. Transitions between these allowed orbits result in the absorption or emission of photons. When an electron moves from a higher-energy orbit to a more stable one, energy is emitted in the form of a photon. To move an electron from a stable orbit to a more excited one, a photon of energy must be absorbed. Using the Bohr model, we can calculate the energy of an electron and the radius of its orbit in any one-electron system.",

Electron-pair Geometry versus Molecular Structure - \nIt is important to note that electron-pair geometry around a central atom is not the same thing as its molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries shown in Figure 4.16 describe all regions where electrons are located, bonds as well as lone pairs. Molecular structure describes the location of the atoms, not the electrons.\n\nWe differentiate between these two situations by naming the geometry that includes all electron pairs the electron-pair geometry. The structure that includes only the placement of the atoms in the molecule is called the molecular structure. The electron-pair geometries will be the same as the molecular structures when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom, but they will be different when there are lone pairs present on the central atom.\n\nFor example, the methane molecule, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, which is the major component of natural gas, has four bonding pairs of electrons around the central carbon atom; the electron-pair geometry is tetrahedral, as is the molecular structure (Figure 4.17). On the other hand, the ammonia molecule, $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, also has four electron pairs associated with the nitrogen atom, and thus has a tetrahedral electron-pair geometry. One of these regions, however, is a lone pair, which is not included in the molecular structure, and this lone pair influences the shape of the molecule (Figure 4.18).\n\n\nFIGURE 4.17 The molecular structure of the methane molecule, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, is shown with a tetrahedral arrangement of the hydrogen atoms.

Determine the total number of valence (outer shell) electrons. The sum of the valence electrons is 5 (from $\\mathrm{N})+6($ from O$)=11$. The odd number immediately tells us that we have a free radical, so we know that not every atom can have eight electrons in its valence shell.\n2. Draw a skeleton structure of the molecule. We can easily draw a skeleton with an N-O single bond: N-O\n3. Distribute the remaining electrons as lone pairs on the terminal atoms. In this case, there is no central atom, so we distribute the electrons around both atoms. We give eight electrons to the more electronegative atom in these situations; thus oxygen has the filled valence shell:\n\n4. Place all remaining electrons on the central atom. Since there are no remaining electrons, this step does not apply.\n5. Rearrange the electrons to make multiple bonds with the central atom in order to obtain octets wherever possible. We know that an odd-electron molecule cannot have an octet for every atom, but we want to get each atom as close to an octet as possible. In this case, nitrogen has only five electrons around it. To move closer to an octet for nitrogen, we take one of the lone pairs from oxygen and use it to form a NO double bond.

According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, the $p$ orbitals on the $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbons of a conjugated polyene interact to form a set of $\\pi$ molecular orbitals whose energies depend on the number of nodes they have between nuclei. Molecular orbitals with fewer nodes are lower in energy than isolated $p$ atomic orbitals and are bonding MOs; molecular orbitals with more nodes are higher in energy than isolated $p$ orbitals and are antibonding MOs. Pi molecular orbitals of ethylene and 1,3-butadiene are shown in FIGURE 30.2.\n\n\nA similar sort of molecular orbital description can be derived for any conjugated $\\pi$ electron system. 1,3,5-Hexatriene, for example, has three double bonds and six $\\pi$ MOs, as shown in FIGURE 30.3.

According to a series of rules formulated in the mid-1960s by R. B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann at Harvard University, a pericyclic reaction can take place only if the symmetries of the reactant MOs are the same as the symmetries of the product MOs. In other words, the lobes of reactant MOs must be of the correct algebraic sign for bonding to occur in the transition state leading to product.",

Behavior in the Microscopic World - \n$$\n2 \\pi r=n \\lambda, n=1,2,3, \\ldots\n$$\n\nShortly after de Broglie proposed the wave nature of matter, two scientists at Bell Laboratories, C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer, demonstrated experimentally that electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior by showing an interference pattern for electrons travelling through a regular atomic pattern in a crystal. The regularly spaced atomic layers served as slits, as used in other interference experiments. Since the spacing between the layers serving as slits needs to be similar in size to the wavelength of the tested wave for an interference pattern to form, Davisson and Germer used a crystalline nickel target for their \"slits,\" since the spacing of the atoms within the lattice was approximately the same as the de Broglie wavelengths of the electrons that they used. Figure 3.18 shows an interference pattern. It is strikingly similar to the interference patterns for light shown in Electromagnetic Energy for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits. The wave-particle duality of matter can be seen in Figure 3.18 by observing what happens if electron collisions are recorded over a long period of time. Initially, when only a few electrons have been recorded, they show clear particle-like behavior, having arrived in small localized packets that appear to be random. As more and more electrons arrived and were recorded, a clear interference pattern that is the hallmark of wavelike behavior emerged. Thus, it appears that while electrons are small localized particles, their motion does not follow the equations of motion implied by classical mechanics, but instead it is governed by some type of a wave equation. Thus the wave-particle duality first observed with photons is actually a fundamental behavior intrinsic to all quantum particles.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.18 (a) The interference pattern for electrons passing through very closely spaced slits demonstrates that quantum particles such as electrons can exhibit wavelike behavior.
