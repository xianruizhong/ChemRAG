[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14].

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

''Caged\" compounds are defined as relatively small molecules that can release substance of interest under the action of light. Several approaches to carry this functionality to long-wavelength region are known. However, this problem has no simple solution because typical organic bond dissociation energy is about 350-400 kJ/mol, which corresponds to a 340 nm UV light. Unfortunately, the energy of infrared photon is at least twice less. Therefore, one needs to either use the energy of multiple photons or somehow weaken the bond. Below, we describe several strategies to solve the problem. First section is devoted to a near-infrared PPGs which work through a direct single-photon photoprocess. Second section describes compounds with photorelease step that involves a reaction with singlet oxygen. In the third section, we give a brief overview of two-photon absorbing PPGs. Last section concludes the paper and gives references for further reading on connected topics, including photon upconversion-based photorelease technique.\n\n\nSingle-photon PPGs\n\nThe ''uncaging\" reaction implies the dissociation of covalent bond between PPG and leaving group (LG) and therefore requires energy. For a rough estimate the average bond energy can be used to calculate the photon wavelength needed for the dissociation. For instance, C-C and C-O bonds correspond to 320-350 nm light, slightly weaker C-N bond -up to 395 nm. This simple consideration shows why the majority of known PPGs works in the near-UV spectral region. However, the process is far from simple ''scission\" and often proceeds through several stages which typically include intramolecular electron or hydrogen atom transfer, rearrangements or cyclizations, and solvolysis.",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq.

We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq.

It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range.

As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data. We multiply KD single-particle β 2 = 0 differential cross sections by the respective SF of the model with the core excitation and compare with the KD(β 2 = 0.5) results fully including the core excitation. The difference between these two results, or the deviation of the ratio  The experimental data at E d = 21 MeV are from Ref.

We start with the excited state 1 2 + analysis in Fig. 4 where we expect some similarities with the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) case [12][13][14]. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref. [16].",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

A photon of 300 nm wavelength can in principle cleave most of the single bonds in a living cell, (O-H being the exception) through photoelectron ejection for example. XPS studies of damage induced by UV radiation on DNA [8] report release of CO and nitrogen based compounds through bond breakage, for energies above 4.2 eV. As the treatment wavelength lengthens however, fewer and fewer bond groups B, 2015, 119 (17), pp 5404-5411are at high risk of damage by individual photons. Broadly speaking however, one might expect that the relatively weak C-N bond (3.12 eV) that binds amino acids together and ties nucleic acids to the phosphate backbone, to still be vulnerable. This bond energy is represented by a violet photon of about 400 nm wavelength. Because nucleic acid integrity and protein stability are both essential conditions for living organisms, we chose conveniently available 300 nm and 405 nm light sources for treatment investigations in this study. To investigate changes in the structure of the E.coli cells, Raman spectroscopy was chosen because of its low sensitivity to the presence of water, sharp spectral features, well documented Raman spectra database for biological molecules [9,10] and ease of sample preparation. The method has previously been used to identify single bacteria cells [11,12], determine their chemical composition [13,14] and compare different strains of bacteria [15,16]. Raman spectroscopy has been applied to monitor the action of antibiotics to resistant and non-resistant bacterial strains [17,18] but to our knowledge, has yet to be used to monitor changes in bacterial molecular vibration spectra and hence structure, due to treatment with light or other electromagnetic radiation.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nBacteria Preparation",

J is coupled with the nuclear spin of H (I = 1/2) to give the grand total angular momentum, F. The calculations of the state-to-state rotationally inelastic rates have been carried out for the collisions of the CH neutral molecule with He atoms 9 for a variety of changes of the lower quantum numbers and over a range of temperatures up to 300 K. It turned out that all such rates were practically negligible at the lowest temperatures and reached their largest values of ≈10 −13 cm 3 s −1 only above about 200 K. Such values are therefore more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than those we have obtained for the present anion, the CH − partner, in the same temperature range relevant for the ISM conditions. This finding thus confirms the essentially marginal significance of the collision-driven rotational state changes induced in CH by the He present in these environments. The comparison also clearly confirms the much larger rate coefficients which occur in collisions involving charged molecular partners as opposed to the neutral ones. As mentioned earlier, we have extended the comparison of the present calculations, which now use the correct PES to describe the interaction between the partners of the present system, to another molecular anion of similar structure, the C 2 H − negative ion, for which we had done earlier accurate calculations already reported in the literature. 14 The results of the present comparisons are reported in the panels of Figures 9 and 10.\n\nThe results reported by the two last figures essentially confirm what we had already found in the study we are correcting here: the CH − anion exhibits the smallest excitation/de-excitation efficiency from collisions with the He partner in comparison with both CN − , which shows the largest excitation/cooling efficiency by collisions, and the C 2 H − system, which is somewhere in between, although much closer to the behavior of the CN − partner.\n\n\n■ PRESENT CONCLUSIONS: ASSESSING THE",

The first term is the scalar part, and is not significant for the problem of the singlet-triplet bottleneck. The second term in the above equation, V 2 = l |l > V so l (r)L.S < l| introduces mixing between orbital and spin angular momentum states, leading to the break down of the usual spin selection rules. However, the full inclusion of the spin-orbit term in first-principles CI calculations of the type discussed in this paper is numerically quite prohibitive, given the large number of electrons which need to be handled in typical LED materials. Leave aside CI calculations, the numerical evaluation even with a pseudopotential scheme is extremely demanding. [13] The spin-orbit operator is highly local in the sense that it is mostly sensitive to changes in electron density close to the nucleus, where relativistic effects dominate. Thus we may look at calculations for systems containing As as a guide. In order to get at least a simple \"grosso modo\" estimate, we may compare the homo-lumo gap (bandgap) of As obtained from a non-relativistic (i.e, standard) calculation with a calculation where some effort is put into an evaluation of the relativistic effects. [14] Thus Gonze et al. have carried out calculations which can be used for a simple estimate of the effect of the spin-orbit effect in As. The s-levels in As are about 9 eV lower than the p-levels. The p-levels suffer a splitting of about 0.36 eV in As, and is a measure of the strength of the spin-orbit term in As. Since we are concerned with singlet and triplet excitons, we should compare this spin-orbit splitting with the gap between hole energies and the Fermi energy, and electron energies and the Fermi energy in As. Numerical values for these, for As have been given by J.-P. Issi, [15], and by Priestly et al., [16]. Issi gives 0.154 eV and 0.202 eV for electrons and holes, while Priestly et al give 0.177 and 0.190 eV. Hence the total effect for an electron-hole pair is of the order of 0.35 eV by one estimate, and 0.36 eV by the second estimate. These numbers are",

In particular, J = N + S, where N is the orbital angular momentum; since the electronic orbital angular momentum is zero, N is identical to O, the nuclear orbital angular momentum. The rotational quantum number J can take the values J = N + S, N + S − 1, ..., N − S. Therefore, for oxygen in its vibronic ground state with S = 1, each level N is split into three levels with J = N − 1, N, N + 1, as is shown in Fig. 3. The splitting is stronger for low values of N . Additionally, for symmetry reasons, only odd values are allowed for N [42].\n\nFor the numerical treatment, we express the wave function as a linear combination of Hund's case (b) basis states [42,44]:\n|Ψ = JN M C JN M (t)e −iEJN t/ |ηΛ; N Λ; N SJM .

In more detail, the angular emission distributions and the final quantum state of electron B are obtained in our experiment by measuring the momenta of the charged particles generated by the photoionization process in coincidence.

OUTLOOK\n\nAn electron vortex [9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] in an electric field E might harbour a hidden momentum due to a modification of the electron's orbital motion by E, in addition to the spinbased hidden momentum identified in this paper. The orbital-based hidden momentum should take the form m × E/c 2 , with m the orbital magnetic-dipole moment of the electron. Assuming that |m | ∼ −qh| |/2m, this is < ∼ −qh| ||E|/2mc 2 = | ||E| × 10 −40 A.s 2 in magnitude. The orbital-based hidden momentum could be significantly larger than the spin-based hidden momentum (expectation value < ∼ −qh|E|/2mc 2 in magnitude), as the orbital angular momentum quantum number ∈ {0, ±1, . . . } is unbounded.\n\nInferring the existence of hidden momentum in the laboratory is an interesting problem. One might endeavour to measure the associated angular momentum, which is not necessarily cancelled by the angular momentum of the field that gives rise to the hidden momentum -unlike the total linear momentum, the total angular momentum of a system 'at rest' need not vanish [2]. An electron vortex with a large orbital angular momentum, perturbed by an electric field, might prove particularly suitable for this purpose.",

However, if theν e spin and the 14 N spin are aligned, conservation of angular momentum will require one additional unit of angular momentum to come from either theν e or the e + wave function in order for the total angular momentum on the right-hand side to equal the 3/2 on the left-hand side. This is known from basic nuclear physics  to introduce roughly an order of magnitude smaller cross section for the latter case compared to the former. However, this also introduces a parity change. Since the transition from 14 N to the 14 C ground state is between nuclear states of the same parity, two units of angular momentum must therefore come from the anti-neutrino and/or positron wave functions. Thus the inhibition may be closer to two orders of magnitude. This spin-dependent reaction probability is the origin of the effect predicted for the SNAAP model.\n\nDetailed quantum molecular calculations (Famiano et al., 2018a,b) have shown that the complex interactions of the molecules with the intense magnetic field of a neutron star or a two neutron star merger and the effective electric field caused by the motion of the meteoroids through the magnetic field, a result of the Lorentz force, do produce an environment that is truly chiral (Barron, 2008). In this situation, the interaction of the 14 N nuclei with theν e s is chirally selective, and will in many cases, destroy more of the right-handed amino acids than the left-handed ones .\n\nThe external magnetic field aligns the 14 N nuclei via their nuclear magnetic moments, whereas the effective electric field aligns the molecular electric dipole moments, which depend on the chirality. The external magnetic field, however, is modified at the nucleus by the effects of the orbital electrons, known as shielding.\n\nThis, in turn causes a chirality sensitive perturbation on the magnetic orientation of the nuclei, which leads to a chirality-dependent magnetization (a bulk property).",

The data in Fig. 1 indicate that, in some cases (boron, carbon, and oxygen), the application of such constraints reduces the error in the v2RDM energy by more than a factor of two. Moreover, angular momentum constraints also allow us to directly optimize 2-RDMs for excited states that are not otherwise accessible by v2RDM methods. Table II illustrates energy differences between excited spin and orbital angular momentum states and the ground electronic states for all second-row atoms, except lithium and neon. Note that all results tabulated under the heading \"L z \" correspond to the maximum orbital angular momentum projection. First, we consider those states that are accessible without angular momen-  Table II for which numerical values are given under the heading \"real\"). For the beryllium atom, the 1 S → 3 P transition is equally welldescribed by all combinations of angular momentum constraints considered. On the other hand, the description of every other transition energy is improved by the consideration of angular momentum constraints, sometimes dramatically so. In particular, the consideration ofL 2 symmetry improves the almost 1 eV error in the description of the 4 S → 2 D transition in nitrogen by 0.32 eV. The subsequent application of the constraint on L z reduces the error to only 0.15 eV.

In one case, the 4 S → 4 P transition in nitrogen, a constraint on the expectation value ofL 2 yields a terrible estimate of the excitation energy; it is too low by 5.78 eV. However, subsequent application of the constraint on L z yields an excitation energy that agrees with that from the full CI to within less than 0.01 eV. We also observe that the application of theL z constraint improves over the consideration of theL 2 constraint alone for the 4 S → 2 P transition in nitrogen, although the improvement is less dramatic in this case. On the other hand, it appears that the application of theL 2 constraint alone gives superior results to the application of bothL",

If the spins are aligned, the angular momentum of the combined 14 N(spin 1) + ῡ e (1/2) system must be 3/2, whereas if they are antialigned it will be ½. The transition produces 14 C(0) . Thus, since the weak interaction can be assumed to be point-like for the present situation, conservation of angular momentum in the aligned case requires some orbital angular momentum transfer. This can be =1 for the weak interaction, but this will inhibit the transition compared to that for the antialigned case, in which no orbital angular momentum transfer is required, by roughly an order of magnitude. Since the angular momentum coupling coefficients favor the case in which the spins of the 14 N and ῡ e are antialigned by 2:1 over that in which they are aligned, the antialigned 14 N nuclei will suffer selective destruction by roughly a factor of seven (two-thirds of the order of magnitude) over the aligned nuclei.

Finally, assuming that the same Morse potential describes the local binding of Muonium in the mioniated isopropyl radical, we are able to predict its width of momentum and position distributions and the kinetic and zero-point energy.

INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is well known that the application of a weak magnetic field can have a significant effect on the outcome of a radical pair recombination reaction. 1-6 But while this low field effect has been reproduced in theoretical calculations, 7-9 the mechanism that gives rise to it has yet to be fully explained. Timmel and co-workers have shown that applying a magnetic field lifts degeneracies among the zero field eigenstates of a radical pair with a single proton, and that this changes the time-dependent probability of finding the radical pair in the singlet state (S). 8 They also investigated a variety of other radical pairs containing more nuclear spins, with an emphasis on understanding the low field effect on the singlet yield of the recombination reaction. 8 However, they did not go on to investigate the more detailed question of how the magnetic field affects the time-dependent probability of finding the radical pair in each of the three triplet states (T + , T 0 and T − ).\n\nBrocklehurst and McLauchlan have attempted to infer the effect of a small magnetic field on these triplet state probabilities from the conservation of angular momentum, again for a radical pair containing just a single proton. 10 They argued as follows: (i) The total spin angular momentum quantum number of the radical pair in the singlet electronic state is J = 1/2, whereas in the triplet state J may be either 1/2 or 3/2. (ii) In the absence of a magnetic field, both J and M J are conserved, but once a field is applied only M J is conserved. (iii) This implies that the |J = 1/2, M J = ±1/2 → |J = 3/2, M J = ±1/2 transitions that are forbidden in the absence of the magnetic field become allowed when the field is switched on. (iv) These transitions lead to an increase in S → T ± interconversion. To quote directly from their paper: 10 \"The field first enables spin evolution of the singlet to at least some of the hyperfine states of the T ± levels to occur\".",

Since the g factor for protons is g = 2μ p /β N = 5.586, the Bohr magneton for nuclear protons is β N = 2μ p /5.586 = 4.87x10 -10 esu.

As a result, the spin quantum number exhibited by the two protons in a water molecule was found to be I = 1 from the dipole moment of water. Furthermore, the nuclear spin angular momentum (I) exhibited by the protons of water was calculated as I = I(I +1) 1/2 = 1.41. In the case of H 2 , the electric quadrupole moment (Θ) has been reported to be Θ H2 = 0.60×10 −26 esu.

There is a certain freedom in determining the parameters for the GLO, which results in some uncertainty of the magnitude of the GLO in the enhancement region. As the GLO gives only a minor contribution to the total strength below E γ = 2 MeV, an acceptable modification of the parameters will not remove the exponential enhancement caused by the M 1 radiation. It will change the values around 2 MeV, leaving room for other possible enhancement mechanisms. The comparison suggests that at least part of the low-energy enhancement in the experimental dipole strength functions can be explained by M 1 transitions in the quasi-continuum of states. The analogous low-energy enhancement predicted for 90 Zr suggests an experimental study of this nuclide. The re-coupling of spins leading to large B(M 1) values has been discussed in connection with high-spin multiplets (see, e.g. Refs. [23,24,25,26]). An analogous mechanism generates the \"shears bands\" manifesting \"magnetic rotation\" [34], which was also observed in the mass-90 region [35,25]. The \"mixed-symmetry\" configurations of the interacting boson model arise also from a reorientation of the proton angular momentum with respect to the neutron one. All these phenomena appear in nuclei near closed shells, if there are active high-j proton and neutron orbits near the Fermi surface with magnetic moments adding up coherently. Because these conditions are also prerequisites for the low-energy enhancement, one may expect it to appear in the same nuclei as the phenomena just mentioned. For example, the mixed-symmetry configurations discussed for 94 Mo [28,29] and 96 Mo [30,31] correspond to the dominating configurations π(0g 2 9/2 )ν(1d x 5/2 ) (x = 2, 3, 4 for 94,95,96 Mo, respectively) that were found causing large B(M 1) strengths in the present calculations.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn systems with well-defined orbital angular momentum symmetry, the application of orbital angular momentum constraints facilitates the direct variational determination of 2-RDMs for multiple electronic states. Moreover, without such considerations, the v2RDM approach cannot qualitatively describe states with non-zero z-projection of the orbital angular momentum, even if the state in question is the lowest-energy state of a given spin symmetry. Indeed, we demonstrated that, in the absence of orbital angular momentum constraints, the v2RDM approach incorrectly predicts that the ground state of molecular oxygen (described by the cc-pVDZ basis set) is a singlet. The application of appropriate constraints, which necessitates the consideration of complex-valued RDMs, recovers the correct spin-state ordering.\n\nThe v2RDM energy appears to be a convex function of the expectation value ofL z , and, for a given magnitude of the orbital angular momentum, maximal orbital angular momentum projection states are the most well-constrained. This result reveals a qualitative failure of v2RDM methods: they do not to recover the correct degeneracy for different L/M L states, at least when the RDMs satisfy the ensemble N -representability conditions considered in this work. This behavior suggests that the conclusions of Ref. 33 regarding the description of dif-ferent spin projection states apply to angular momentum projection states in general.

In the language of the rotation group, if one considers the two reactants to have proton nuclear spins of I 1 and I 2 , the combined spin state can be written as D I 1 ⊗ D I 2 . This state leads to the intermediate state D I 1 +I 2 ⊕ D I 1 +I 2 −1 ⊕ · · · ⊕ D |I 1 −I 2 | , which means that the complex can have total proton spin angular moment ranging from I 1 + I 2 down to |I 1 − I 2 |. Each of these angular momenta can then dissociate into product spin states given by angular momentum rules (Oka 2004). The approach of Oka is most valid for processes in which many rotational states of the products can be produced. These processes can be exothermic reactions or even thermoneutral reactions if the energy is sufficiently high. In this limit, one need not worry much about the rotational quantum number J, since many different J states are produced. For low-temperature thermoneutral processes, on the other hand, where a small number of J states may be produced, the role of the individual J states needs to be taken into account in a comprehensive quasi-phase-space theoretical approach (Herbst 1982;Gerlich 1990;Gerlich & Schlemmer 2002). Although the approach of Oka (2004) lends itself naturally to the idea of a reaction intermediate in which all protons are indistinguishable from one another and can be facilely exchanged during the life of the complex, it is also possible to remove this assumption. In fact, in our use of the treatment for the ion H + 3 , we assume that the protonation reactions occur by simple transfer of a proton rather than formation of a complex consisting of C 3 H 2 and H + 3 .

In the NLMO analysis, the summation over unoccupied orbitals is absorbed into the contributions from each occupied NLMO aer transforming the occupied CMO set to the NLMOs. Both the OZ and PSO matrix elements involve orbital angular momentum operators, because the associated magnetic moments are proportional to the angular momentum (for closed-shell molecules with light elements, the electron spin magnetic moments do not contribute to the shielding).

Therefore, the PSO operators mainly sample the electronic structure around the nucleus of interest.

Since the resulting exchange of linear momentum and spin angular momentum is asymmetric with respect to forward and backward SPPs, the particle experiences a lateral nonequilibrium Casimir force (F y ) transverse We illustrate nonequilibrium lateral Casimir force and torque on an isotropic dipolar nanoparticle in the near field of a doped InSb slab placed in magnetic field parallel to its surface. We assume B = 1T is applied along x axis of the geometry and clarify the asymmetric interaction of the particle with nonreciprocal SPPs of the slab along y axis (Voigt configuration). The asymmetric dispersion shown in the inset reveals the unequal magnitude of linear momentum for forward and backward SPPs of equal frequency. The SPPs also carry transverse spin angular momentum locked to their momentum as displayed. When the particle's temperature Tp is different from the temperature Te of the rest of the system, the net exchange of linear and spin angular momentum via fluctuations-generated photons is asymmetric with respect to forward and backward SPPs causing a lateral force transverse to applied field (Fy) and a lateral torque parallel to applied field (Mx).",

In systems possessing well-defined orbital angular momentum symmetry (i.e., atoms and linear molecules), the application of appropriate orbital angular momentum constraints allows for the direct description of multiple electronic states with different spatial symmetries. The application of v2RDM techniques to atomic states with non-zero magnitude and zprojection of the orbital angular momentum requires the consideration of complex-valued reduced-density matrices (RDMs). While atomic states with non-zero magnitude and zero z-projection of the orbital angular momentum can be described with real-valued RDMs, we show that the quality of the energy is inferior to that corresponding to non-zero z-projection states. This behavior is reminiscent of that observed for different spin angular momentum projection states in Ref. 33. For linear molecular systems, we demonstrate that angular momentum constraints and complex RDMs can be necessary for even a qualitatively correct description of the electronic structure; for example, in a correlation-consistent polarized valence double-zeta (cc-pVDZ) [34] basis set, a real-valued v2RDM computation incorrectly predicts that the lowest-energy state of molecular oxygen is a singlet. This paper is organized as follows. Section II outlines the general procedure for the direct determination of the 2-RDM under ensemble N -representability conditions and describes how one can incorporate orbital angular momentum constraints into the optimization.

The Mg-NH energy surface is anisotropic, providing significant couplings between the predissociating and continuum states.The rotational structure of NH exhibits fine structure due to the coupling of the molecular spin s to the rotational angular momentum n.

In order to analyse further the mechanism that leads to a smaller separation region in the suction side of the fractal blades, the streamlines around both types of blades are illustrated in Figure 6. To generate the streamlines, the radial velocity component is subtracted from the mean flow field and only the mean axial and azimuthal components are used. In other words, the effect of radial jet is not illustrated in these figures. The streamlines are coloured according to V θ . As seen in Figure 6  We can conclude that the pressure distribution on the suction side of blades is determined by the trailing vortex structures that emerge in the flow separated wake region.\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\nThe wake properties are therefore strongly affected by the blade design. This opens the possibility to design blades with favourable characteristics that reduce the drag coefficient and impeller torque, without changing the total area. \n\n\nTransport of angular momentum\n\nAs a result of the above differences in the pressure distribution on the blade surfaces, the regular impeller applies a higher torque to the volume of fluid in the vessel compared to the fractal impeller at Re = 1600. Therefore, the flux of angular momentum away from the impeller must be higher. Some questions naturally arise: Which differences in the flow field around the impeller result in the higher angular momentum flux? How is this related to the modification in the blade shape or in the trailing vortex system? In this section we try to answer these questions.\n\nTo this end, we consider a control volume (CV) around the impeller as shown in Figure   8 and compute the angular momentum balance in this CV. The impeller can be thought of as a source of angular momentum which is then transported through the borders of the CV and is eventually lost at the tank walls due to viscous stresses. 2",

In the particle's rest frame in horizontal plane, its rate of change approximates to\nω = − G − 1 γ 2 − 1 β E(4)\nIdeally it is possible to freeze the horizontal spin precession with respect to the velocity by injecting the beam with a specific energy, determined by γ 0 = √ 1/G + 1 from Equation 4. This is the basic idea of \"frozen spin method\" [1,4,5]. For protons, this condition can be satisfied with 0 ≈ 0 7 GeV/c, coined as \"magic momentum\". In practice there will be a momentum spread around the magic momentum. Besides, almost all particles make betatron oscillations due to transverse velocity and their transverse offset at the time of injection. Nevertheless, their momentum can be made to oscillate around the magic value by using an RF cavity, so that the average spin of the beam oscillates horizontally around the momentum vector [6]. There is still a tiny drift coming from the uncorrected second order term. This tiny drift eventually makes the radial spin component to grow as much as a radian within the so-called \"spin coherence time\". As a consequence, spin decoherence comes with off-magic momentum.\n\nThe first term of Equation 2 shows that under a vertical electric field, the off-magic momentum particles will grow a vertical spin component as well. In the storage ring EDM experiment, this scenario can be encountered as a result of misalignment of electrostatic elements like deflectors, quadrupoles, etc [8].

Here, s and l also couple to the nuclear orbital angular momentum, L, giving rise to the additional spin-orbit splitting observed. 48 Even after decades of attention, the combination of cutting-edge experimental investigations and state-of-the-art theory work has unveiled previously hidden features in the benchmark F + H 2 reaction system. 47 The identification of a range of other quantum effectsincluding quantum interference and geometric phase effects in H + HD -H 2 + D, and Feschbach resonances in the F + H 2 O -HF + OH reaction-further highlights the importance of precise experimental measurements and high-level theory work in deepening our understanding of radical reaction dynamics.

Moreover, the energy decreases more rapidly for the state with larger orbital angular momentum l and hence lead to the crossing phenomenon appearing in the resonance levels. For the spin doublets (2f 7/2 , 2f 5/2 ) and (3p 3/2 , 3p 1/2 ), variation of energy with neutron number is similar due to the same centrifugal potential, while their energy differences are attributed to the spin-orbit potential. This isotopic trend for the resonance energy and width are similar to those without the Coulomb exchange term [59]. For better understanding the influence of the Coulomb exchange term on the resonance parameters, the differences of resonance energies and widths calculated with and without the Coulomb exchange term are shown in Fig. 3 for Sn isotopes. It is found that the single proton resonance energies and widths of Sn isotopes are reduced when the Coulomb exchange term is phenomenologically taken into account. The difference of the resonance energy caused by the Coulomb exchange term only slightly increases with the increasing neutron number, which is within the range of 0.4 − 0.6 MeV, although the resonance energy spans from 4.643 MeV (2f 7/2 in 124 Sn) to 9.187 MeV (2f 5/2 in 114 Sn).

Our implementation not only enables single-point total energy and electronic-structure calculations but also provides access to atomic forces and stresses, hence allowing for full structure relaxations of periodic systems. Furthermore, our implementation allows one to deal with non-collinear spin texture, with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect treated self-consistently. The key aspect behind our implementation is a suitable definition of the correlated subspace when multiple atomic orbitals with the same angular momentum are used, and this is addressed via the \"Mullken charge projector\" constructed in terms of the first (most localized) atomic orbital within the d/f angular momentum channel. The important Hubbard U and Hund J parameters can be estimated from a screened Coulomb potential of the Yukawa type, with the screening parameter either chosen semi-empirically or determined from the Thomas-Fermi screening model. Benchmark calculations are performed for four late transition metal monoxide bulk systems, i.e., MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO, and for the 5d-electron compounds IrO2. For the former type of systems, we check the performance of our DFT+U implementation for calculating band gaps, magnetic moments, electronic band structures, as well as forces and stresses; for the latter, the efficacy of our DFT+U +SOC implementation is assessed. Systematic comparisons with available experimental results, and especially with the results from other implementation schemes are carried out, which demonstrate the validity of our NAO-based DFT+U formalism and implementation.\n\nI.

In each case, a centrifugal term B(r) ( + 1) was added to the potential, where B(r) =h 2 /2μr 2 [95,96], to give a rate k (2) thermally averaged over vibrational modes for the given angular momentum quantum number and associated partition function Z . Finally, rates were summed over the angular momentum quantum number, , and weighted by the degeneracy, to give the total thermal rate k (2) Figure 3a shows the contributions from the various terms evaluated using the exact quantum expressions, as well as via SCI theory and harmonic transition-state theory. The instanton approximation leads to a slight overprediction of the rates, whereas the hTST results are orders of magnitude too small. In both cases, however, it can be seen that for this diatomic there is little deviation between the predictions based on summing over angular momentum quantum numbers, and those based on the rigid-rotor approximation. In polyatomic molecules, the situation is expected to be even more favourable, as the moments of inertia are typically larger and do not change considerably along the tunnelling pathway. Note that the effective rotational constant in the instanton picture is B SCI = 1.89 meV, whereas for hTST it is given by the value at the MECP, B hTST = 1.52 meV. As the predicted total thermal rate is inversely proportional to this value, the agreement with the quantum results has been improved by using B SCI instead of B hTST .\nZ R = (2 + 1)k (2) Z , where Z R = (2 + 1)Z .",

Therefore, the SAM-and OAM-resolved band structures are computed for TaSi 2 along the selected k-paths where S z (k) and L z (k) are non-zero.As shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S1, the chiral crystalline symmetries and strong SOC in TaSi 2 result in a large spin-splitting of the bands.We found that the spin-split bands carry the opposite SAM but approximately the same OAM.This induces the spin and orbital polarization as electrons move through the chiral crystal and generally a larger magnitude of P L z than P S z in the presence of current flow.At the charge neutral point, the calculated P S z and P L z in TaSi 2 is -0.57% and 7.95%, respectively.",

Each of these rotational levels (N K a K c displayed in Fig. 1) splits into three finestructure levels due to spin-spin and spin-rotation interactions. Furthermore, CH 2 contains two identical protons, each with a nuclear spin, I H = 1/2, and, consequently, has two nuclear-spin isomers: ortho (I tot = 1) and para (I tot = 0). With a total hydrogenic nuclear spin I tot of unity, each of the three fine-structure levels of ortho-CH 2 further splits into three hyperfine structure (HFS) levels with total angular quantum number, F, of J − 1, J, and J + 1 for J 0, while para-CH 2 states with I tot = 0 do not have any HFS splitting. respectively (which show additional HFS splitting). The corresponding frequencies and spectroscopic parameters of all the studied HFS transitions are summarised in Table 1. In addition to the HFS lines listed, with regard to the ortho-CH 2 rotational transitions, for every J → J − 1 fine structure transition, there is an additional pair of HFS lines with ∆F = 0. The Einstein A-coefficients for these lines are smaller than those of the lines listed in Table 1 with ∆F = ∆J = 1 by factors between ≈ 5 and 30 1 . While these lines were covered in our band pass, none were detected; for root mean square (rms) noise levels, see Appendix A. Detected thus far in emission toward hot cores, the fine-structure lines of o-CH 2 and their corresponding HFS lines tabulated in Table 1 are naively expected to be weakly populated given the physical conditions that prevail in these regions.

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The method is based on the integral formulation of rigorous Faddeevtype three-body scattering theory for transition operators as proposed by Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas [11], but extended for the Hilbert space H g ⊕ H x whose sectors correspond to the core being in its ground (g) or excited (x) state. These sectors are coupled by the nucleon-core twobody potentials v ji α where the superscripts j and i, being either g or x, label the internal states of the core, and the subscript α, being A, p, or n, labels the spectator particle in the odd-man-out notation.

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data. We multiply KD single-particle β 2 = 0 differential cross sections by the respective SF of the model with the core excitation and compare with the KD(β 2 = 0.5) results fully including the core excitation. The difference between these two results, or the deviation of the ratio  The experimental data at E d = 21 MeV are from Ref.

We start with the excited state 1 2 + analysis in Fig. 4 where we expect some similarities with the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) case [12][13][14]. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10.

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane. The resulting ν s value amounts to (836 ± 18) cm −1 . It is in good agreement with the values, (823 ± 14) cm −1 , 825 cm −1 , and (850 ± 25) cm −1 observed in acetone [7], [C 4 mim][Tf 2 N] [8], and in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] [9], respectively. This vibration corresponds to a Raman active vibration of the uranyl unit and can be correlated to the yl-U -O bond length. Using the empiric relation of Bartlett and Cooney [47]:\nR U−O /(Å) = 106.5 × ν −2/3 s + 0.575(1)\nwe calculated the U -O bond length to be equal to (1.77 ± 0.01) Å (using ν s = (836 ± 18) cm −1 ) for our uranyl sample. This value is in a good agreement with all experimental data listed in Table I, and can therefore serve as reference data to assess the accuracy of the ab initio calculations we will now discuss.",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

With increasing of polarity the ν U−Cl stretching frequencies insignificantly increase (4 and 7 cm −1 ) for the ground and excited states, respectively, while the uranyl ν b , ν s and ν a decrease by 5 up to 25 cm −1 in both states. This shift of the ground-state frequencies should be observable in the computed luminescence spectra, namely in the spacing between the vi- brationally resolved peaks, while the minor change of the excited state frequencies should only affect the vibronic intensities. The substitution of chlorides by bromides in the uranyl equatorial plane lead to the following changes in the vibrational spectra. Compared to uranyl tetrachloride, the ν b value decreased by less than 10 cm −1 in both ground and excited states. The ν s increased by 13 and 62 cm −1 in the ground and excited states, respectively. Similarly, the ν a increased by 14 cm −1 for the ground and 76 cm −1 for the first excited state. The U -Br stretching mode is 83 cm −1 lower in both ground and excited states than the U -Cl symmetric stretching vibration. This is in line with the ground-state experimental trends measured for\nCs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 with [C 7 H 16 NO 2 ][UO 2\nBr 4 ] (91, 2, 6 and 9 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively). These changes indicate that the bromide ligand has a smaller effect on the electronic structure of uranium than chloride, since the U-Br bond strength is essentially ionic and has less impact on the U-O bonding. Consistently, the uranium -oxygen symmetrical stretching frequency is higher than in the chloride complex and close to the bare uranyl value. For [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2we estimate a shift of frequencies between the ground and excited state equal to 6, 2, 31 and 53 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively.",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

A. Wheeler [1] proposed the existence of several kinds of exotic systems composed of three particles with equal masses and bound through Coulomb interaction. The positronium negative ion (Ps − ), a bound state of a positron and two electrons, is the only system that has been observed thus far [2]. Since the prediction by Wheeler, many theoretical studies have been performed to explore the nature of Ps − . For example, the ground-state energy and the annihilation rate have been calculated [3]- [10] and the photodetachment process has been studied [11]- [13]. However, measurements of the decay rate have been the only experiments performed for many years [14]- [16] because of extremely low Ps − intensities.\n\nIn 2006, a new method of generating Ps − was developed [17]. Some of the slow positrons injected into a clean tungsten sample are emitted as Ps − . Although the formation efficiency observed was less than 0.01%, a dramatic enhancement of the efficiency up to 1.25% has been achieved by coating Cs atoms onto the tungsten surface [18,19]. Furthermore, coating with Na has been found to be as effective for Ps − production and the effect appears to remain for longer [20]. This technique has enabled us to perform the first observation of the photodetachment of Ps − [21]. This paper will give a brief review of the experimental studies performed so far.\n\nby the detector were blue shifted and hence separated from the γ-rays from any other two photon annihilation processes. The Ps − formation efficiency, the fraction of positrons yielding Ps − , was 0.028%. Mills also investigated the decay rate of the Ps − . The bias for the gird in front of the target and the distance between the target and the foil were changed and the Ps − formation efficiencies measured were fitted to obtain the decay rate. The value determined was 2.09 (9) ns −1 , which is consistent with the theoretical value calculated by Ho [5].",

The computed expectation values as well as positron and positronium affinities are in good agreement with their restricted Hartree-Fock counterparts.Binding of a positron to neutral atomic species is also investigated using an iterative method.PACS numbers: 36.10Dr, 71.60.+zI. INTRODUCTIONDespite extensive studies [1-11] the problem of a positron forming a transient bound state with a neutral atomhas not yet been decisively settled. It is known that a negatively charged ion always binds a positron; in fact it turns out that there is an infinite number of bound states. The classical Coulomb interaction between an anion and a positron is sufficient to bind a positron while in case of neutral atoms the polarization of electron charge distribution is found to be vital for binding[12]. Schrader et al. [13,14] have calculated the positronium affinities for halogen atoms using a diffusion quantum Monte Carlo technique in which the core region is represented by a model potential. Accurate calculations on the positronium hydride, positronium helium and positronium lithium systems using the all particle diffusion Monte Carlo method have been recently reported by Yoshida et al. [8,9]. Very recently, Bressanini [15] et al. have investigated the positron-anion bound states for the anionic species Li − , B − , C − , O − and F − using variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo techniques. They found that except B − all these systems are stable against dissociation into the corresponding neutral atom and positronium. Such methods are computationally very demanding thereby restricting their applicability to systems with fewer particles. The independent particle approximation methods such as the Hartree-Fock or density functional theories enable one to compute with ease the anionic-positron interactions for all the anions in the periodic table. Calculations within the restricted HF theory have been reported by Cade and Farazdel [16,17] and Patrick and Cade [12] for the systems",

The CI method has recently been applied to the study of positronic atoms (electronically stable states consisting of a positron bound to an atom) [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20] and also to positron-atom scattering states [21,22,23]. The attractive electronpositron interaction leads to the formation of a Ps cluster (i.e. something akin to a positronium atom) in the outer valence region of the atom [12,19,24,25].\n\nThe accurate representation of a Ps cluster using only single particle orbitals centered on the nucleus requires the inclusion of orbitals with much higher angular momenta than a roughly equivalent electron-only calculation [11,12,26,27]. In the most extreme case so far considered, namely e + Li, a calculation with J = 30 was required before the energy had decreased enough to establish binding. Given that helium is described as slowly convergent [1], one struggles to find an adjective that could characterize the convergence properties of positronic systems! The two most important expectation values for positronic systems are the energy, and the rate for electron-positron annihilation. The annihilation rate, which is proportional to the expectation of the electronpositron δ-function, has the inconvenient property that it is even more slowly convergent than the energy with respect to orbital angular momentum. One has successive increments decreasing at high J according to [7,15,28]:\n∆Γ J = Γ J − Γ J−1 ≈ A Γ (J + 1 2 ) 2 ,(2)\nTo put this in perspective, it would take a calculation with J ≈ 250 to recover 99% of the PsH annihilation rate [10]. In addition to the slow convergence with J, the δ-function operator also exhibits very slow convergence with respect to the radial basis [10].",

The thermalized positron will eventually annihilate with an electron of the medium. It can annihilate as a free particle with an electron of the medium into two -photons each carrying the mass-energy (~511 keV) of the annihilating particles. However, due to energy advantage, a significant fraction of thethermalized positrons forms a bound state, positronium (Ps), a hydrogen-like atom consisting of the positron and an electron of the medium prior to annihilation. Due to the relatively large size of the Ps atoms, they only form within and annihilate from the pores in molecular media, thus making them unique and efficient probes of such 'holes' in the matrix. Depending on the spin configurations of the two particles, a Ps atom form as a para-positronium (p-Ps: antiparallel positron and electron spins; total spin 0) or an ortho-Positronium (o-Ps: parallel positron and electron spins; total spin 1). The total spins of the two Ps-states dictate that an o-Ps has an abundance of three times that of p-Ps. In vacuum, a p-Ps annihilates into twophotons with a lifetime of 125 ps while an o-Ps annihilates into three -photons with a lifetime of 142 ns which is three orders of magnitude larger. During the relatively long lifetime of the more abundant o-Ps, it undergoes numerous collisions with the surrounding walls of the pores.

The resulting Ps atom subsequently annihilates by emitting two or three gamma-ray quanta.\n\nIn this review, attention is restricted to positron energies below the Ps-formation threshold, 0 < ε < E th , where the Ps channel is closed. Here annihilation occurs as a result of the overlap of the positron and electron densities during the collision.

(1) for some species (e.g., argon and nitrogen), the rate for dichlorofluoromethane CCl 2 F 2 (\"Freon-12\") was much larger. Deutsch insightfully ascribed this effect to some type of resonant positron-molecule attachment process. A decade later, Paul and Saint-Pierre (1963) measured annihilation rates in gases of alkane molecules C n H 2n+2 , from methane to butane, n = 1-4.

The e + Na system is formulated as a three-body system: a frozen core, a positron and an electron. In this way, the system resembles the hydrogen-positron system, but there are some qualitative differences. First, the interaction between the Na + core and the active electron is Coulombic only at very long range. At shorter distances the nuclear charge is only partially screened, which makes it necessary to employ some sort of model potential for the e − Na + interaction. More generally this interaction should also include electron exchange, but this has not been explicitly included in our study. The e + Na interaction is, like the e + H interaction, at long distances dominated by the polarizability of the atom, giving a potential ∝ r −4 . The polarizability of Na (162 atomic units) is however larger than that of H (4.5 atomic units), which allows the formation of a truly bound state of the e + Na system [1]. Furthermore, the hydrogen atom has energy levels degenerate with respect to orbital angular momentum (neglecting fine structure) whereas the alkali atoms do not. Another characteristic of a positron-Na system is that the ionization energy of Na (0.19 a.u.) is smaller than the binding energy of Ps (0.25 a.u.), allowing for positronium formation even at zero impact energy.\n\nS-, P-, and D-wave resonances are calculated for energies extending up to the positronium (Ps) n = 2 formation thresholds for natural parity. Resonance states for P e and D o are calculated for unnatural parity for energies extending up to the Ps, n = 3 formation threshold; which have not been previously reported. Below both positron-ium thresholds we have for each symmetry identified dipole series of resonances, with binding energies scaling in good agreement with expectations from an analytical calculation [2].

The ratio of the peak counts to total counts in a curve of detected gamma radiation represents low-momentum positrons and corresponds to positron annihilation with the valence electrons. This is called the S-parameter and is sensitive to open volume defects. In bulk solids, its increase indicates the presence of vacancy defects. Moreover, it is important to note that because of the finite momentum of the electron-positron pair, the annihilation energy of 511 keV gets Doppler-shifted by an amount ∆E. Since numerous annihilation events are measured to give the complete Doppler spectrum, the energy line is broadened due to the individual Doppler shifts along the annihilation direction. Coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) spectroscopy gives information on the electron momentum distribution in the sample and ultimately, gives insight on the elemental composition of the annihilation cavity walls.

The interaction between a positron and an electron leads either to immediate annihilation, their mass being entirely converted into energy in the form of gamma-rays (γ-rays), or can combine temporarily into an exotic atomic form called positronium (Ps) (Fig. 3A). The Ps is similar to an hydrogen atom in which the proton is substituted by the positron, but in contrast to 1 H it annihilates rapidly into γ-rays. [29] For polymers, the regions of low electron density, where Ps can be formed, correspond to free volume cavities with a radius of 0.2-0.6 nm. Two spin states are possible, namely para-positronium (p-Ps) and orthopositronium (o-Ps), with the latter having a longer lifetime of about 142 ns in vacuum.

Positrons slow to thermal energies through inelastic collisions and positron-phonon interactions, and once thermalized, the positron will either annihilate as a free particle, a trapped particle or in a bound state with an electron called positronium. The triplet ground state of positronium, ortho-positronium (o-Ps), annihilates by a mechanism known as pick-off whereby the o-Ps localizes in pockets of free volume and eventually annihilates with an electron from the surrounding matter. The time to annihilation, or o-Ps lifetime, is measured by birth and death gamma rays. 9 The lifetime of o-Ps has been directly correlated with the pore size (the lifetime being shortened if the pick-off electron is nearby) while the number of annihilations has been directly correlated with the relative number of pores. 16 The application of PALS to crystalline MOF-5 provided both information complimentary to standard gas sorption analysis, but moreover offers unique insights into internal pore structure, including defects. 17 PALS has also been used to rationalise the absence of porosity in the theoretically porous Zn-HKUST-1 MOF. In this case, the surface of the activated material was found to be unstable; this collapsed crystal surface formed a barrier which prevented gas molecules from accessing the interior. 18 Correlations between gas permeability and the free volume, measured by PALS, in mixed matrix membranes have also been reported. 12,19 Motivated by the ability to probe the internal structures of the newly reported melt-quenched MOF-glasses, 5 here we report the application of PALS to a glass formed by melt-quenching of ZIF-4, a three-dimensional metal-organic framework of composition Zn(C 3 H 3 N 2 ) 2 . 20 Prior to melting at 573 1C, recrystallization to a known dense framework of identical chemical composition, ZIF-zni, is observed. 5 The porosities of ZIF-4, ZIF-zni and the resultant melt quenched glass (a g ZIF-4), shown in Fig.",

Since the Coulomb interaction is symmetric in terms of particle charge, the binding energy of a negative trion with electron-hole mass ratio σ is equal to the binding energy of a positive trion with electron-hole mass ratio 1/σ. In fact, it is often more convenient to show the binding energy of a trion in terms of the rescaled mass ratio x = σ/(1 + σ) ∈ [0, 1] rather than σ ∈ [0, ∞).

The Distributed Positron Model\n\nAn alternative model correlation-polarization potential we have used to describe the V pcp in Eq. (10) is the distributed positron model (DPM) potential, V DP M pcp [17,18]. The form adopted here for the correlation-polarization V DP M pcp is based on a modification of the adiabatic polarization approximation, which provides a variational estimate of the polarization potential. In the adiabatic polarization approximation, in fact, the positron is treated as an additional \"nucleus\" (a point charge of +1) fixed at location r p with respect to the center of mass of the atomic or molecular target. The target orbitals are allowed to relax in the presence of this fixed additional charge and the decrease in energy due to the distortion is recorded. The difference between the final and initial values of the energy defines the adiabatic polarization potential at one point in space. In order to describe carefully the spatial dependence of this interaction, the calculations need to be performed on a rather large number of three dimensional grid points.\n\nHowever, due to nonadiabatic and short-range correlation effects, e.g., virtual Ps formation, the adiabatic approximation mayoverestimate the strength of the polarization potential for smaller values of r p , where the positron has penetrated the target electronic cloud. The present model corrects for this by treating the positron as a \"smeared out\" charge distribution rather than as a point charge. If the scattering particle really were an additional point charge, then the dominant short-range correlation effect would be virtual hydrogen atom formation into ground and excited states, and the δ-function distribution of positive charge at the center of mass would be correct.\n\nBut, for a Ps atom, the positive charge is not localized at the center of mass, and to mimic this effect in computing the polarization potential we represent the positron as a spherically symmetric distribution of charge. This leads to a polarization potential that more closely reflects the correct physics and that smoothly reduces to the expected result for larger values of r p without any need to select a crossover distance as done in the previous treatment.",

Lattice defects containing hydrogen and helium in Pd have been studied by positron model calculations using Density Functional Theory [DFT] in its local density approximation [LDA] [1] implementation. A correlation between the positron lifetime, positron ground stage energy and number atoms of H and He has been established. It was found that the value of positron lifetime for perfect Pd lattice is 106 ps and for mono vacancy is 184 ps which corresponds to the experimental values.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPositron quantum mechanical calculations were carried out for investigation of defects in palladium containing hydrogen and helium atoms. Recently the convergence of electronic structure calculations for super cell size has been studied for vacancy, vacancy clusters and vacancy clusters contacting hydrogen and helium atoms [2,3]. The electron wave function in palladium has been obtained in LDA to the DFT. The determination of electron and positron states in condensed matter has been done on the basis of a generalization of DFT known as two component DTF (TCDFT). The ground state electron and positron densities are calculated solving a set of one particle Kohn-Sham equation for electrons and positrons.

Positronium (Ps) is a bound state of positron and electron. The Ps formation process in insulators is well-explained by the spur reaction model proposed by Mogensen in the case of positrons with energies of more than 100eV [1]. The model describes the Ps formation process as a combination of a thermalized positron and one of the excess electrons formed by the positron irradiation at the terminal spur of the positron track within about 1ps. A quarter of the Ps forms as para-Ps (p-Ps, singlet Ps), and three quarters form as ortho-Ps (o-Ps, triplet Ps).\n\nBasically, in a vacuum, p-Ps annihilates with a lifetime of 125ps through the intrinsic annihilation of two annihilation γ-rays being emitted while o-Ps annihilate with an intrinsic annihilation lifetime of 142ns through three γ-rays being emitted. In condensed matter a positron in Ps can annihilate with one of the electrons from the surrounding molecules, which is known as \"pick-off\" annihilation. This mainly occurs with o-Ps because of its long intrinsic annihilation lifetime. Pick-off annihilation mainly provides two annihilation γ-rays. A positron that escapes the Ps formation, i.e. a free positron, can also annihilate with one of the electrons from the surrounding molecules. The lifetime of the free positrons is about 400ps, with free positron annihilation also mainly providing two annihilation γ-rays.\n\nBecause of Ps negative work functions in many materials, Ps is repelled by surrounding substance, * To whom any correspondence should be addressed.  The size of the bubble is controlled by the zero point  energy of Ps in the bubble and the energy of the bubble by the surface tension and the pressure. Therefore the bubble size should be larger with increasing temperature, for the less surface tension at higher temperatures. For the larger bubble size, the pick-off annihilation probability of Ps in the bubble is smaller because of the less overlapping of the positron in Ps and electrons on the wall of the bubble.",

We take the proton mass, deuteron mass, and triton mass to be m p + = 1836.152673440001 a.u., m d + = 3670.482967853717 a.u., and m t + = 5496.921535729647 a.u., respectively [40]. The energy required to separate an electron from a hydrogen anion slightly increases with isotope mass, as expected from Fig. 2, and the corresponding energy approaches the σ = 0 limit of a negatively charged trion. The same trend is observed for Ps − and Mu − (a bound state of an antimuon and two electrons), while the calculated values are in good agreement with the available experimental data.\n\nSimilarly, DMC predicts a slight increase in binding energy with mass ratio for the three molecular cations of hydrogen isotopes, as seen in Table IV. The corresponding values approach the σ = 0 limit for a positively charged trion, so that the heavier isotope T + 2 has a 3% larger binding energy than the lighter isotope H + 2 . For comparison, we also show the total energy and binding energy of the hydrogen ions calculated using Eq. (17) in Table IV. There is excellent agreement between the DMC results and Eq. (17). Consequently, knowing the electron-hole mass ratio, Eq. (17) can be used to predict the total energy and binding energy of either a trion in an isotropic semiconductor or a Coulomb complex in free space.",

For instance, it can be estimated [4] that, in the presence of a radiative field (which always exists in reality), the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom can fall down to the top of the negative-energy continuum in less than one nanosecond, and it can even trigger a radiation catastrophe via continuous radiative transitions. To resolve this apparent untruth, Dirac [13] proposed in 1930 that all states of negative energy be filled, such that transitions of electrons to negative-energy states are forbidden by virtue of the Pauli exclusion principle. Since a hole left by exciting an electron from the filled negative-energy sea has a positive energy and the same mass but opposite charge as the leaving electron, it was interpreted by Dirac in 1931 [14] as an anti-electron (positive electron/positron). Although highly controversial, this bold prediction was confirmed by experiment just one year later [15]. Notwithstanding such a big triumph, Dirac's hole theory has a number of defects [16]:\n\n(1) It is asymmetric with respect to electrons and positrons.\n\n(2) It characterizes a positron as a virtual hole rather than a real particle.\n\n(3) It involves an infinite negative electric charge filling the whole space even if only one electron is under consideration.\n\n(4) It has to assume that the negative-energy electrons do not generate any potential acting on the positive-energy electrons. Otherwise, no nuclear charge could generate an enough attraction to compensate the infinitely repulsive potential.\n\n(5) It does not, in a strict sense, explain the stability of a positive-energy electron: being infinitely large, the sea can always accept infinitely many electrons. In other words, the Pauli exclusion principle does not really hold for a system of an infinite number of fermions.\n\n(6) It does not apply to spin-0 particles (described by the Klein-Gordon equation (4)) which do not satisfy an exclusion principle.",

The total atomic energies and various one electron properties of work formalism are practically equivalent to those of HF theory [26]. Unlike other local exchange-only density functionals, the work formalism of HS selectively gives convergent orbitals and eigenvalues for negative ions that are comparable to the HF accuracy [30]. In the present communication, we address the problem of positron binding to anions and atoms within the exchange-only work formalism. The purpose of the present work is two-fold: 1) To compute the positron affinities and binding energies using local orbital-independent density functional theory. 2) To test the work formalism of the Harbola-Sahni for the description of many electron-positron system. The computed positron affinities, binding energies and < r n > − moments (n = −1 through 2) within the work formalism are compared against their restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) counterparts.

Particularly, understanding positron's interaction with molecules and the concomitant positron-electron annihilation process are of great interest. Beyond the academic curiosity, the annihilation process is the basis of the Positron Emission Tomography as a powerful medicinal imaging technique. [6] Accordingly, a large body of experimental, [7][8][9][10] and theoretical and computational,  studies have been conducted recently on polyatomic and diatomic, [32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] positronic species in order to trace the sticking site of the positron. These studies reveal that in general the positronic density is very diffuse and is not centered between bonds but behind the most electronegative atom of the molecule (the cases with two or more atoms with equal electronegativity are more complicated). [20] It is usually perceived that the positron does not participate directly in forming the chemical bonds. Only through the reorganization of electronic structure, which seems to be marginal in general, positron may indirectly affect the bonds between atoms. However, in some very simple positronic species like positronium hydride, [40][41][42][43] positronic water, [44,45] and di-positronium, [46][47][48] there are evidence that the positron is actively participating in bonding interactions. By the way, it is hard to contemplate these species as composed of discernable atoms in molecules, so their classification as molecules is ambivalent and the chemical nature of bonding in these species yet seems to be obscure. 3 With such background in mind, the recently published paper by Charry, Varella and Reyes (hereafter denoted as CVR) claiming the first unambiguous positronic bond is quite striking. [49] Armed with their newly developed ab initio code, LOWDIN, [50,51] which is capable of dealing with multi-component quantum systems, the authors solved Schrödinger's equation for 2 2 , eH +−",

The one electron expectation values are in good agreement with their HF counterparts. The computed < 1/r > values are slightly larger than the HF values, implying the slight increase in the positron density towards the nucleus which therefore, should be compensated by small reduction in the long-range of the positron density leading to smaller < r > and < r 2 >. This is indeed the case as can be seen from the Table IV. We have also investigated the binding of positron to neutral atoms in the spirit of Patrick and Cade, by starting with the anion-positron bound state and reducing the ionicity of the system to obtain desired neutral system. It was found that the neutral-atom positron bound state does not exist in the exchange-only work formalism. This, however, is not surprising as the present treatment lacks the electron-positron and electron-electron correlation effects which are crucial to permit such a binding [21]. Further, it has been rigorously shown by Pathak [35] that the deviation from the spherical symmetry is a necessary condition in order that the positron binding to neutral atom would occur.\n\nThe present treatment can be extended to include the correlations effects, namely the electron-electron Coulomb correlations, correlation contribution to the kinetic energy and the electron-positron correlation. The first one can be incorporated by modeling the correlation second-order density matrix as suggested by Levy and Perdew [27] while the second one can be derived in terms of density matrices via virial theorem [25]. The electron-positron correlation potential [36] can be added in an ad hoc manner to the effective potential.\n\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the present work, the positron binding to negative ions is investigated within the exchange-only work formalism.\n\nThe work formalism of Harbola-Sahni seems to provide the Hartree-Fock level description of the electron-positron system as can be seen from the agreement between the present values of positron and positronium affinities and their restricted Hartree-Fock counterpart.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW\n\nThe subject of this review is the interaction of lowenergy positrons with molecules. Positrons, the antiparticles of electrons, are important in many areas of science and technology. Much of their utility relies on the fact that, when an electron and positron interact, they can annihilate, producing a characteristic burst of gammarays. The lowest order process results in two back-toback photons, each with the energy of the rest mass of the electron (or positron), 511 keV.\n\nThe annihilation of low-energy (e.g., ≤ 50 eV) positrons on atoms and molecules plays a particularly important role in many fields. In medicine, positron emission tomography (PET) exploits two-gamma annihilation to study human metabolic processes (Wahl, 2002). In materials science, there are numerous positron-based techniques to study the properties of matter (Coleman, 2000;Dupasquier and Mills, 1995;Puska and Nieminen, 1994;Schultz and Lynn, 1988), including the Fermi surfaces in metals (Major et al., 2004), microscopic pores in solids (Gidley et al., 2000(Gidley et al., , 2006, the free volume in polymers (Dlubek et al., 1998), and the composition and structure of surfaces (David et al., 2001). In astronomy, 511 keV annihilation radiation, the strongest gamma ray line of extraterrestrial origin, has proven useful in elucidating astrophysical processes (Churazov et al., 2005;Guessoum et al., 2010;Ramaty et al., 1992). A current research goal is the creation of a Bose condensate of positronium (Ps) atoms (i.e., the electron-positron analog of the hydrogen atom) that offers promise for the development of an annihilation gamma-ray laser (Cassidy and Mills, 2007;Mills, 2002Mills, , 2007Mills et al., 2004).",

The positron is a particle with a positive charge and the same mass as an electron, and is generated from a positron source, normally a radioactive isotope 22 Na. The schematic diagram for PALS technique and its mechanism is illustrated in Figure 11. Figure (a) shows the general outline of the PALS setup. When a positron e + emits from the radioactive source, an accompany ν ray with the energy of 1274 keV is given off simultaneously and detected by one detector, marking the birth of a positron. Then the positron will quickly slow down (at picosecond scale) and form a positronium (Ps). After diffusing and residing in a pore for a few nanoseconds, Ps will annihilate with the electron layer at the internal wall due to the overlap of Ps wave function with the above electron layer as shown in Figure (b). The annihilation of Ps will give off another ν ray with the energy of 511 keV and detected by a second detector, marking the end of a positron. The time difference between these events is basically the lifetime of Ps, which is converted to the electronic signal via a timeamplitude-convertor (TAC) and recorded in a computer. The relationship between the lifetime of Ps and pore radius (r) is well described by the Tao-Eldrup equation as follows:\n   0.5ns 1 R R  R  sin 2R R  R       1\nwhere τ is lifetime to Ps, R is the radius of a pore, and ΔR is an empirical value, 1.66Å, representing the thickness of electron layer on the internal wall of the pore [130].",

However, being localized in free volume holes in polymers, o-Ps undergoes 2γ pickup annihilation and its lifetime is shortened down to a few nanoseconds depending on the free volume hole size. Generally, positrons may annihilate via p-Ps, free positron and o-Ps in polymers. These three annihilation branches of positrons can be respectively characterized by their lifetimes τ 1 (∼125 ps), τ 2 (∼300 ps), τ 3 (1∼10 ns) and the corresponding relative intensities. Being the longest lived component, the o-Ps lifetime (τ o−Ps ) is of particular importance for the studies of polymer free volumes because it's related to the average free volume hole size and it is determined by the overlapping of positronium wave function",

As a result, an excess negative charge appears in the center of the blob which retains thermalized e + inside the blob. Debye screening of the e + charge by other charged blob species also leads to e + confinement inside the blob. In other molecular substances where electron mobility is greater than the mobility of positive ions, there is an opposite effect: e + may escape during thermalization outside the blob [14]. 6 7) The temperature increase of the positronium formation probability P qf-Ps is related to a decrease in the energy needed for the production of one ion-electron pair (i.e. a decrease in the ionization potential of water).

Quasi-free electrons are produced when the energetic particle enters the sample and loses its energy in favour of ionization of surrounding particles. These electrons can be localized for sufficient time in sites called traps and are accessible for other processes. Because the bond energy in the trap is relatively small (about 1 eV), the electrons can influence chemical reactions as quasi-free radicals. On the other hand, the bond energy is higher than the mean thermal energy at ambient temperature (or lower); therefore, the electrons are stabilized in traps and can be accumulated during the time of radiolytic irradiation. In particular, the trapping process plays an important role during the radiolytic processes induced by the energetic positron (β + radiation) penetrating the solid sample. Besides the basic knowledge of the radiolytical processes, the knowledge of the trapping mechanism allows proper interpretation of many results of experiments supported by positron-based techniques. Especially, the processes related to trapped electrons are the subject of investigations in the PALS technique (Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy) [?]. The most useful medium for investigating the trapping processes here are simple polymers and alkanes due to their weakly polarized bonds. Here, there are no fractionally charged sites, which could catch the electrons and decrease the process of accumulation thereof in shallower traps. The subject of investigations of traps in alkanes in positron annihilation studies are traps that can collect electrons for a long enough time to facilitate catching them by positrons (the typical positron lifetime in solids are hundreds of picoseconds or nanoseconds in the case of the bound state of the positron called positronium). The electrons can settle in pre-existing or dynamically made traps somewhere in the structure. The lifetime of the electrons in these traps is sufficiently long for accumulation thereof increasingly after each next passage of the positron through the sample. In the meantime, some other processes involving positrons and electrons take place. Namely, when a positron reaches the thermal energy, it is possible for it to capture one of electrons from the surroundings and either annihilate it (free positron annihilation) or create the bound state called positronium (Ps). An electron that can react with the positron can be a trapped electron. PALS spectroscopy is",

Apart from the attraction between the nucleus and electrons, there remain two principal contributions to the energy in an atomic system: (1) inter-electronic repulsion, which is responsible for the energy separation between the terms arising from a given configuration, and (2) spin-orbit interaction, which gives rise to the energy intervals between the components within a given term. In the L-S coupling scheme, it is assumed that electronic repulsion is much greater than spin-orbit interaction. In the terminology of quantum mechanics, the spin-orbit interaction in this scheme is treated as a perturbation.\n\nThe L-S coupling scheme involves the orbital angular momentum quantum number L and the spin angular momentum quantum number S. They define an electronic term conventionally designated by a term symbol written in the form 2S+1 L J . The addition of L and S gives the total angular momentum quantum number J, which has the allowed values given by the sequence: L + S, L + S -1, … , |L -S|.

This classification of orbitals into atomic shells is further sub-divided because an electron can occupy an atomic shell by orbiting around in various forms. These different forms are captured by the notion of subshell, and each subshell is represented by the angular momentum quantum number, l. In chemistry, one writes down the shell and subshell that an electron occupies, in terms of the value of the principle quantum number (n) and the letters s,p,d,f that correspond to the values of the angular momentum quantum number (l). So, for example 1 s represents a subshell of the s-form that occupies the lowest atomic shell, 2p represents the p subshell in the second atomic shell etc.\n\nMoreover, from the quantum calculation of the probability density of finding an electron at a particular subshell, it turns out that not all atomic shells allow all forms of subshells (p. 33, Atkins and Jones 2010). This is because for example, the wave function of a p-electron vanishes at its nucleus. That is why, in shell-1 an electron will be found to occupy only an s-subshell, and not a p-or f-subshell.

How the angular momenta of the unpaired electron play their role in the reaction is unclear. As the electron angular momentum couplings of the F atom are fully considered, the previous single partial wave L will split into 4-fold partial waves, with total angular momentum quantum numbers L ± 1/2 and L ± 3/2, as the result of the coupling of s and l to the nuclear orbital angular momentum L. The inclusion of the interference between these four spin-orbit split resonance pathways should then be considered, which is challenging both theoretically and experimentally.\n\nAll previous product quantum state-resolved theoretical investigations invoke electronic adiabatic approximation, which neglects the spin-orbit effects. If the role of the electronic angular momenta could be revealed is not altogether clear, because the associated energy splitting is so small. Usually the DCSs are contributed by many partial waves that may smear out the fine structures caused by the electronic angular momenta. Notably, the reactive resonance in the F + HD reaction is very special, which is well separated and of long lifetime, exhibiting as a sharp peak in the excitation function of a single partial wave. This reaction provides the chance to magnify the sighting of the role of electronic angular momenta. With high-resolution crossed molecular beam experiments, the scattering patterns of quantum state-resolved products over the full angular range can be captured. In the work by Chen et al., a more sensitive technique called near-threshold ionization was developed and employed in the crossed molecular beams velocity map ion imaging measurement. 1 The angular structures observed in the work by Chen et al. turn out to be beneficial in sighting the oscillations of the quantum interferences between the spin-orbit split partial wave reactive resonances.

If Heisenberg's matrix mechanics or the Schrödinger equation would have been known and accepted when the SGE was performed, the outcome of the SGE could have been calculated with these theories and nobody might have been surprised by the results of the SGE! Nevertheless the mechanism of beam splitting remains an unsolved example of the quantum measurement problem. Solving the Schrödinger equation for a silver atom in its ground state in a magnetic field one finds directional quantization in perfect agreement with the SGE results. One obtains as solutions (measurable observables) only welldefined angular momentum eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the angular momentum quantum number l representing an angular momentum component of l · , the so called magnetic quantum number m with an angular momentum component of m· , and the electron spin quantum number component s with an angular momentum of s · . According to the Schrödinger equation, the angular momentum vector can never be determined in quantum physics in direction and length simultaneously. One can only measure the total length of the angular momentum vector together with angular momentum eigenvalues representing projections (i.e. l, m, and s) of the angular momentum vector along the direction of external forces. The components in x-and y-directions cannot be determined accurately at the same time.\n\nThe new quantum theory does not allow any other projections of the angular momenta for the atoms in a magnetic field, i.e. at the point of measurement after the passage of the atoms through the SG apparatus. Thus, the expectation of continuous distributions is a purely classical view. Angular momentum projections smaller than these eigenvalues are forbidden. In quantum physics one can only visualize projections of the angular momentum quantized in in a direction given by the measurement. This is exactly what Stern and Gerlach observed. The directional quantization is a consequence of the finite size of . Directional quantization must always be present and visible in any measurement data of any quantum system. All structure and dynamics have the signature of angular momentum quantization, and directional quantization is always present in any measurement of a quantum process.",

The total spin angular momentum, S, of an atom or molecule is expressed by the equation S = √[s(s + 1)]ħ. s gives rise to the quantum number m s , and only two values are allowed. When m s = ½, the e − is described as spin up (↑); when m s = −½, the e − is described as spin down (↓). The Pauli exclusion principle states that the total wave function for a system must be antisymmetric to the exchange of any pair of electrons. Differently stated, no two electrons of a given atom or molecule can have identical quantum numbers, and for two electrons to occupy an orbital, each electron must have opposite spins, that is, one orbital e − must have an m s = ½ (↑), the other orbital e − must have an m s = −½ (↓). Consequently, the total spin quantum number, S, for a filled orbital electron-couple is ½ + −½ = 0 (↑↓).\n\nBosons obey Bose-Einstein statistics, and have wave functions that are symmetric to exchange of a pair of particles; that is, Ψ (a, b) = Ψ (b, a).

Accordingly, the total orbital angular momentum can take the values of L = 0, 1, and 2 because the allowed values of the total angular momentum for the system of two angular momenta of j 1 and j 2 are j = j 1 + j 2 , j 1 + j 2 -1, . . . , |j 1 − j 2 | according to quantum mechanics [113]. The orbitals for L = 0, 1, 2, 3 are referred to as S, P, D, F, respectively [114]. For the configuration of the left side of Figure 9, L = 2 is impossible due to the Pauli's exclusion principle because two spins are parallel in spite of the fact that the orbital angular momenta are also in parallel [115]. It is known that L = 0 is also impossible for this case due to Pauli's exclusion principle [112]. Accordingly, the ground state of an O atom (O radical) is for L = 1 and designated by 3 P where the total spin angular momentum s is coded in the form of 2s + 1 in the left superscript.",

Here, we treat the effect of these interac-tions on the electronic configuration in the different angular momentum coupling schemes, i.e., j j-, LS-, and intermediate coupling. This will be illustrated for the example of the f 2 configuration. This two-particle state is rather straightforward as it does not require explicit use of coefficients of fractional parentage or creation and annihilation operators. It is also shown how to obtain the expectation values of the moments in each of the different coupling schemes. For further reading on these topics we refer e.g. to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Multiplet Calculations [77].\n\n\nAtomic Interactions\n\nFor n electrons moving about a point nucleus of charge, the Hamiltonian can be written in the central field approximation as\nH = H el + H so ,(1)\nwhere H el and H so are the terms for the electrostatic and spin-orbit interaction, respectively. This atomic Hamiltonian can be embedded in a solid state, e.g., using an Anderson impurity model [78]. Crystal field interactions are usually less prominent in the actinides, leading only to a small perturbation, therefore we assume a spherical potential. In any case, all interactions can be separated in angular and radial parts. The angular parts depend on the angular quantum numbers of the basis states of the electronic configuration and are independent of the radial wave functions, which in the calculations are taken as empirical scaled parameters (see Sec. 8.3).\n\nThe basis wave functions are assumed to be an antisymmetrized product of oneelectron functions. In spherical symmetry, these basis states are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum J and its component M J . The states are characterized by quantum numbers αLS, where α is a suitable quantity for distinguishing between terms having the same values of the orbital and spin angular momenta, L and S.\n\n\nElectrostatic Interactions",

CONCLUSIONS\n\nFull-dimensional dynamics of CO interacting with H 2 is a challenging computational problem for quantum mechanical scattering formulations. The closely spaced rotational levels for CO lead to substantial internal angular momentum coupling between the molecules.\n\nWhen orbital angular momentum is properly taken into account within the numerically exact CC formulation, the additional angular momentum coupling creates a bottleneck for many rovibrationally excited initial states, which makes it impossible to bring the calculations to completion on a practical timescale. In such cases, it is necessary to use approximate methods to obtain the desired data. The CS approximation offers a good compromise between accuracy and computational effort. In this approximation, the exact orbital angular momentum quantum number is replaced by an effective value, and the off-diagonal Coriolis coupling between states with different projection quantum numbers is neglected. Averaging the PES over the twist angle to obtain the 5D-CS approximation further improves the computational efficiency without introducing a significant additional loss of accuracy beyond the CS approximation itself.\n\nUsing the 5D-CS approximation, we constructed two separate databases for state-to-state cross sections and rate coefficients for CO+H 2 collisions.

These couplings can be quite complicated for molecules with unpaired electrons and non-zero nuclear spins. Different limiting cases of the coupling hierarchy are described by the so-called \"Hund's cases\". For example, many molecules can be described as Hund's case (a), where spin-orbit effects are small compared to V (R) (see Fig. 2). In this case the total orbital angular momentum L of the electrons is coupled strongly toê n , such that L precesses rapidly aboutê n and only the projection Λ ≡ L ·ê n is well defined. Due to spin-orbit effects, the electron spin S precesses about Λ = Λê n and hence about the molecular axis; unlike L, however, S remains a good quantum number. The overall spin-orbit energy is determined by the average value of L · S, which depends on Λ and on Σ ≡ S ·ê n . Hence the good quantum numbers are Λ, S, Σ, and (redundantly) Ω ≡ Λ + Σ. Such a state is denoted with the molecular term 2S+1 Λ Ω . The example of a Hund's case (a) molecular state with a 1 Σ 0 term is perhaps the simplest type of molecule: it acts as a \"rigid rotor\" in which there is no net internal angular momentum, and hence J = R as described above.\n\nElectromagnetic fields can be used to modify the internal and motional states of molecules. The effects of such fields (energy level shifts or transition rates) are determined by the relevant matrix elements. Zeeman shifts can occur at 1 st order in perturbation theory. However, since the electric dipole operator connects states of opposite parity, the effect of electric fields always occurs at 2 nd order. Hence, the smaller energy scales associated with vibration and especially rotation in molecules can lead to a dramatic increase in response to electric fields, compared to atoms. Indeed, this qualitatively new feature is at the heart of many of the new types of control envisioned for ultracold molecules.",

A detailed description of the numerical details of this technique can be found in previous references [88][89][90][91][92][93][94], where the SQM approach has been employed to study atom-diatom reactions.

As we elaborate and motivate in the next section, and in contrast to the aforementioned \"conventional-wisdom\", such bond-breaking chemical reactions can be very sensitive to nuclear spin states, via Pauli transduction through the allowed molecular rotations. Our central conjecture is that symmetric molecules can only have a direct bond-breaking chemical reaction from a state with an orbitally symmetric wavefunction, i.e., with zero 'quasi-angular-momentum\" L quasi = 0, (e.g., the symmetric para-hydrogen). On the other hand, arXiv:1707.05320v2 [physics.chem-ph] 4 Oct 2017 a molecule constrained by Fermi/Bose indistinguishability to have a nonzero odd orbital angular momentum is precluded from breaking its bond by a \"Quantum Dynamical Selection\" (QDS) rule, a \"closed bottleneck\" in Hilbert space. Physically, this closed bottleneck is due to a destructive interference between the multiple possible bond-breaking processes -one for each of the symmetry related molecular orbital configurations. We emphasize that QDS is not of energetic origin, operational even if the molecule's rotational constant is much smaller than the temperature.\n\n\nC. Quantum coherence\n\nBefore exploring the role of quantum indistinguishability on chemical processes, we briefly comment on the important issue of quantum decoherence, the common prejudice being that rapid decoherence in a wet solution will render all quantum phenomena inoperative. Indeed, elevated temperatures will generally move a system towards classical behavior. For example, when a physical process oscillating with a characteristic frequency, ω, is immersed in a thermal environment, quantum effects will typically wash out for T≥ ω/k B . At body/room temperature it is thus only phenomena oscillating at very high frequencies (10 13 Hz, say, such as molecular vibrational modes) where quantum mechanics can modify the dynamics. But this argument implicitly presumes thermal equilibrium.",

Spin is an intrinsic property of the particle and not a consequence of any rotational motion. It is present even at a temperature of absolute zero, unlike rotational angular momentum which is a function of temperature. Every elementary particle has a particular spin quantum number S, which takes an integer or a half integer value. The angular momentum | L| of a particle due to its spin, is related to the spin quantum number S by | L| 2 = S(S+1) 2 . Spin also possesses a magnetic moment µ that is related to the spin quantum number by µ = γ L, where γ is defined as the ratio of magnetic moment to angular momentum of the particle of interest, and is called the gyromagnetic ratio. Again, there are 2S + 1 possible states with the same S but different m value that describes the z-component of spin angular momentum L z = m .\n\nThese states are all degenerate unless an external magnetic field is applied.

In accordance with the above discussion, one can obtain the energy of 3 P and 1 D terms, but not 1 S. This can be understood from a consideration of the fact that, in absence of spin-orbit coupling, all valid states of an atom must be simultaneous eigenfunctions of not only the Hamiltonian operator H, but also angular momentum operators L 2 , L z , S 2 , S z , as well as parity operator Π, such that any given state is characterized by the following quantum numbers L, M L , S, M S , π, associated with these operators. In traditional wave functional methods, these informations are carried by wave functions. But in DFT, the basic variable is electron density; so, in principle, it should be E xc [ρ], which should contain this dependence on these above quantum numbers.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the functionals in DFT depend solely in terms of charge or spin densities; therefore clearly lacking any of these mentioned quantities needed for a complete description of the state of an atom. Stated otherwise, we are facing a very important conceptual problem here: how can one describe the state of a many-electron system, which are eigenfunctions of all these operators working entirely in terms of density with no access to the correct N-electron wave function and its associated symmetry characteristics?\n\nThis problem is partially resolved by making reference to Slater's transition state theory [35,36]. Following this prescription, an ad-hoc approach to solve the multiplet problem was proposed, the so-called sum method [37,38]. Here the working equations are exactly like the KS equations, but density is assumed to correspond to a fictitious transition state where one or more orbitals are fractionally occupied. These authors argue that energy of a term, not representable by a single determinant, but requires a linear combination of determinants, can not be computed by spin densities of the corresponding state functions, but can be written as a weighted sum of determinantal energies as follows:\nE(M j ) = i A ji E(D i )(15)\nHere E(M i ), E(D i ) refer to the energies of different multiplets and determinants respectively.",

As a result, the 12 C(0 + 2 ) ⊗ p 1/2 and 12 C(0 + 2 ) ⊗ p 3/2 configurations are fragmented into many states. In the above discussion, we showed that there is no Hoyle-analogue state in the 1/2 − and 3/2 − states, where the strong attractive interaction between α-clusters and neutron induces the coupling with many different channels. On other hand, because the interaction between α and S-wave neutron is weaker than that for P -wave neutron, we expect that the 1/2 + state is promising candidate of the Hoyle-analogue state.\n\nThe calculated rms radii and S-factors are shown in Fig. 6.

We have performed such analyses for all nine TMO anions. Below, using the FeO − anion as a showcase, we illustrate how the entire calculation and analysis are carried out. To avoid redundancy, we will not describe other anions in detail here, but provides in the Appendix additional information for the cases where the analyses are not entirely trivial, such as CrO − , MnO − , and CoO − .

Such magnetic lattices with triangular motifs in them are good examples of geometric frustration. To see the significance of such triangular motifs, it is enough to note that the Neel (antiferromagnetic) state along any axis n is frustrated in the presence of such triangles, since there is no unique way of satisfying all the exchange interactions(Fig ) fully.In many situations [2], this results in a macroscopic degeneracy of classical minimum energy configurations. At intermediate temperatures T that are less than the exchange J, but are not small enough for the quantum mechanical nature of spins to matter, the spin correlations (measured, say, by neutron scattering experiments) in the system simply reflect this macroscopic degeneracy, and can be modeled in a universal way in terms of averages over an ensemble that gives a certain weight to each of these minimum energy configurations[3]. To a first approximation, this weight is of course uniform and the same for each minimum energy microstate, and the subleading effects of canonical fluctuations (that increase the energy from this minimal value) can also be included in a more sophisticated treatment. Many examples of such frustrated magnets are known. On the pyrochlore lattice, these include the Cu 2+ based S = 1/2 magnet paramelaconite [4] and the Cr 3+ based S = 3/2 magnets CdCr 2 O 4 and HgCr 2 O 4 [5]. Several interesting examples",

While most of the observed resonant features inthe photoionization spectra are seen in the calculated cross sections, some discrepancies can be noted. The observed resonance at 37.5 eV, belonging to 2 D o state, is shifted to the right (higher energy) by about 0.5 eV in the calculated spectrum. This may have resulted from some missing correlation configurations. Two resonances around 37.6 and 38.9 eV are also not found in the calculated cross sections. As these resonances were not seen in the high resolution ALS data, it is possible that they belong to some other states in the mixture.The resonance series have been identified in Refs.[5,7,6].

In these calculations, the SAFs were selected in the 2 B 1u , 2 B 2u , and 2 B 3u irreps of the D 2h group (nonrelativistic-type degenerate 2 P ground states belong to these irreps) because these doublets are strongly mixed by the SO interaction, resulting in the splitting of the ground 2 P state.

The resulting [4,4,4,3,2] basis set and GRECP parameters for Tl can be found on http://www.qchem.pnpi.spb.ru.\n\nFor the [4,4,4,3,2] basis set we have also performed MRD-CI calculations including SAFs from the 2 A u irrep and SAFs with quartet multiplicity ( 4 B 1u , 4 B 2u , 4 B 3u , and 4 A u ). In our calculations with different basis sets, their contributions have decreased the SO splitting by about 170 cm −1 and the total energy by about 2000 cm −1 .

[1][2][3] Many efforts have been made to uncover the pathways by which the P=O centre can react with nucleophiles. In general, two mechanisms have been proposed: S N 1@P, in which pentavalent three-coordinated species would be intermediates (Scheme 1a) 4,5 (in some papers it is described as EA -elimination-addition) and S N 2@P, which proceeds via a pentavalent pentacoordinated transition state or intermediate (Scheme 1b) 4,6 (in some papers denoted by AE -addition-elimination). The metaphosphate monoanion as a possible reaction intermediate has been discussed since 1955. 7 It was however concluded later that the phosphoryl transfer process is rather disinclined towards reaction by the dissociative S N 1@P mechanism -very rarely when Z was a carbon 3 atom. The dissociative mode of P-C (phosphorus-carbon) bond breaking could also be preferred in the case of very sterically hindered phosphorus compounds and especially in non-nucleophilic or very weakly nucleophilic solvents. Calculations have shown that a pentavalent tricoordinated structure cannot be an intermediate in aqueous media since water is too strong a nucleophile. 7 Such reactions were observed by Breuer and Mahajna in highly polar weakly nucleophilic non-aqueous media. 8,9 Water substitution generally proceeds rather by an associative mechanism S N 2@P with formation of a pentacoordinated pentavalent phosphorus structure. It resembles that occurring in bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions at saturated carbon atom and is called S N 2@P in line. If the transition state is long-lived enough to turn into an intermediate, then the mechanism is referred as S N 2@P, 10 (Scheme 1b). The intermediate can undergo pseudorotation 11 prior to departure of the leaving group and in such cases retention or inversion of configuration at phosphorus will be observed depending on the number of pseudorotamers. There has long been discussion in the literature on whether phosphorus amides or chlorides undergo hydrolysis via dissociative or associative mechanism. 5,12 Finally Harger and others",

YTTERBIUM ATOM\n\nThe ytterbium atom has the [Ba]4f 14 6s 2 closed-shell configuration in its ground state. However, the excited states of Yb belong to configurations which have excitations from both the 6s and 4f subshells. This means that a complete description of excited states of Yb is only pos- sible when the atom is treated as a system with sixteen valence electrons. There are many successful calculations in which Yb atom is treated as a two-valence electron system (see, e.g. [49][50][51]). In these calculations excitations are allowed only from the 6s 2 subshell while the 4f electrons are attributed to the core. Good quality of the results indicate that the states with excitations from 6s and 4f subshells usually do not strongly mix. However, this is not always the case. There is at least one known case when the mixing is important. This is the mixing between the 4f 14 6s6p 1 P o 1 state at E = 25068 cm −1 and the 4f 13 5d6s 2 (7/2, 5/2) o 1 state at E = 28857 cm −1 . The case is important due to the strong electric dipole tran-sition between ground and excited 4f 14 6s6p 1 P o 1 state. It strongly dominates in the polarizability of Yb [49], it can be used in cooling [52], etc. The experimental value for the electric dipole amplitude is 4.148 a.u. while two-valence-electron calculations give the value of 4.825 a.u.; the difference is due to the mixing of the two odd states [49]. This mixing cannot be accounted for in the two-valence-electron calculations.",

The electron configuration of carbon is1s 2 2s 2 2p 2 . In the excited state, four equivalent quantum-mechanical states are formed through the sp n hybridisation, which plays an essential role in four covalent carbon bonds. The stability of graphene is dependent on how tightly packed carbon atoms are from the sp 2 hybridization. Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor due to the conduction and valence band meet at the Dirac points (Nair et al. 2008). Fascinating properties of graphene arise from its high surface area combined with electronic and thermal conductivity and its mechanical strength. Due to the material's high surface area-to-volume ratio and high conductivity, it leads to significant improvements in many applications (Zurutuza et al. 2014).\n\nDue to the unique microstructures, graphene demonstrates special and always enhanced physiochemical properties. For instance, the Young's modulus and the intrinsic strength of graphene are around 1 TPa and 130 GPa, respectively. The room temperature electron mobility of graphene is 2.5 × 10 5 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . The thermal conductivity of the graphene is above 3000 W mK −1 (Nair et al. 2008). Graphene has been used to fabricate flexible electronics (Gorbachev et al. 2012), high-frequency transistors, and logic transistor (Britnell et al. 2012). In addition, single-layer and double-layer graphene products normally show optical transparency of 98% (Li et al. 2008a). With suitable design, graphene layers can become transparent simultaneously at high drive voltage.

The S-CH 3 -O angle is 174 • in model 1 and 170 • in model 2, which means that the methyl group approaches the acceptor in the plane defined by the carboxyl group. The S-CH 3 distance in both models is 2.3 Å, and the CH 3 -O distance is slightly shorter in model 1 than in model 2 (2.1 Å vs. 2.2 Å). The asymmetric methyl transfer transition state is characteristic for many methyltransferases, including salicylic acid methyltransferase, which, like LAMT, belong to the SABATH family of methyltransferases. The corresponding distances for the transition state of the reaction catalyzed by SAMT are 2.4 Å and 2.0 Å [28]. In the transition state for both models, the methyl group adopts a flat conformation, and the reaction itself proceeds with an inversion of configuration on the carbon atom. In both transition states, the interactions present in the system before the reaction are preserved. The carboxyl group of the substrate is oriented to accept the methyl group through interactions with glutamine 38, histidine 162 and tryptophan 163 ( Figures S7 and S8).\n\nAfter modeling both the initial structures and the transition state structures, the structures of the final state were determined.

The constraints imposed on the distance between the methyl group and the acceptor were removed, and the geometry of the system was optimized. Then, it was verified whether the system was an energy minimum by counting the eigenvalues.

We also introduce the RL concept of a policy which defines the agent's way of behaving at a given time. In a mathematical sense, the policy π is the mapping between \"states\" belonging to the environment and \"actions\" to achieve the agent's goal π : S → A. Put differently, the policy tells the agent how to behave at any point in time. The environment is defined as the landscape that is to be explored; with the state S defined as the set of all discovered points on the landscape or simply the current data available. The action A is defined as the agent choosing protein structures to run more simulations on. The user can provide different policies which differ in the reaction coordinates provided. By employing the sampling algorithm below, the user can evaluate which of these different policies ensures the most reward while sampling and then evaluate which reaction coordinates are relevant for sampling. To avoid any misunderstanding, the definition of \"states\" (S) here should not be confused with the common usage familiar to biophysicists to represent one particular protein configuration.\n\n1. Identify some sampling policy π K and its corresponding set of reaction coordinates K = {θ 1 , θ 2 , . . . , θ k }. These reaction coordinates could be based on known or likely reaction coordinates associated with the conformational transition under investigation.\n\nEach policy differs depending on the set of reaction coordinates and how new protein structures are chosen for each round of simulation. In our implementation for this work, the sampling policy involves choosing structures based on least populated clusters (performed at step 5, denoted as C p ) and the reward function of each cluster (Eq. 1) 2. Set the weight w i for each θ i ∈ K where w i ∈ [0, 1]. The initialization of each w i signifies which reaction coordinate θ i is important for the first round of sampling. Of course, if no prior knowledge is available regarding the importance of each weight, each w i can be fixed to the constant value of 1/k, where k is the total number of reaction coordinates for the given policy π K . Every iteration of this algorithm produces a new state S (the set of all discovered points), and since w i is different for each S, we will introduce new notation for the weights w S i .",

In a recent work [8], the energy spectrum of the SHE ion Lr + (Z = 103) was predicted using the relativistic Fock space coupled cluster (FSCC) method and the configuration interaction approach combined with many-body perturbation theory (CI + MBPT). The ground and the metastable excited states of Lr + stemming from the 7s 2 and 6d 1 7s 1 electron configurations, respectively, were identified together with the excitation scheme that is suitable for future LRC experiments [3]. In this work, we are focusing our interest on the energy levels and the spectroscopic properties of the SHE ion Rf + (Z = 104). The electronic structure of Rf is not trivial due to the complex combination of quantum interactions involving electron correlation, relativistic effects, and hyperfine structure [9,10]. Nonetheless, Rf has been in the spotlight of many theoretical investigations. Since the early 90s, several studies have been devoted to predictions of its energy levels [11], atomic radii [12], ionisation potentials [12], oxidation states, and chemical properties [13,14,15,16]. For the Rf + ion, to the best of our knowledge, very few theoretical data are found. FSCC calculations revealed the ground and some excited states belonging to the 6d 1 7s 2 and 7s 2 7p 1 configurations [17]. However, many levels were omitted, namely those originating from the metastable 6d 2 7s 1 configuration, due to the practical restriction of the FSCC method to systems of up to two valence electrons or holes, which leaves part of the Rf + energy spectrum out of the scope of this approach. Therefore, here we are in particular interested in going beyond the earlier work [17] by investigating the relative positions of the energy levels of the metastable 6d 2 7s 1 configuration, which are important for the development of optical pumping schemes for the Rf + ion in future LRC experiments [5,7].",

The original aim of the amorphous boundary conditions [2] was to keep the system surrounding the cavity within one fixed state (say α), one of the expo-nentially many metastable states the supercooled liquid phase is composed of [26]. According to this spirit, the external particles should be allowed to move enough to visit the many configurations belonging to state α, but not enough to reach configurations that do not belong to α. By choosing and fixing just one configuration within state α, however, we are over-constraining the amorphous boundary, and this may have some side-effects on the dynamics of small rearrangements in the cavity when a standard dynamics is used.\n\nIn view of this, it seems reasonable to try to relax the constraint on the outer particles by changing the current frozen configuration (FC) setup, in favour of a frozen state (FS) one. This means that instead of completely freezing the particles outside the sphere, we let them relax subject to the condition that the overlap q ext between the initial external configuration and the one at time t remains at some valueq ext . The FC setup would be recovered taking simultaneously the limits q ext → 1 and ℓ → 0. In this way, the external configuration is not allowed to move at all, so this amounts to a complete freezing 5 .",

However, if this transformation already occurs at lower temperature, the polymeric transition will be more difficult to detect with optical measurements alone because Fig. 3 shows that a band gap opens back up as the polymeric state is cooled. We now study the transformation into the polymeric state in more detail by analyzing the clusters in the fluid. Most simply, one can detect different polymerization reactions by analyzing the carbon atoms only. Using a distance cut-off of 1.8Å, we determined how many C n clusters were present in each configuration along different MD trajectories. Methane molecules are classified as C 1 clusters in this approach. Figure 4 shows a drop in the fraction of C 1 clusters as the system at 4000 K and 1.2 g cm −3 transforms into a polymeric state over the course of approximately of 3 ps.\n\nIn Fig. 5, we show a series of snap shots from the same DFT-MD simulation in order to illustrate how hydrocarbons chain of increasing length are formed.

The tendency for backward transfer of population, in general, would likely be reduced in a solvent by rapid dissipation of kinetic energy and thereby not be directly relatable to previous experiments. 18,[20][21][22] In contrast to the energies, the similarities in excitation character cannot at all be captured within a Franck-Condon picture. The effect is instead most clearly demonstrated by how intersystem crossing (ISC) is in the current case dominated by S 1 to T 2 transfer, which is El-Sayed forbidden as the two states share the same nominal electronic configuration. 71,72 The ISC must, therefore, be driven by symmetrybreaking in the structural dynamics, where the already noted similarity in both energy and localization of the n S and p S orbitals then allows for significant mixing of the electronic characters. Based on a single point calculation of the MECP geometry between the S 1 and T 2 states (which represents well the hopping geometries as shown in Sec. III C), we find as leading terms of the configuration expansions for the states S 1 ¼ 0:69ðn S ; p Ã Þ þ 0:58ðp S ; p Ã Þ and T 2 ¼ 0:73ðn S ; p Ã Þ À 0:58ðp S ; p Ã Þ. The two states are, thereby, essentially orthogonal in their spatial wave functions, similarly as expected for the \"El-Sayed allowed\" transitions, but consist, in contrast, of heavily mixed contributions from in-plane and out-of-plane excitation characters. Similarly, for a sampling over five randomly selected hop-inducing geometries (as introduced in the Sec. IIIC) for the same transition, the weight of the dominant configuration has a mean (standard deviation) of 0.63 (60.13) and 0.81 (60.14) for the S 1 and T 2 states, respectively.

The 'double symmetrical potential well' model indicates that the H + proton is frustrated in the two identical sites between adjacent oxygen atoms. The symmetrical double wells reduce to a single well when subjected to compression, which forces the fluctuating H proton into site midway between the two oxygen ions approaching the ice-X phase [88]. (Reprinted with permission from [89].) Figure 1b illustrates the evolution of the O:H-O bond symmetrical double-well potentials subjecting to compression [88]. Wernet et al.

The dihedral angle between the benzene (C9-C14) and pyran (O3/C2-C6) rings is 70.49 (6) . The carbon-nitrogen bond N1 C7 is 1.318 (2) Å , which agrees with values observed in related compounds . It is slightly longer than a typical C N bond [1.283 (4) Å ; Bai & Jing, 2007], but much shorter than a C-N bond. The N1-C9 bond length is 1.436 (2) Å because of resonance. The carboncarbon bond connecting the enol and imine groups exhibits intermediate distances between those of single and double bond, but being closer to the latter; C5-C7 = 1.427 (2) and C5-C6 = 1.443 (2) Å , reflecting the zwitterionic character of the title compound (Wojciechowski et al., 2003). The C4-O1 bond length [1.259 (2) Å ] is intermediate between single and double carbon-to-oxygen bond lengths (1.362 and 1.222 Å , respectively), whereas C6-O2 is 1.215 (2) Å .\n\nThe aromatic ring and dehydroacetic acid ring are in a trans position with respect to the C7 N1 bond, the dihedral angle between the two rings is 70.46 (9) and the molecular conformation is determined by the presence of the intramolecular N + -HÁ Á ÁO À hydrogen bond ( Fig. 1 and Table 1), which generates an S(6) ring motif. Similar intramolecular hydrogen bonds have been reported in other zwitterionic phenolates (Huang et al., 2006;Temel et al., 2006).",

In this figure, newly defined atom types B1-B4, and Cb are illustrated. Although all boron was regarded with the same properties, binding in the toward the equator (for example, B1, B2) and in the meridian direction (for example, B1-B4) should be distinguished for both the 12-vertex and 10-vertex carboranes. As atomic charges, restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) charges, 28) which are recommended for the AMBER  calculations, were used. To determine the parameters for van der Waals terms, energy profiles when methane or benzene approached the carborane were calculated using single-point energy calculations. Two approaching ways were examined (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2B, methane or benzene moved along carbon-carbon axis in the way \"I\" and in the way \"II\" methane or benzene approached the midpoint of boron-boron bond along the perpendicular of the carbon-carbon axis. In these calculations, benzene was fixed in a direction perpendicular to the carbon-carbon axis, and methane was fixed with face of the tetrahedron oriented toward the carborane cage. The energy profiles of bond stretching and angle bending for the substituents, which were located at the outer side of the polyhedral carborane structure, were determined by changing only the corresponding bond or angle or both using the same methods in Refs. 23-25. In the structural change involving the polyhedral structure, since a plurality of bond lengths, angles, and torsional angles are varied, the parameters should be calculated simultaneously using multiple regression. Three types of bond-stretching parameters must be determined for the polyhedral structure, that is, Cb-B1, B1-B2, and B1-B4. These bond-stretching parameters were obtained using the energy profiles for the expansion and contraction of carborane, in which only the bond lengths changed while maintaining all angles (Fig. 2C).

The stretching constitutes from 43 to 69% of the initial equilibrium bond length and further its elongation results in achieving R rad quite quickly. In contrast to the case, R cov on the N D (R) curves related to the double C-C bonds exceeds l eq only for ethylene molecule while for benzene and hexamethylbenzene R cov and l eq coincide. A further stretching over R cov opens the bond radicalization, the first stage of which is marked by approaching N D to 2 (clearly seen kinks on N D (R) curves in the region of 1.90-2.00Å). Then follows the second stage that is completed by a full radicalization of two molecular fragments formed at 2.60-2.70 Å. Therefore, in spite of a drastic difference in the behavior of the N D (R) curves related to either single or double C-C bonds, a full radicalization of the formed fragments occurs at 2.60-2.70Å in both cases. Answering the question put in the paper title, one should state that the covalent C-C bond is broken when its length achieves R rad . The value is practically the same for both single and double bonds and is located within the interval of 2.60-2.70Å. The bond break is followed by two prior-breaking periods of the bond elongation. The first period locates the interval between l eq and R cov , where the bond elongation, quite considerable for single bonds and small, if observable at all, for double bonds, does not change the bond character. The second period commences at R cov and concerns a gradual radicalization of the molecular fragments formed. The width of the period is quite short in the case of single bonds and, oppositely, quite large for double (and triple) covalent bonds. The feature is one of the most vivid exhibitions of the oddelectron character of the double C-C bonds that lays the foundation of all the peculiarities of the electron behavior in sp 2 nanocarbons [21].

Likewise, the shortening of the C 2 -C 3 (or C 4 -C 5 ) bond is compatible with the Coulomb attraction due to the extra charges of opposite sign on the C 3 and C 4 atoms (or C 3 and C 4 atoms). Nevertheless, our calculations reveal that variation of the bond lengths is not merely an electrostatic effect. The triple bonds C 1 ≡C 2 and C 5 ≡C 6 become longer although the atoms involved acquire extra charges of opposite sign which would imply an additional bond squeezing. Calculations also show that chemical intuition may be problematic even in a closed shell molecule like HC 6 H; inspection of Figs. 3(e) and 3(g) reveals a decreasing in the valence state of all carbon atoms although the extra negative charge of C 2 and C 5 has opposite sign to the extra (positive) charge of the other C atoms.

The polymer with low gel fraction behaves as an elastomer, whereas that with higher gel fraction displays rigid plastic properties.  Figure 1 presents the FTIR spectra.

We hypothesized that the access to annulation product 8 may proceed via a similar cascade cyclization reaction initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the N(CN) 2 ion (see fig. S8). X-ray diffraction analysis of 8 locates a five-membered and a three-membered azametallacycle fused with the ruthenapentalene skeleton (Fig. 4B). The Ru-N1 bond length is 2.021(3) Å, in accordance with an azaruthenacycle featuring Ru-N single bonds (51), whereas the Ru-C8 bond [2.213(3) Å] is slightly longer than the typical Ru-C bond length of a Ru-C=N moiety (1.962 to 2.177 Å). The carbonnitrogen bond lengths of the five-membered azametallacycle [C1-N2, 1.338(4) Å; C9-N1, 1.386(4) Å; C9-N2, 1.362(4) Å] are similar to each other and lie between the typical lengths of carbon-nitrogen single and double bonds, but the carbon-nitrogen distance in the threemembered azametallacycle is 1.283(4) Å. Thus, complex 8 has a delocalized structure with contributions from the two resonance structures 8A and 8B, as shown in Fig. 4A.\n\nThe rich reactivities of ruthenapentalyne 2 allow access to a series of unusual polycyclic ruthenacycles, with aromatic stability and structural complexity. We summarized the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of polycyclic ruthenacycles 2 to 4 and 6 to 8 in Fig. 5. All of them exhibit efficient absorption ranging from the UV-vis region. When the -conjugated framework is extended, the characteristic energy absorption bands are relatively red-shifted. The broad absorption, unique structures, and remarkable stability could facilitate further application of these polycyclic ruthenacycles.\n\n\nCONCLUSION",

The total energy was obtained by self-consistent calculation after the optimization of the geometric structure. A negative value for the binding energy manifests an exothermic process. The carbon atom that binds to the hydroxyl group moves upward, and the neighboring C−C bonds expand to nearly 1.500 Å. The distance is smaller than the average bond length of a C− C single bond (1.54 Å) but larger than that of a C�C double bond (1.34 Å). The bond length between the OH group and the carbon atom of the graphene sheet is about 1.530 Å, which is larger than the value of a typical C−O single bond (1. 43 Å). In addition, ∠CCC angles change from 120°to 113.30°, and the ∠OCC angle is about 101.79°. These results demonstrate that the carbon atom in the C−OH group undergoes a transformation from sp 2 hybridization to distorted sp 3 hybridization. In particular, the relaxation of the G1OH derivative with different orientations of the hydroxyl group produced the same result. The optimized structure of G1OH has the hydroxyl group tending toward the center of a hexagonal ring. The orientation of the hydroxyl group is mainly derived from the formation of a hydrogen bond between OH and π-electrons of graphene, O− H···π. Indeed, the adsorption of the OH group results in electron redistribution (Figure 1b). The electron density increases between the oxygen and the carbon atom, which is responsible for the C−OH bond. Besides, electron accumulation was seen between hydrogen and π-electrons of graphene, which is the consequence of the O−H···π bond formation. Furthermore, the calculation also shows that the binding energy of the G1OH derivative is about −1.17 eV/OH. In the previous study by Lahaye et al., 20 the binding energy obtained was only −0.7 eV.

These skeletal bands arise from the stretching of the carbon-carbon bonds in the ring structure. The lack of strong absorption bands in the 909-650 cm -1 region generally indicates a aliphatic structure. Aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds display strong outof-plane C-H bending and ring bending absorption bands in this region. The intermediate portion of the spectrum, 1300-909 cm -1 is usually correspond to the fingerprint region. The absorption pattern in this region is complex, with bands originating in interacting vibrational modes. Absorption in this intermediate region is probably unique for every molecular species. For example, in the cases of hydrocarbons, organic compounds classified as saturated or unsaturated based on the absence or presence of multiple bonds, the energy of the infrared light absorbed by a C-H bond depends on the hybridization of the hybrid orbital, in the order of sp 3 >sp 2 >sp. The sp 3 -hybridized C-H bonds in saturated hydrocarbons absorb in the 2850-3000 cm -1 region. The sp 2 -hybridized C-H bonds from alkenes absorbs at 3080 cm -1 . A sp-hybridized C-H bond in a molecule, alkyne absorbs infrared at 3320 cm -1 . Another classification of hydrocarbons can be made based on absorptions due to the carboncarbon bond. Carbon-carbon bond strength increases in the order of single>double>triple. Saturated hydrocarbons all contain carbon-carbon single bonds that absorb in the 800-1000 cm -1 region. But, unsaturated hydrocarbons also contain carbon-carbon single bonds that absorb in this same region.

Stretching can be defined as a periodic change in the distance between two bonded atoms. More precisely, it can be described as a periodic change in the bond's length between the two atoms. This normal mode of vibration can be further classified into symmetric stretching and anti-symmetric stretching. To elucidate these two subclasses, let us consider the water molecule H-O-H. This molecule has a nonlinear structure with two single covalent bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen atoms. In the symmetric stretching, the length of the single bonds increases and decreases simultaneously. In other words, the hydrogen atoms move to and away from the oxygen atom in a simultaneous way. While in the anti-symmetric stretching, one hydrogen atom moves towards the central oxygen, meanwhile the other one moves away from it. Bending can be described as a periodic change in the angles between two bonds while the bonds' length remains stable. Bending is also divided into four subclasses including rocking, scissoring, wagging, and twisting. To clarify these vibrational motions, let us consider the ethylene molecule H2C = CH2. In this molecule, a double covalent bond exists between the two central carbon atoms. Meanwhile, each carbon atom shares two single bonds with two hydrogen atoms. Rocking occurs when the two hydrogen atoms move clockwise or anticlockwise simultaneously and in the same plane around the central carbon atom. Therefore, the length of the single bonds remains stable. In addition, in exception to the previous bending rule, the angle between the two hydrogen atoms also remains unchanged. Scissoring happens when the hydrogen atoms move towards each other or away from each other in one plane. While in wagging, the hydrogen atoms move towards each other or away from each other out of planes. Finally, in twisting, a hydrogen atom moves forward while the other moves backward simultaneously and out of plane. Thus, in scissoring, wagging and twisting, the angle between the single bonds changes while their length remains constant [33,36,37].",

In principle, the dihedral angle is a balanced result of two factors; one is the spatial repulsion of the molecular segments as bridged by the double bond, and the other is the hydrogen bond of the carbonyl group with the hydrogen atom on the neighboring benzene. To further understand the photothermal process, the Laplacian bond orders (O) of the double bonds, 37 the bond length (d), and atomic partial charges (Q) derived using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) approach in S 1 V 0 (with a prime symbol) and S 0 V 0 (without a prime symbol) were calculated (Fig. 5, Tables 1 and S1 †).

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane.

Discrepancies between BBOA concentration events and simulated FIFs are particularly sensitive to the timing of emissions. At present, satellite observations from the overall GOES diurnal profile are used here as a first-order approximation that does not take into account the timing of individual fires and the length of smoldering emissions. Two FIFs were obtained by counting FLEXPART particles within a 9 by 9 km grid box centered on T0 extending from the surface to 2000 m above ground.

Single-particle level migrations were systematically studied through the measurements of ground-state nuclear spins and moments. Shell model calculations predict an inversion of the πp 3/2 and πf 5/2 levels, with the latter replacing the former as the ground state, as the νg 9/2 orbital is filled. This is due to the interaction between the proton and neutron levels caused by the monopole component of the tensor force [9,10].\n\n\nExperimental techniques\n\nLaser spectroscopy provides model-independent measurements of the nuclear spin, magnetic dipole moment, electric quadrupole moment and mean-square charge radius [11]. Coupled with shell model calculations, the nuclear moments in particular become a sensitive probe of the nuclear wave function. Collinear laser spectroscopy was performed on the COLLAPS [12,13] experimental set-up at ISOLDE, CERN. In most experiments, the isotopes were produced from proton bombardment of a thick target and extracted as a ∼ 30 keV ion beam, with the flux of the particular element under study selectively enhanced using the Resonant Ionisation Laser Ion Source (RILIS) [14]. Following mass selection, this ion beam was neutralised by passage through an alkali vapour cell before being overlapped with a co-propagating laser beam. A Doppler tuning potential was applied to the vapour cell, and photons detected using a photomultiplier tube (PMT) as the effective laser frequency was scanned.\n\nThe dominant source of photon background arises from the continuous scattering of laser light into the PMT, limiting the sensitivity of the technique. Use of the newly installed ISCOOL [15,16] cooler-buncher permitted ions to be accumulated and released in cycles of typically 100 ms duration. Each ion bunch emitted has a temporal length of the order of 10 µs, compressing the resonant photon signal into a time window 10 4 times smaller than the accumulation time. This allows a gate to be applied to the signal which conserves the resonant counts while suppressing the background from laser scatter by four orders of magnitude [17].",

The technical revolution behind FELs lies in the use of very long undulators arranged in a straight path so the X-rays are emitted in phase, as in a laser light beam. As the electrons travel on their slalom path through the undulator, they emit X-ray photons. The photons travelling in a straight line at the speed of light overtake the electron bunches and the electromagnetic field of the photons interacts with the electrons. Electrons that are in-phase with the photons get decelerated, while those out-of-phase are accelerated. Over the length of the long undulator, this process packs the electrons into micro-bunches that are overtaken by exactly one photon wavelength for each of their wave period. As a result, all the electrons of the micro-bunches radiate in synchrony, producing an extremely short, coherent and intense pulse of X-rays. At LCLS, the peak brightness at 8 keV is estimated to be greater than 10 32 photons s −1 mm −2 mrad −2 per 0.1 per cent bandwidth. This is 10 8 times greater than the radiation emitted by undulators on a third-generation synchrotron source. The pulse length is extremely short-it can be varied from 10 to 80 fs (1 fs = 10 −15 s) at 8 keV and X-ray flux is approximately 10 5 X-ray photons per Å 2 . The pulses are delivered at 30 Hz, a parameter that will be increased to 60 Hz and possibly 120 Hz. At LCLS, the 14.2 GeV FEL is placed in the last kilometre of a 3 km long tunnel (that was originally built to house a longer linear accelerator and which goes under Interstate Highway 280). The undulator length is 100 m (figure 4b). X-ray lasing was found to take place within a length of 60 m. The undulator length was overestimated to be on the safe side.",

Accordingly, hydrodynamic interactions are not considered here and dynamics of polymer chains in the absence of obstacles is of Rouse type.

Then we put the rod-like polymer in a random position with a random orientation inside the box and start the simulation.

Changing the background ionization level by two orders of magnitude only resulted in a 20% difference in the time it takes to cross the electrode gap. Also, changing the photo-ionization model to an artificial one with ten times less photo-ionization events has similarly small effects on streamer propagation.\n\n\nSimulations in 'pure' N 2\n\nWe now investigate streamers in nitrogen of high purity. In Nijdam's experiments [14], the impurity level was kept below 1 ppm. We here simulate an admixture of 1 ppm oxygen in nitrogen. The different ratios of nitrogen and oxygen change both the number of emitted photons and their absorption lengths. The artificially weakened photo-ionization from section 3.3 amounts to lowering the N 2 density for the purpose of photo-ionization, while keeping the overall gas pressure constant, as it results in a lower number of emitted photons. The other parameters in our photo-ionization model are the absorption lengths of the ionizing photons of different wavelengths. These lengths are inversely proportional to the O 2 density. The longest of these, denoted by l a , has the strongest effect on the non-local characteristics of the process. In artificial air at atmospheric pressure, we have l a = 1.3 mm. In N 2 with a 1 ppm admixture of O 2 , this absorption length is increased to 260 m. In cases where l a is much larger than the size of the modelled domain, the decay profile of O 2 ionization events as a function of distance from the photon source (the streamer head) is dominated by a r −2 falloff, with r the distance to the photon source. Figure 7 shows that in N 2 with a 1 ppm admixture of O 2 , both photo-ionization as well as a background ionization of 10 7 cm −3 can produce streamers. The propagation speeds are more similar than they are for the same scenarios in artificial air, which is an indicator of the lowered effect of photo-ionization: compared with air, the amount of ionizing photons produced is 25% higher in N 2 , but the characteristic absorption length is 2 × 10 5 longer.",

The localization length (Fig.3) represents the spatial localization of a given mode, and its maximal value corresponds to the half-size of the box. Beyond this length, the amplitude of the atomic vibrations decreases significantly. It can be seen in Fig.3 that contrarily to the participation ratio, the localization length remains unchanged at low frequencies as the Na concentration increases, and corresponds approximately to the half-size of the box. The low frequency modes appear therefore completely delocalized in space, but the number of particles involved in these vibrations decreases as the sodium concentration becomes higher as shown by the decreasing participation ratio. This means that in pure GeS 2 a large amount of connected particles were involved in the low frequency modes whereas in Na-Ge-S glasses, Na breaks these connections and therefore small groups of particles (small participation ratio) scattered in the whole simulation box (large localization length) participate in these modes with the consequence of a decrease of the density of states at low frequency.\n\n\nElectronic properties",

The bulk modulus of crystalline C 60 samples has been measured experimentally, 25-28 but the value for an isolated C 60 molecule under conditions of hydrostatic pressure is only known via simulations.

This value is approximately six times smaller than the value ∂∆A/∂P = 1.1(1) × 10 −4 Hz Pa −1 determined from the fit in Fig. 1. The discrepancy could have at least two causes. It may indicate that exchange interaction between the nitrogen and the cage, not captured by our van der Waals model, in fact contributes significantly to the nitrogen hyperfine coupling. Alternatively, the discrepancy could indicate that previous predictions have overestimated the fullerene's bulk modulus. To explain the measured pressure shift using Eq. 3 would require a value B = 140 ± 13, which is outside the range of theoretical predictions. However, these predictions themselves cover a wide range, which may indicate a need for further modelling. One source of uncertainty in the modelling is the effect of the solvent, which is expected to modify the molecule's bulk modulus. 14 In particular, the effect of toluene solvent has not yet been modelled.",

From the data, two population decay times of the lowest electronic excited state were determined to be 200 fs and 1.8 ps, which can be explained by the assumption that the 2 1 A g state lies below the exciton 1 1 B u state together with the very low fluorescence quantum efficiency. The relaxation process after excitation by the pump pulse was studied to be 1 1 B u → 1 1 B * u → 2 1 A g → 1 1 A g . According to the experimental data, the location of the energy level was also discussed. The electronic dephasing time was determined to be 64 ± 4 fs by utilizing the data in the 'negative time' range. The vibrational dephasing time constant of the most strongly coupled mode with frequency of 1466 cm −1 was determined to be 520 ± 20 fs from the widths of the corresponding Fourier power spectra.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThiophene-based oligomers can readily be synthesized [1]- [3] with different numbers of monomer units ranging from two to twelve or more.

An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

The other absorption channels are not only much weaker but also lead to the emission of electrons having much higher energies. Therefore, they can be easily separated from the main channel and in what follows will simply be ignored.\n\nNumbers of emitted photoelectrons: Assuming an electron detection efficiency of one we can estimate the number of recorded photoelectrons per pulse according to N pe = ∆xσ photo N γ ending up with about N pe (Cl K ) ∼ 10 3 .

On the other hand, it constrains a different combination of fundamental parameters. Most importantly, in atomic experiments the parameters g n and µ always go as a product g n µ, while here we have combination g n µ −1/2 . That allows to combine atomic results [4,35,37] with limit (37) to obtain the best laboratory limit on µ-variation: µ/µ = (3.4 ± 6.5) × 10 −14 yr −1 .\n\nThis limit is significantly weaker than astrophysical limit (1), but there are good chances that it will be soon significantly improved.\n\n\nVIII.

It was seen that longer laser pulses, with lower frequency dispersion, are more efficient for creation of well orbital resolved photoelectrons. Angular resolved distributions were plotted to observe real space propagation of photoelectrons at different pulse frequencies and propagation time.

We have used AMBER10 software package [19] with all atom (ff99SB) force field [20] to simulate the rupture event of DNA. A force routine has been added in AMBER10 to do simulation at constant force [21,22]. In this case, the force has been applied at 5 ′ − 5 ′ ends as shown in Fig.1. The electrostatic interactions have been calculated with Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method [23,24] using a cubic B-spline interpolation of order 4 and a 10 −5 tolerance is set for the direct space sum cut off. A real space cut off of 10Å is used for both the van der Waal and the electrostatics interactions. The starting structure of the DNA duplex sequence (GTCACCTTAGAC) is built using the NAB module of the AMBER10 suit of programs.

The four types of trial move were executed in random sequence at prescribed frequencies. Defining a cycle as an average of N m trial displacements (i.e., one per macroion), the other moves were attempted with relative frequencies per cycle of N m /2 for volume exchanges, N m /10 for macroion transfers, and N m /10 for salt exchanges. For inter-nal displacements, macroions were selected at random and moved with tolerances adjusted to yield an acceptance rate of about 50%. For volume and salt exchanges, acceptance rates of about 10% were achieved by adjusting the tolerances, the resulting salt tolerance being ∆N s /N s ≃ 10 −3 . After equilibrating for 10 4 cycles, we accumulated statistics for average densities, pressures, and chemical potentials over the next 10 4 cycles (5 × 10 6 displacements for N m = 500). From extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, Linse [35] has generated a wealth of data for the (salt-free) primitive model over ranges of macroion valence, volume fraction, and electrostatic coupling parameter, Γ = λ B /a. For direct comparison, we performed simulations of the effective onecomponent model for identical parameters -fixing the effective macroion valence (Z = 40), counterion valence (z = 1), and Bjerrum length (λ B = 0.72 nm), and varying the macroion radius a -and computed the macroion-macroion pair distribution function g(r) and pressure p, as described in the Appendix. For this purpose, we performed standard constant-N V T (one-box) simulations, the volume energy then having no effect on the pair structure. To obtain accurate g(r) results, a system size of N m = 600 sufficed to render finite-size effects negligible.

In contrast we immediately see from the Table and from Figure 5 that larger discrepancies are found between the two methods for doublet states. The equilibrium distance is now shorter by about 0.2a 0 in the FCI/ECP+CPP method, which could partly be accounted for the larger contribution of the core-core repulsion around 7.6a 0 than in the lowest states with a higher R e . While consistent in magnitude, the harmonic constants differ by about 4 cm −1 between the two methods, which could be reduced if we account for the short-range core-core term. The largest discrepancy concerns the well depth of the 3 2 Σ + and 2 2 Π states which is deeper by about 1000 cm −1 in the FCI/ECP+CPP results. The PEDM functions of Figure 6b reveal that while having similar trends, the details of the electronic wave functions induce significant differences in the oscillating patterns, i.e. in the relative weights of the configurations.

Nevertheless these TDMs deserve more attention. Asymptotically such transitions are in principle forbidden due to atomic spin-flip selection rule. Actually the 1 S → 3 P 1 excitation is allowed by electric dipole transition due to secondorder spin-orbit mixing with the higher 1 P 1 state, while the excitation towards the 3 P 0,2 states is strongly forbidden.

[3][4][5] This method has a rather high computational effort (6N-5 harmonic frequency evaluations with N being the number of atoms in the system) but at the same time considers only local curvature information close to the minimum. For this reason VPT2 approaches are known to be of limited accuracy in case of strongly anharmonic potentials (e.g., OH bonds) which have been recently confirmed in joint experimental and theoretical investigations. [6,7] A further widely employed method is the so-called Vibrational Self Consisting Field (VSCF) [8][9][10][11] approach. This method uses, in analogy to Hartree-Fock SCF, an ansatz which by definition strongly approximates coupling of different modes. Various improved VSCF approaches have been formulated focusing on higher accuracy [12][13][14][15] and a computational efficient procedure. [16][17][18][19][20][21] While VSCF and its extensions are based on grid data that is typically interpolated to obtain a continuous representation of the potential energy surface, there exist different families of grid-based methods evaluating the wave functions only on the provided data-points. These methods lead to reliable results with comparably small computational effort. [6,7,[22][23][24][25] The latter are not limited to problems in vibrational spectroscopy, but have also been applied in approaches to describe the electronic density in atoms and small molecules. [26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33] ] Among these is the so-called Numerov method, [34,35] which was shown to predict the experimentally determined vibrational frequencies of H 2 and H 2 O within 1 cm −1 (≤0.1)% using correlated ab initio based potential energy information. [36] Also density functional theory (DFT) at hybrid level [37,38] combined with the Numerov scheme proved highly accurate in predicting the IR fundamental and first overtone of the OH-vibrational modes of methanol and phenol, especially under gas-phase conditions where a deviation of <0.5% was achieved.

The Markov approximation leading to Eq. (11) completely neglects any correlation between forces at different times and essentially only contains thermal fluctuations. That the Markov approximation has a classical flavor can be seen in the low temperature limit where the fluctuating forces vanish. The Langevin equation with a harmonic potential then gives rise to a decaying average energy: E(t) = E 0 e −ηt/M which is not allowed quantum mechanically, since the average energy can not become less than the zero point energy. This paradox is solved by going beyond the Markov approximation where a small fluctuating force exactly cancels the frictional decay. To get an idea of the range of temperatures where the Markov approximation works, we can estimate the correlation time by t c = /k B T . [19] The timestep used in the molecular dynamics in this work was 1 f s which corresponds to T = 2900 K and this gives an estimate on the lower temperature limit to the Markov approximation. Memory effects in non-adiabatic dynamics will be explored further in a future paper.\n\n\nVI. SUMMARY\n\nWe have analyzed the effect of including zero point motion properly in Langevin dynamics with a temperature dependent friction tensor. The method which involves initial phase space sampling, have been compared to a quasiclassical approach where classical initial conditions matching the zero point energy is used. For a harmonic oscillator, the initial conditions is the only quantum mechanical correction since the quantum dynamics becomes classical and we have shown how to obtain vibrational probabilities from the classical energy distribution resulting from Langevin dynamics with phase space sampling. As expected, the result agrees extremely well with an inherently quantum mechanical master equation approach when the initial conditions is included correctly, whereas the quasiclassical approach only tends to a reasonable result after ∼ 1 ps of interaction. We have also compared the results of using quantized and quasiclassical initial conditions in a Morse potential and found only a little effect on the probability for escaping the potential well. The reason for this can be attributed to the fact that the escape probabilities involves a sum over the continuous set of free states and the quasiclassical approach yields a good description of average quantities.",

An important consequence of the expressions obtained in present paper is the possibility obtaining these date of matrix elements compared to the number of calculations using numerical methods. Even for comparatively light diatomic molecules (except the hydrogen molecule and hydrides) using the obtained expressions allows reduce the number of necessary calculations more than one order of magnitude.\n\n\ndiagram technique describing the actions of the annihilation operator at the consideration of vibrational dependences of matrix elements has been developed. The algebraic formulas for the matrix elements with arbitrary values of the vibrational quantum numbers of the combining states for arbitrary sufficiently differentiable functions of the internuclear distance are obtained in terms of matrix elements on the wave functions of the ground vibrational state. These formulas for the case of anharmonic potential curves were previously absent in the literature known to us. It is important to emphasize that proposed method for determining of vibrational dependences of matrix elements is a direct, simple and intuitive unlike the techniques developed earlier and does not require using any special theories of quantum mechanics (hypervirial, Hellmann-Feynman and others) and hypergeometric functions. The only required information reduces to knowing the explicit form of the annihilation operator and the wave function of the ground vibrational state of the molecule.

In all cases the program worked without any modifications. Also for s-wave problems with barriers, where the bifurcation does not happen at the origin, the program was able to detect the bifurcation point, the tangent directions and follow the solution curves that emerge from the bifurcation point. For all these problems the complete curve was found within seconds. However, we have found it hard to trace resonances when they move far down in the complex plane into the region with large negative imaginary momenta. In this region, the fundamental solutionsĥ + l andĥ − l are increasing and decreasing exponentials with a slight oscillation. In our shooting method that integrates outwards starting from r = 0 the exponentially increasing function will dominate over the decreasing function. This effect becomes more difficult to deal with if R, the end of the domain, is increased. A possible solution to this problem might be to use a mismatch function where two shootings, one from the left and one from the right, are matched. The shooting from the right would then havê h + l (kR) as boundary condition. It is the question, however, if the mismatch function is suitable for pseudo-arclength continuation near the bifurcation point.\n\nThe proposed method is, however, independent of this solver and can be built around any solver of the radial Schrödinger equation.

A series of calculations of the M parameter was performed using Eq. (7) with basis functions going up to p, d and f harmonics. We found (see Table I) that including only s and p functions in the expansion determines M with 90% accuracy. Because the contribution of f is only about 0.3% and amplitudes of higher harmonics on the nucleus are suppressed by the leading term ∼ r (j−1/2) , the error due to the neglect of spherical harmonics beyond f is estimated to be below 0.1%. Calculation of the X parameter requires s and p harmonics (see Ref. [7]), although, strictly speaking, d harmonics also give nonzero contributions.\n\nThe restoration procedure implemented here gives a very good description of the wave function in the core region, which is important for accurate evaluation of the X and M parameters. This is done at a fraction of the cost necessary for all-electron four-component molecular calculations with Gaussian basis sets, where a large number of additional basis functions must be included for proper description of the inner core region and small components of spinors [7]. Here we calculate (restore) the four-component electronic wave function in the core region from the (pseudo)wave function obtained in the molecular GRECP calculation, which may be considered \"frozen\" in the valence region at the restoration stage.

The derivative of the energy with respect to λ gives the computed property. This is strictly correct only at the limit of vanishing λ, but it is usually possible to find a range of λ values where the energy is linear with λ and energy changes are large enough to allow sufficient precision. The quadratic dependence on λ is eliminated in the present calculations by averaging absolute energy changes obtained with λ of opposite signs.",

The matching condition is then D(E) = 0. If D(E) is assumed to be meromorphic then a region bounded by a contour should show N zeros for N valid resonances. Because poles in the same region will 'cancel' zeros then it is important to use relatively small contours such that each region can be assumed to contain only a single zero or pole. Additionally, the matching point R m for the function D(E) must be placed so that it is within the classically permitted R region of the resonance state wave function. For resonances that extend into short interatomic distances a single value of R m = 100 a 0 is sufficient to lie within the outer turning point of these resonances. Long-range resonances, however, require multiple scans at different R m values in order to detect all resonances because the classically allowed regions of the different wave functions may not overlap. The results in this paper originated from scans using matching distances of 100, 200, 400 and 600 a 0 .",

The SAPT potentials predict the highest binding energies whereas the LM2M2 and TTY predictions are very close to each other and are the lowest ones. The differences observed in the binding energy are reflected in the mean values of the radius, < R > and < R 2 >, as well as in the scattering length a 0 . The estimate bond length < R > can be directly compared to the experiment and can be also used for an estimation of the binding energy |E b | and the scattering length a 0 through the relations given in the first paragraph. Those values are shown in the last two rows of Table I and reasonably agree with the estimation of Ref.

One of which is that it forbids instantaneous action at a distance. For example, in the Newtonian theory of gravity the sun and the earth attract each other instantaneously even though they are separated by ~150 Gm. More pressingly for chemical applications, Coulomb's law cannot be the correct description of the interactions between electrons or between electrons and the nucleus as, again, this assumes instantaneous action at a distance.

This magnificent gothic church is decorated with a single equation 2 :This is the Dirac equation (in an extremely compact notation), which is engraved on a commemorative plaque to Paul Dirac, who, by writing down this equation, unified quantum mechanics with the special theory of relativity. In so doing Dirac also predicted the existence of antimatter and gave a natural explanation of spin (intrinsic angular momentum), which is a somewhat artificial addition to non-relativistic quantum theory.Before discussing the Dirac equation, let us briefly outline the tension between the Schrödinger equation and special relativity. Recall that, in the absence of an external potential, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation iswhere is the reduced Planck constant, and , is the wavefunction, which, in general, varies in both space, , and time, . Note that the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is a second order differential equation with respect to space, but only first order with respect to time, i.e., the spatial derivative appears as / , / , / but the time derivative only appears as / .

INTRODUCTION\n\nWith the advent of the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach 1-4 in (non-relativistic) quantum chemistry 5-17 , approximate solutions for a complete-active-space (CAS)-type problem within chemical accuracy became computationally feasible on a routine basis albeit the fact that variational optimization merely involves a polynomial number of parameters. The combination with a self-consistent-field orbital optimization ansatz (DMRG-SCF) [18][19][20][21][22] makes active orbital spaces accessible that surpass the CASSCF limit by about five to six times. Yet, the construction of a (chemically) meaningful active orbital space poses a fundamental challenge that calls for automation [23][24][25][26] . In contrast to early work on ab initio DMRG 3 , recent efforts on the quantum-chemical DMRG algorithm 4 focused on a variational optimization of a special class of ansatz states called matrix product states (MPSs) 27,28 in connection with a matrix-product operator (MPO) representation of the quantum-chemical Hamiltonian 17,[29][30][31][32] .\n\nCombining the principles of quantum mechanics 33 and special relativity 34 into relativistic quantum mechanics, Dirac 35 put forward a (one-electron) theory which constitutes the central element of relativistic quantum chemistry 36,37 . In this framework, deviations in the description of the electron dynamics increase compared to (nonrelativistic) Schrödinger quantum mechanics as one considers electrons moving (in the vicinity of a heavy nucleus) at velocities close to the speed of light. Consequently, the differences between results of relativistic quantum calculations employing a finite and an infinite speed of light, respectively -which are for the latter case equivalent to results from conventional nonrelativistic calculations based on the Schrödinger equation -can serve as a definition for the chemical concept of \"relativistic effects\".",

[23] For the purpose of our discussion of X-ray structure factors, these are dominated by the relativistic contractions of the inner electronic shells of the atoms due to the non-classical speed of the according electrons. For isolated atoms, one may estimate the ratio of the non-relativistic and relativistic orbital radius (r 0 and r r , respectively) in atomic units according to\nr 0 r r = 1 − Z n · c 2 − 1 2 = m r m 0(1)\nby considering the relativistic mass increase of the electrons (see, for example [30][31][32]). This ratio can be expressed by the atomic number Z, the main quantum number n of an atomic orbital and the speed of light c or by the ratio of the relativistic mass m r compared to the mass m 0 at zero velocity. Equation (1) yields an estimated relativistic contraction ∆r = r 0 /r r of the 1s atomic shell by 2, 6 and 22% for a Ni, Pd and Pt atom, respectively. The according values may be verified on the basis of scalarrelativistic atomic ab-initio calculations by determining the shift of the outermost local maxima in the radial distribution function D(r) = 4πr 2 ρ(r) of the individual electronic shells defined by their main quantum number n (see Figure 1). From these shifts one obtains a relativistic contraction of ∆r = 21.3, 9.9, 4.6 and 2.5% for the n = 1, 2, 3 and 4 shell of a Platinum atom, respectively, where the value of 21.3% is in very good agreement with the estimated value of 22% specified above. We note at this point, that within the present study we will not consider the different radial extensions of the spin-orbit coupled spinors.

Full T and perturbative (Q) contributions were thus calculated in a smaller correlation space containing the valence electrons (Rn: 5d, 6s, 6p; Og: 6d, 7s, 7p) with a virtual orbital cutoff of 14 a.u. and 16 a.u. for Og and Rn, respectively, corresponding to equally sized correlation spaces. These calculations were performed with the program package MRCC [36,37,38,39,40] linked to DIRAC15 [41] using Dyall's augmented valence avX z basis sets [27]. The DIRAC15 version was used due to its compatibility with the MRCC code. The ∆T contributions were extrapolated to the CBS limit as above and an additional core-valence correction to ∆T was calculated at the (1-aug)-cv2z level. ∆(Q) contributions, showing almost no basis set dependence, were calculated at the (1-aug)-v3z level. We next turn to improving the treatment of relativity in our calculations. The one-electron part of the DC Hamiltonian is relativistic, while the Coulomb operator can be considered as a non-relativistic description of the 2-electron interaction.

Therefore the relativistic Bohr radius, , is smaller than the non-relativistic Bohr radius, :\n1 * 1 1 ,\nwhere is the fine structure constant and is the atomic number. This means that fast moving electrons will have their average distance from the nucleus reduced. This increases the strength of their Coulomb interaction with the nucleus and hence increases their binding energy. This is known as the direct effect [79,80]. The electrons that travel the fastest are those that spend the most time near the nucleus. The amount of time an electron spends near the nucleus is determined, to first order, by its angular momentum; this can easily be understood by considering the classical analogues of orbits of different angular momenta (see Figure 3).\n\nAs s-electrons have 0: they carry no angular momentum. Classical motion with no angular momentum is rectilinear, that is motion in a straight line back and forth through the nucleus. Thus, p-electrons ( 1) have the smallest possible non-zero angular momentum; therefore the classical analogue of a p-electron's orbit is motion in a highly eccentric ellipse. As is increased the eccentricity of the ellipse is reduced. However, circular motion is only found in the limit → ∞ for 1, cf. Figure 3. Therefore the direct effect is strongest for s-electrons and weakens as increases. The principal quantum number, , also has an effect on the size of the direct effect, with larger reducing the size of the direct effect (because the requirement for orthogonallity with other wavefunctions of the same suppresses the amplitude at the nucleus) [81].\n\nThe direct effect binds electrons more tightly to the nucleus. This means that electrons more effectively screen one another from the nucleus. Hence, electrons become more weakly bound to the nucleus, which is known as the indirect effect [79,80]. Clearly, the indirect effect is largest for those electrons that spend most of their time far from the nucleus, i.e., the size of the indirect effect increases as increases.",

It is also important to note that, in our molecular imaging studies below, it only suffices to consider that electrons interact with the specimen molecules exclusively as a wave and not as particles except when they hit the detector where each electron is recorded as a dot.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILSWe employ the Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) code 41 for first-principles calculations based on density functional theory along with both fully relativistic and scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials. While the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has profound effect in modifying electronic properties of a material containing heavy elements, it has only weak effects on vibrational frequencies due to different energy scales associated with spin-orbit coupling and vibrational energy of the ions. As a consequence, the magnitude of the phonon frequen-cies does not change significantly and the character of the vibrational modes also remains unchanged with omission of the SOC. Effect of spin-orbit coupling is included in our firstprinciples calculations by constructing relativistic pseudopotentials from the solution of the Dirac equation instead of non-relativistic Schrödinger equation. We have used relativistic pseudopotentials in determination of electronic structure of Bi 2 Se 3 and scalar-relativistic (average of the former) pseudopotentials for calculating its vibrational properties. By scalar relativistic pseudopotentials, we mean that the pseudopotentials are constructed taking into account the mass-velocity correction term and the Darwin term in the higher order (in order of v 2 /c 2 , where v and c are velocity of electron and speed of light, respectively) expansion of the Dirac equation while excluding the spin-orbit coupling term. We adopt the self-consistent density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) 42 available within the QE distribution in calculation of vibrational frequencies. We approximate the exchange-correlation energy with a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) 43 and use the functional parameterized by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) 44 .

The De Broglie wavelength is produced as a consequence of the intrinsic resistant to be moved, showed by flat fermions. Also flat fermions use the two coordinates of flatland to travel (see Fig. 3). Flat photon is not resistant to be moved and its SEFPP uses one dimension less from the two available in that space to travel (see Fig. 4). Since real photon has no mass but real fermions do have it: The dimensional condition to have mass is that the object intersection in a given space, should use the same number of dimensions that has such a space. As mass occurs when all the dimensions of a given space are used, it exerts a tension on that space, bending it, just as a light metal ring bends the surface of the water when floats on it. Furthermore, if the area of the object is bigger, it will exert less tension on the water surface (2D space), which will tolerate it better. This supports also that the flat electron (less mass but bigger Compton wavelength) is bigger than the flat proton as it has been discussed. In the case of objects that occupy n-1 dimensions from the space they intersect, such tension does not occur and the bending effect is not produced, which is the case of the flat photon. As one can see this concept of mass is consistent with what is proposed by the general theory of relativity [30], and it is kinetic independent [31].\n\n\nSelf-interference and the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics",

In this case, TI requires to reversibly insert or remove a proton in the system. The insertion of electrons in the simulation can be automatically localized in the lowest state thanks to the SCF convergence. However, protons cannot be automatically located in the simulation. Therefore, when conducting simulations for deprotonation reactions, the proton is not simply removed from the system in each MD step, but replaced by a classical dummy at the same location. The dummy has neither coulombic nor van der Waals interactions with other molecules, which implies that it can be anywhere within the system during the simulation. This can lead to unphysical configurations of the solute in the solvent, including overlap with other molecules, deeming computation impossible. A conventional approach to avoid this problem is to apply a harmonic restraining potential on the dummy. 33 For example, to compute the solvation energy of a proton, the dummy is bonded with a water molecule in a hydronium-like structure. 34 In summary, to calculate the free energy of moving a proton from HX molecule in the solution to the gas phase, we need four steps. 35 First, TI is used to calculate the deprotonation energy, DA HX/X À. Here, the proton on the HX molecule is replaced with a dummy, and the new molecule is denoted as dX À . Then, we estimate the zero-point energy of the ground state H-X vibration (DE H(X) ), and add the free energy of the proton in the gas phase, i.e., the translational energy (k B T ln(c o L 3 ), with L the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the proton, k B the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature in Kelvin) of the monoatomic gas in equilibrium with a standard concentration in the solution (c o = 1 M). Finally, as in eqn (7), the energy correction q HX/X ÀÁV 0,HX/X À needs to be included due to the uncertain reference of electrostatic potential in the charged system (the dX À molecule).

Similarly as for the nonrelativistic energies, the relativistic contributions are divided into the valence and core components. In the case of the two-electron relativistic corrections, D 2 and B , we neglect the core contribution. This is justified because the two-electron contributions are by an order of magnitude smaller than P 4 and D 1 terms, and the core components are further by an order of magnitude smaller than the valence effects. This was verified by carrying out FCI calculations in small basis sets. We estimated that the neglected terms would bring a contribution of only about 0.01 cm −1 to the interaction energy at the minimum of PEC. Thus, they are entirely negligible in the present study, cf. Ref. [23]. Nonetheless, we add an additional uncertainty of 5% to the calculated two-electron relativistic effects due to the neglected core contributions which is probably a very conservative estimation.\n\nExtrapolations of the relativistic corrections to the complete basis set limit are performed with help of Eq. (3). The only exception is the two-electron Darwin term where the l −1 convergence pattern is found. This is consistent with the numerical experience of Refs. [56,57] and theoretical findings of Kutzelnigg. 58 In all cases the errors are estimated as the difference between the extrapolated result and the value in the largest basis set.\n\nThe valence relativistic corrections are evaluated with the help of the FCI method.

An approximately 10 μM solution of the dried powder of the holmium acetylacetonate microspheres in methanol was injected and ionized using electrospray ionization (ESI) to generate positively charged holmium complexes (see Figure S1 and S2). After isolation of the precursor ion of interest, the ions were irradiated with two 6 μs long macropulses from FELIX at a repetition rate of 10 Hz, each pulse having an energy of 20-100 mJ and a bandwidth of about 0.5% of the center frequency. Wavelength dependent absorption of infrared radiation increases the internal energy of the precursor ion, until the dissociation threshold is reached and the precursor ion dissociates (see Figure S3). The wavelength dependent fragmentation is converted into an IR spectrum by calculating the fragmentation yield: -ln(1 -∑I(fragment ions)/∑I(all ions)) 30 . This yield is linearly corrected for wavelength dependent variations in laser power and the wavelength is calibrated using a grating spectrometer.\n\n\nComputational methods\n\nDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out in Gaussian16 31 , using the B3LYP density functional.

However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a ´ of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of °{™ to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing ³ is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to Δ . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 µm, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016].

Some studies were carried out in the context of relativistic effects and corresponding changes in periodic trends, where the dependence on the fine structure constant is considered [25,26]. More recently, King et al. investigated the dependence of structure and bonding in small molecules on both α and µ, with the objective of finding the hypothetical (α, µ) regimes that support biochemistry and therefore life on our planet [27]. Brax-maier et al. [28] performed an investigation of the variation of the resonance frequencies of monolithic crystal cavities with possible variation of fundamental constants through the dependence of the refractive index of the medium on α and µ. To the best of our knowledge, no prior investigations of direct size dependence of bulk materials on fundamental constants have been carried out.\n\nIn non-relativistic physics the size of molecules and solids is proportional to the Bohr radius a B . This dependence cancels out in the ratio of the sizes. The individual dependence of different compounds on the fine structure constant is determined by the difference in the relativistic effects, which are proportional to Z 2 α 2 (and higher powers of Z 2 α 2 ). Thus, considering the ratio of the resonance frequencies in two optical cavities made from different materials, in the non-relativistic approximation there is no dependence on α, but such dependence appears due to relativistic corrections.\n\nThe situation is different when we compare the resonance frequency of an optical cavity with an atomic optical frequency. For example, one measures the ratio of the Sr atomic clock frequency and the resonance frequency in a silicone cavity of length L [8]. Here, the ratio is proportional to α already in the non-relativistic approximation since the resonator frequency depends on the speed of light c. Indeed, the resonator frequency is ω r = ck ∼ c/λ ∼ c/L ∼ c/a B , atomic frequency ω a ∼ e 2 / a B , therefore ω a /ω r ∼ e 2 / c = α. In this case, relativistic corrections produce additional α dependence.\n\nAnother dimensionless ratio which affects the properties of different compounds is the ratio of nuclear and electron masses; the nuclear mass is approximately proportional to the proton mass, and thus we consider the proton-to-electron mass ratio µ.",

REPs/PPs have the advantage of bypassing much of the complexity and subtlety involved in using the all-electron, two-component Hamiltonians as well as reducing the system size in many-body calculations. Furthermore, they have been demonstrated to produce accurate results when combined with an appropriate many-body method, as shown via direct comparisons with experiment. REPs/PPs are often published along with systematically convergent basis sets which allow an extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit to be performed.\n\nThe AFQMC method has demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in both molecules and materials, as well as in lattice models of strongly correlated materials such as the Hubbard model. AFQMC has recently been extended to include SOC and demonstrated in model systems [23][24][25].\n\nIn the present work, we extend the adaptation of AFQMC including SOC directly to realistic ab initio Hamiltonians. We focus on two-component REPs/PPs which explicitly include the spin-orbit coupling operator as opposed to two-component relativistic all-electron Hamiltonians; however, all-electron Hamiltonians can be used in the formalism presented here with no modifications at the AFQMC level of theory.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide theoretical background on the relativistic quantum many-body problem, as well as a brief overview of AFQMC for ab initio calculations. We also detail the modifications to the typical AFQMC formulation to include SOC. In Section III, we describe several test applications of the ab initio AFQMC approach including SOC, compared with corresponding scalar relativistic calculations. We begin with the calculation of the electron affinity (EA) of lead, followed by the dissociation energy of heavy-elements dimers.

[169] solved their model exactly (full CI) and were able to show that the solutions in the single excitation configuration interaction (CIS) approximation reproduce these results extremely well. As CIS is of similar quality to the approximations made in, for example, linear response TDDFT [169,170], this gives one hope that TDDFT may be accurate enough to capture the important correlation effects in the complexes discussed in this review.\n\nIt is important to note that in the pseudo-angular momentum model correlations only act to change the values of the parameters. Therefore the main conclusions of this model are independent of the degree to electron correlations.\n\n\nDensity functional approaches\n\nThe majority of density functional calculations described below take one of two approaches to including scalar relativistic effects: either including them directly by solving the one-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham equations, cf. section 2.4, or by employing relativistic pseudopotentials, see, e.g., [171][172][173]. There have also been a few benchmarking solutions of the two-and four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham equations. In the pseudopotential approach one does not treat the core electrons explicitly, rather one replaces the core electrons and the atomic nucleus by an effective core potential or pseudopotential. Relativistic pseudopotentials adjust this potential so as to reproduce the energy shifts that result from scalar relativistic effects, such as the direct and indirect effects [173].\n\nRelativistic pseudopotential (TD)DFT calculations can be of similar accuracy to scalar relativistic (TD)DFT calculations, although there are a number of subtle issues at play [173]. In general scalar relativistic calculations are no more expensive than non-relativistic calculations. However, the fact that core electrons are not explicitly included means that relativistic pseudopotentials, like non-relativistic pseudopotentials, do result in a speed up over all electron calculations. The frozen core approximation therefore results in a similar speed-up for scalar relativistic calculations. A major advantage of performing scalar relativistic calculations is that this allows for a straightforward, unbiased 'apples to apples' comparison with nonrelativistic calculations. This allows one to understand the role of scalar relativistic effects in a material.",

To the best of our knowledge, no prior investigations of direct size dependence of bulk materials on fundamental constants have been carried out.In non-relativistic physics the size of molecules and solids is proportional to the Bohr radius a B . This dependence cancels out in the ratio of the sizes. The individual dependence of different compounds on the fine structure constant is determined by the difference in the relativistic effects, which are proportional to Z 2 α 2 (and higher powers of Z 2 α 2 ). Thus, considering the ratio of the resonance frequencies in two optical cavities made from different materials, in the non-relativistic approximation there is no dependence on α, but such dependence appears due to relativistic corrections.The situation is different when we compare the resonance frequency of an optical cavity with an atomic optical frequency. For example, one measures the ratio of the Sr atomic clock frequency and the resonance frequency in a silicone cavity of length L [8]. Here, the ratio is proportional to α already in the non-relativistic approximation since the resonator frequency depends on the speed of light c. Indeed, the resonator frequency is ω r = ck ∼ c/λ ∼ c/L ∼ c/a B , atomic frequency ω a ∼ e 2 / a B , therefore ω a /ω r ∼ e 2 / c = α. In this case, relativistic corrections produce additional α dependence.Another dimensionless ratio which affects the properties of different compounds is the ratio of nuclear and electron masses; the nuclear mass is approximately proportional to the proton mass, and thus we consider the proton-to-electron mass ratio µ.In this work we present a systematic investigation of arXiv:1809.02863v2 [physics.chem-ph]",

The first category includes the effects that contribute to the shielding tensor of a light atom due to a neighboring heavy atom, that is, the HALA effect. The second category comprises the relativistic corrections to the shielding tensor of a heavy atom itself, i.e., the HAHA effect [25]. There are typically five contributions to the HAHA effect that are regarded as the leading-order corrections to the shielding constant of a heavy nucleus [90,[93][94][95]. These are the so-called scalar corrections, σ p−KE/OZ , σ p/mv , σ p/Dar , and two types of spin-orbit corrections, σ FC/OZ/SO and σ SD/OZ/SO . The three scalar corrections can be thought of as the terms originating from the mixing of the electron spin-independent (or spin-free) PSO (p) or PSO-KE (p-KE) operator with the spin-free relativistic operators, such as the orbital-Zeeman (OZ), mass-velocity (mv), and Darwin (Dar) terms. At the same time, the two spin-orbit corrections, σ FC/OZ/SO and σ SD/OZ/SO , are the terms originating from the crossing of the hyperfine spin-dependent operators FC and SD with the OZ operator and the spin-dependent spin-orbit (SO) operator. The latter reflects the interactions of the electrons' spins with the magnetic moments, generated by their orbital motions around the nuclei. The HALA effect also consists of different types of scalar and spin-orbit corrections, though the main part of the spin-orbit HALA (SO-HALA) effect is usually due to the spin-orbit term σ FC/OZ/SO . Thus, bearing this in mind, we will refer to the σ FC/OZ/SO term when reasoning on the SO-HALA effect. The scalar relativistic HALA corrections (we will designate them here as the SF-HALA corrections) to the shielding constants of light atoms were negligible in most cases, especially when the heavy atom belongs to the 16th and 17th groups of the periodic table of elements (PTE) [31].",

Let us consider an electron with energy F E E < (where F E is Fermi energy), moving towards the border of the solid as a planar de Broglie wave.

One reflected from the top of the indent and another from the bottom of the indent. If the indentation depth\n4 / λ = a ,\nwhere λ is electron de Broglie wavelength, two reflected waves will interfere destructively resulting in no reflected wave. Consequently, an electron of certain energy cannot reflect back from the surface. On the other hand, the electron cannot leave solid to vacuum as it does not have enough energy to overcome the potential barrier ( F E E < ). It cannot reflect under arbitrary angle as it is in the Fermi gas in which all quantum states are already occupied. Therefore, all possible final quantum states for that particular electron are forbidden. As all the final states are forbidden, the initial state with wave vector a k 2 / π = is also forbidden. Obviously, all states with wave vector component\n) 2 / 1 ( ) / ( + = p a k Z π ,\nwhere p is integer are also forbidden. As a result, DOS near the interface is reduced with respect to the plain solid.\n\nQualitative description of DOS reduction is demanding. The calculation requires solving of the time-independent Schrödinger equation in the NG geometry. Mathematically, there is no difference between DOS reduction and the electromagnetic (TM) mode depression [7,8]. Helmholtz equation and Dirichlet boundary conditions are used in both cases. Unfortunately, there is no exact analytical solution for NG geometry. The approximate analytical expression known as Weyl's formula [9,10] allows calculation of DOS using a ratio of layer surface and volume. Perturbation method [11] has been used to find an approximate analytical expression for G in NG geometry.

As the case of the nuclear shell model demonstrated, it might be interesting to have a look at the answers that theoretical chemists give to predict the chemical properties of superheavy elements. Traditionally, the chemical properties of an unknown element and its compounds were predicted by exploiting the fundamental relationships of the physicochemical data of the elements and their compounds within the groups and the periods of the Periodic Table. However, with the increasing nuclear charges in heavy elements, the innermost electrons become more tightly bound and are thus moving with velocities which are a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore they obey the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics. Due to relativistic rearrangements, which are predicted for the electronic structure of the heaviest elements, quite unexpected chemical properties are to be expected. These so-called relativistic effects are already severely influencing the chemical properties of lighter elements such as gold. The yellow color and the rather inert chemical behavior can be attributed to relativistic effects and explained by fully relativistic quantum chemical calculations. [17] Early predictions of the chemical properties of superheavy elements were rather spectacular. One of the articles was entitled 'Are elements 112, 114, and 118 relatively inert gases?'. [18] Nowadays, with the use of powerful supercomputers the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations is increasing rapidly. Latest calculations come to the conclusion that element 112 (Cn) is not completely inert as expected for a noble gas, but should form a chemical bond with Au, which, however, is weaker than that of the lighter homolog Hg. [19] Also, element 114 might be relatively inert but should interact stronger with an Au surface than Cn. [19] Element 118 is predicted to be the first element in the row of noble gases with an electron affinity. [20] Due to the considerable experimental difficulties in experimentally studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements, the gap between experimental observables and theoretical predictions is still large.",

Electromagnetic radiation is emitted tangentially to the instantaneous path of the electrons, as predicted from theoretical calculations (Schwinger 1949), with wavelengths ranging from the infrared to the hard X-ray region. Relativistic effects confine the emission to a narrow cone in the forward direction with low angular divergence in the plane of the ring.

Relativistic and electron correlation effects\n\nIn the first paper about relativistic polarization propagators one of the main advantages of the formalism was shown, namely the possibility to get the value of relativistic effects by setting the speed of light c → ∞ in the model itself. 38 Another advantage is that relativistic effects can be analyzed separately on each of the terms appearing in eq. (10) with the same procedure. Then, by considering perturbators and principal propagator as separated objects, it is possible to obtain different information about the origin of the perturbation that takes place in the regions close to the coupled nuclei together with the efficiency of the transmission of those perturbations through the molecular electronic framework. In addition, this scheme facilitates the elucidation of what kind of relativistic effects (e.g. scalar or spin-dependent) mostly affect the matrix elements involved in eq. (10).\n\nAnother aspect polarization propagator theory makes possible is the account for electron correlation to different orders in the calculation of response properties. This gets clearer from eqs. (7) and (8). Keeping the diagonal matrix A(0) alone, and neglecting matrices A(1) and B(1) is equivalent to have a one-particle operator Hamiltonian H 0 , which is diagonal in the considered spin-orbital basis (i.e. H 0 describes a system of non-interacting particles). This is known as the pure zeroth-order approximation or PZOA. Matrices A(1) and B(1) arise when two-particle interactions are considered as part of H 0 and are, therefore, the resulting expressions consistent through first order in the electron interaction. Electron correlation, when viewed in this picture, thus, manifests itself in the occurrence of two-electron integrals in eqs. (7) and (8). This is a result of the propagator formalism and arises whether the set of spin-orbitals used in the construction of the reference state wave function, |0 , is obtained by solving the Hartree-Fock or the Kohn-Sham equations self-consistently.\n\n\nC.

[170][171][172][173] Ren and co-workers investigated the influence of light-driven Janus micromotor on photocatalytic property via TiO 2 -Au particles. [174] With light irradiation, photoexcited electrons migrated to Au side from TiO 2 , and holes were left on TiO 2 side. As a result, dye molecules were reduced by photoinduced electrons, leading to the lower dye concentration near Au side compared with that near TiO 2 side, as depicted in Figure 6a. The difference in dye concentration would cause the self-diffusiophoretic motion of dye molecules, which led to dye solution flow and promoted itself to move continuously during photocatalytic degradation reaction. Consequently, the photocatalytic degradation first-order rate constant was increased from 2.01 × 10 −2 to 2.98 × 10 −2 min -1 . [174] Similarly, Nelson and co-authors developed multiwavelength light-responsive Janus micromotors Au/B-TiO 2 in which a thin Au layer was asymmetrically deposited on the surface of black TiO 2 microsphere with the diameter of about 3.5 μm. [175] These constructed Janus micromotors could be self-propelled under a broad wavelength range of light illumination, including ultraviolet, blue, cyan, green and red light, both in H 2 O 2 solutions and pure H 2 O (Figure 6b). Results showed that the motion speed of micromotors decreased with the increases in wavelength and the highest speed (about 30 μm s -1 ) was achieved under entire visible light spectrum (>400 nm), corroborating the great application potentials of these constructed micromotors in photocatalysis with the utilization of full solar spectrum.

Imagine you are sitting on a beach watching two boats moving in opposite directions at equal speeds, s. To a passenger looking out of a porthole below deck on one boat it will appear as if the second boat is moving with a speed of 2s. This is known as 'Newtonian relativity' and the equations of motion are said to be 'Galilean invariant'. An inertial reference frame is any set of coordinates that is not accelerating. To transform coordinates between two inertial reference frames S and S' moving at a relative speed , we use the 'Galilean' transformation, which, if we define the x-axis to be parallel to direction of the relative motion, can be written as ,  ′  ,  ′  ,  ′  ,  and  ′  , where , , and are the Cartesian coordinates and is the x-component of velocity in frame S at time t; primed quantities are the equivalent quantities in frame S' at time t.

Unfortunately, such a closed-form solution is not known for the general many-electron case in an external field of atomic nuclei for two reasons.\n\n(i) Already for a single electron in the presence of an external electrostatic potential v E , no closed-form expression for a unitary transformation can be constructed [12].\n\n(ii) Vector potentials, such as those emerging from external magnetic fields or the magnetic interaction of two electrons, as well as contributions from exchange integrals (in Hartree-Fock-type theories) to the off-diagonal super-block of the Dirac Hamiltonian add additional complexity to the problem [13]. A solution was already suggested by Foldy and Wouthuysen [11]. A sequence of unitary transformations can be used to suppress the off-diagonal blocks order by order in terms of an expansion parameter. Strictly speaking, exact decoupling is then obtained only after an infinite number of such transformations.\n\nIn physics, expansions of relativistic Hamiltonians are usually carried out order by order with respect to the inverse speed of light 1/c, and so was the expansion of Foldy and Wouthuysen.

From the fitted images, the relevant polarization moments were extracted and then used to calculate the DCSs. The method is described in detail in our earlier work 50,51 (see in particular Section 4 in ref. 51).\n\nWe define the orientation in the two side-on configurations according to the electric field vector in the scattering frame. In the scattering frame, the initial relative velocity vector, k, is parallel to the z-axis and the +xz plane is defined by k and k 0 , the outgoing relative velocity vector (and the y-axis is chosen such that the frame is right-handed). If the electric field points along the +x-axis, the orientation is ''+x''; if the field points along the Àx-axis, the orientation is ''Àx''. The two side-on, as well as the two end-on geometries are depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Note that in the side-on configuration, the +x orientation corresponds to repulsive collisions off the N-side (a), and the Àx orientation to repulsive collisions off the O-side of the molecule (b). A closer look at Fig. 1(a) and (b) shows that each of the two side-on geometries actually contains both configurations; if k 0 was lying in the Àx hemisphere, the +x orientation in panel (a) would become Àx and vice versa for the Àx orientation in panel (b). Therefore, the azimuthal angle of k 0 (in the detector frame) has to be taken into account when analyzing the side-on data. In the end-on configuration, the distribution of k 0 around k is symmetric, and N-end/O-end collisions are defined as ''Àz'' and ''+z'', irrespective of the azimuthal angle of k 0 (Fig. 1(c) and (d)).",

For a recent review, the reader is referred to Ref. 12. For the bulk FCC antiferromagnet, the Heisenberg spins on a tetrahedron form a configuration characterized by two arbitrary angles. 13 The ground state (GS) degeneracy is therefore infinite. This is also found in fully frustrated simple cubic lattice with classical Heisenberg spins: 14 the GS is also characterized by two random continuous parameters. To give an idea about the GS of the bulk FCC antiferromagnet, 13 let us imagine two planes, xz and ψ, where ψ intersects with the xz plane along the z axis and makes an angle φ with the x axis. Two of the four spins make an angle θ in the xz plane symmetric with respect to the z axis. The other two spins make also the same angle, symmetric with respect to the z axis, but in the plane ψ. It has been shown 13 that the two angles θ and φ are arbitrary between 0 and π. Note that when θ = 0 the spin configuration is collinear with two spins along the +z axis and the other two along the −z one. The phase transition of the bulk frustrated FCC Heisenberg antiferromagnet has been studied. 15 In particular, the transition is found to be of the first order as in the Ising case. 16,17,18 Other similar frustrated antiferromagnets such as the HCP antiferromagnet show the same behavior. 19 Let us consider a film of FCC lattice structure with (001) surfaces. To avoid the absence of long-range order of isotropic non Ising spin model at finite temperature (T ) when the film thickness is very small, i.e. quasi two-dimensional system 20 , we add in the Hamiltonian an Ising-like uniaxial anisotropy term.

Vector S is directed along the nuclear spin. Nuclei with the octupole deformation have large intrinsic collective Schiff moment, proportional to the collective octupole moment [18,19]. All odd electric moments (including electric dipole, octupole and Schiff moments) vanish in the laboratory frame if parity is conserved. Indeed, EDM and Schiff moment are polar T -even vectors which must be directed along the nuclear spin I which is T -odd pseudovector. This vanishing happens due the nuclear rotation which makes average orientation of the nuclear axis zero, < k >= 0, and all odd moments correlated with this axis do not show up in the laboratory frame. However, time and parity violating nuclear forces mix nuclear rotational states of opposite parity (which form a doublet for non-zero nuclear spin I, similar to the Λ-doubling in molecules) and produce orientation of the nuclear axis k along the nuclear spin, < k >∝ I. This makes the electric dipole and Schiff moments directed along the nuclear spin in the laboratory frame, < S >∝ I [18,19]. For a spherical nucleus with one unpaired nucleon, both terms in Eq. (1) are comparable in absolute value but have opposite signs. Both of them often are not known accurately. This can lead to the large uncertainty of the Schiff moment for such a nucleus. The problem with the cancellation does not arise for the Schiff moment of a nucleus with octupole deformation since the second term in Eq. (1) is strongly suppressed. Indeed, if the shape of the proton and neutron distributions is the same, the intrinsic electric dipole moment relative to the centre of mass vanishes, e < r >= 0. Absence of the cancellation makes the result stable. A detailed description of the Schiff moment calculation can be found in Refs. [20,21] and references therein. A few equations explaining the origin and magnitude of the Schiff moment [18,19,21] are also given in the Appendix.",

Besides, the probability is symmetrical about Θ = π/2. When we come to the initial singlet state, there is no such dependence on the angle Θ. This is a reasonable result for isotropic hyperfine coupling case since both the singlet state and the transformed Hamiltonian do not explicitly depend on the angle.\n\nOn the other hand, the chemical reaction rate for triplet state would vanish once there were no interaction between the electron spins and their nuclear environments, i.e., g j = 0, while the ET reaction happens when the electron spins are in the singlet state.

For the spin-orbit scatterers an Anderson type model is taken with spin-orbit interaction on the d-level of the scatterer and an average was taken all over the sample. 29,30 The surprising 1/d dependence can be explained in the following way. One of the two spin-orbit scatterers in diagram Fig. 3 must experience of the finite size by missing the scatterers in the area indicated on the figure Fig. 4 as region I, while the other one can be very nearby the impurity (region II on Fig. 4). The number of the most effective missing scatterers can be estimated as proportional to d 3 , while of the second type as the number of scatterers in the neighborhood of the spin which is calculated to be between 100-1000. That large number appears as a prefactor. The transition concerning the angular momentum can be treated in a frame, where the z axis connects the certain scatterer and the impurity. The magnetic quantum number changes e.g. as m → m ± 1. The overlap of those localized d-states with the conduction electrons must be taken. The amplitude of the electron spherical wave function centered at the impurity on an atomic scale a (a ≪ d) nearby the axis is 1/r(a/r) |m| at distance r ∼ d ≫ a. r −1 comes from the radial amplitude of a spherical wave, while r −|m| from the angular dependence (Y lm ∼ (sin θ) |m| ). Namely, the scattering atom of size a is seen from the spin inside the angle θ ∼ a/r. Therefore the largest contribution is due to the states m = 0 and m = ±1. The overlap of the radial wave function with the atomic orbital of the scatterer is, however, oscillating, thus it contains an extra factor in the form\nn=0 (S m n sin k F r(k F r) −n + C m n cos k F r(k F r) −n ) (see Eq.s (13a-c) in Ref. 30 ),",

In the case of Cr we neglected the spin-density wave and considered the antiferromagnetic structure with two atoms in the unit cell and with the magnetic moments parallel and antiparallel to the z-axis.

To illustrate this we plot in Fig. 6(c) the angle α enclosed by the direction of the spin current and the direction of the spin polarization as well as the SHCs associated with Q and Q ⊥ (see Eq.

Note that in case of Ru we have the case of a colossal anisotropy of the SHE: the values of the two calculated conductivities differ by an order of magnitude. In the case of Cr the SHE is anisotropic as the cubic symmetry is broken by the staggered magnetization: If the spin polarization of the spin current is perpendicular to the staggered magnetization the SHC is larger by a factor of 1.8 compared to the case of spin polarization parallel to the staggered magnetization.

With the calculated average S eff = 1.263 a value of -49 K is derived for the paramagnetic Curie temperature that compares well with the experimental result of -64 K [11]. It remains the interpretation of the remarkable decrease of µ B with decreasing temperature. Analysing the magnetic orbitals of the symmetric structure reveals that for the broken-symmetry state the directions of the three 3/2 spins form angles of 120° between each pair resulting in a total spin of zero. Moreover, since the energetically most favourable pairwise antiferromagnetic coupling cannot be realized (\"spin frustration\"), the system will distort geometrically in such way that this spin frustration will be reduced. Accordingly, in the distorted RT geometry the angle between the spins belonging to the two Cr-ions with the slightly enlarged distance is reduced. At temperatures below T N the distortion is expected to be considerably more pronounced and might lead to a further reduction of this angle although other distortions cannot be excluded, of course. From the calculated S eff = 1.217 at the Cr-ion opposite to the elongated side and S eff = 1.286 at the other two (symmetry equivalent) ions a reduction of the angle to approximately 90° yields a total effective spin of about 0.6 and, thus, an effective magnetic moment of 1.96 µ B , close to the measured value of 1.88 µ B . Classically this result can be interpreted in such a way that the geometrical distortion is accompanied by a rotation of the spin vectors. Quantum-mechanically, this corresponds to the transitions between the sublevels M S of a spin multiplet. The energies of such transitions are usually in the meV range and are, thus, consistent with the temperature range where they occur in (CrCl 3 ) 3 .

If the enlargement of a system is accompanied by the increase of the degrees of freedom needed to describe the system, different vector spaces must be combined to a larger vector space, called a tensor product of vector spaces 54 , which is again a vector space. The individual vector spaces can be identical or completely different. For example, wave functions in one variable, e.g., ψ(x), allow to describe the motion of a quantum object along the x-axis, they are elements of a Hilbert space H(x). To describe the motion in a plane, the new degree of freedom, motion along the y-axis, must be accounted for by elements of the Hilbert space H(y). The Hilbert space describing the motion in the xy-plane is the tensor product H(xy) = H(x) ⊗ H(y). For a free quantum object, both factor spaces are isomorphic. To describe motion in physical space, a third degree of freedom has to be added and the Hilbert space is H(r) = H(x) ⊗ H(y) ⊗ H(z). If the quantum object has a spin, another (internal) degree of freedom must be considered; the corresponding spin operator acts on spin states, which are elements of a spin Hilbert space H(s). The Hilbert space of a free quantum object with spin is then the tensor product H(r) ⊗ H(s).\n\n\nDefinition",

We proposed the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) antisymmetric exchange interaction D.( S i × S j ) with D the DM vector, always allowed in the absence of an inversion center between spins S i and S j . It suffices to consider the DM interaction inside the trimer with the same DM vector along the c axis for the three bonds. This favors planar spin components, and its sign selects a triangular chirality and hence a helicity. This picture has been validated by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements 65 . The ESR measurements also prove that another component of the DM interaction is present which corresponds to the DM vector perpendicular to the trimer bonds and lying in the ( a, b) plane. It is expected to give rise to the small out-of-plane component suggested by the magnetization measurements. The conservation of the triangular chirality +1 for both structural chiralities is consistent with the P-even symmetry of the DM axial vector.\n\n\nB. Dynamical chirality\n\nThe remarkable ground state of the non-centrosymmetric Ba 3 NbFe 3 Si 2 O 14 langasite exhibiting a pure chiral state combining two types of magnetic chiralities, urged us to study its dynamical properties. We were in particular interested in investigating the consequence of this chiral ground state on the magnetic excitations. We thus conducted experiments on the triple-axis spectrometer IN20 at the ILL in its polarized neutron setup, with polarizing Heusler crystals as monochromator and analyzer. We used the CRYOPAD device, to obtain strict zero-field environment at the sample position, and to prepare incoming and outgoing neutron polarization independently. We mainly used longitudinal polarization analysis in order to measure the dynamical chiral scattering cross-section M ch in addition to the dynamical magnetic cross-section σ y M + σ z M (see section III B). The crystal, with a negative structural chirality, was aligned with ( b * , c * ) as a scattering plane, a being vertical. To get first a global overview of the spin waves, an experiment using unpolarized neutrons was also performed on the time-of-flight spectrometer IN5 at the ILL on the same single crystal at successive rotating angles around the vertical axis a 50 .",

Furthermore, the effect of the electron correlations is incorporated into the form by the introduction of a factor, K, called the Korringa ratio which measures the degree of spin fluctuations quantitatively, 30 i.e., Among the consequences is the possible quantum phase transition of charge order with respect to the strength of electron correlations. 44,45 In the metallic side in the phase diagram, the system is predicted to exhibit a crossover from a Fermi liquid to an incoherent bad metal with quantum critical charge fluctuations at a finite temperature T * , which depends on the distance from the quantum critical point in the phase diagram. In the incoherent state above T * , the spin lifetime is expected to be shortened without preferential scattering vector. The turnabout behavior in 1/T 1 T around 200K can be a signature of this crossover. Assuming that the largest transfer integral, t a , is t a ∼ 80meV in θ-I 3 as deduced from the analysis of optical data, 16 T * ∼ 200K corresponds to a reduced temperature of T * /t a ∼ 0.2, which is in a reasonable range in the prediction. 44 A related feature is seen in the optical conductivity measurements by Takenaka et al. 46 who observed a rapid loss of electronic coherence with increasing temperature. These experimental and theoretical results suggest that θ-I 3 is situated not so far away from the charge-ordering point. In case that spin fluctuations develop toward an antiferromagnetic ordering, the Korringa ratio K should be temperature sensitive, reflecting the preferential development of antiferromagnetic fluctuations with a well-defined wave vector Q relative to the Q = 0 (ferromagnetic) fluctuation. If the charge sector is also fluctuating, however, spin fluctuations should be spread in Q and may be only moderately reflected in K.",

In Mn-based DMS systems, the conduction electrons that contribute to the electric currents, interact with the 3d 5 electrons of the Mn ions with spin S = 5 2 via the sp-d exchange interaction.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14].

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq.

We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq.

It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions.

In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

Insofar as the inclusion of all effects like in experimental conditions is challenging for ab initio calculations because of the difficulties in building chemically relevant models and the fast growing of the computational costs as the model expands, the present quantum chemical study was performed on models with increasing chemical complexity, to approach the solution sample.\n\nThe spin-free optimized ground and the first excited state distances between uranium and the coordinated atoms of the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2together with experimental data are shown in Table I.\n\nIn the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2gas-phase PBE0 calculations, the ground state R U−O =1.758 Å value is in a good agreement with 1.766 Å obtained with the CCSD(T) wave-function method, while R U−Cl =2.714 Å comes out shorter than 2.735 Å. Moreover, the PBE0 geometries are in good accordance with the all-electron CAM-B3LYP results reported by Tecmer et al. [35]. This gives us confidence in the ability of PBE0 to provide fairly accurate geometries of the uranium containing complexes. The inclusion of solvent effects on [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2does not significantly change the R U−O distance as compared to the gas-phase calculations, but it shortens R U−Cl as the solvent polarity increases. Keeping in mind that we do not have strictly the same conditions as in the experiment, it is worth examining trends in both theoretical and experimental data. The comparison of the experimental crystal structure of Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 [6] with the structure of uranyl tetrachloride dianion in acetonitrile [49] shows that the R U−O bond length is almost the same in both conditions, while R U−Cl values are found to be longer in solution by about 0.01 Å.",

When such transition occurs \nthe U-O bond weakens and the excited state potential \ncurve shifts along the U-O symmetric stretching mode \nto larger distances and becomes flatter [19]. Looking at \nthe excited state geometries of the uranyl tetrahalide di-\nanions one can note a lengthening of the R U−O bond \nby 0.031 Å and 0.028 Å, in [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2 -and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2 -, \nrespectively, since the excitation depopulates the U-O \nbonding σ u orbital. The differences of the R U−X bonds \nare small, about 0.010 Å in average, because the σ u or-\nbital has small contributions from the halide valence p or-\nbitals. From highly resolved low-temperature two-photon \nabsorption spectra of Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 , Denning et al.

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane. The resulting ν s value amounts to (836 ± 18) cm −1 . It is in good agreement with the values, (823 ± 14) cm −1 , 825 cm −1 , and (850 ± 25) cm −1 observed in acetone [7], [C 4 mim][Tf 2 N] [8], and in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] [9], respectively. This vibration corresponds to a Raman active vibration of the uranyl unit and can be correlated to the yl-U -O bond length. Using the empiric relation of Bartlett and Cooney [47]:\nR U−O /(Å) = 106.5 × ν −2/3 s + 0.575(1)\nwe calculated the U -O bond length to be equal to (1.77 ± 0.01) Å (using ν s = (836 ± 18) cm −1 ) for our uranyl sample. This value is in a good agreement with all experimental data listed in Table I, and can therefore serve as reference data to assess the accuracy of the ab initio calculations we will now discuss.",

With increasing of polarity the ν U−Cl stretching frequencies insignificantly increase (4 and 7 cm −1 ) for the ground and excited states, respectively, while the uranyl ν b , ν s and ν a decrease by 5 up to 25 cm −1 in both states. This shift of the ground-state frequencies should be observable in the computed luminescence spectra, namely in the spacing between the vi- brationally resolved peaks, while the minor change of the excited state frequencies should only affect the vibronic intensities. The substitution of chlorides by bromides in the uranyl equatorial plane lead to the following changes in the vibrational spectra. Compared to uranyl tetrachloride, the ν b value decreased by less than 10 cm −1 in both ground and excited states. The ν s increased by 13 and 62 cm −1 in the ground and excited states, respectively. Similarly, the ν a increased by 14 cm −1 for the ground and 76 cm −1 for the first excited state. The U -Br stretching mode is 83 cm −1 lower in both ground and excited states than the U -Cl symmetric stretching vibration. This is in line with the ground-state experimental trends measured for\nCs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 with [C 7 H 16 NO 2 ][UO 2\nBr 4 ] (91, 2, 6 and 9 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively). These changes indicate that the bromide ligand has a smaller effect on the electronic structure of uranium than chloride, since the U-Br bond strength is essentially ionic and has less impact on the U-O bonding. Consistently, the uranium -oxygen symmetrical stretching frequency is higher than in the chloride complex and close to the bare uranyl value. For [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2we estimate a shift of frequencies between the ground and excited state equal to 6, 2, 31 and 53 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

Theoretical luminescence spectra\n\nTo simplify the comparison within all spectra, let them be obtained from our quantum chemical calculations or from experiment, they are all normalized so that the first peak matches the experimental amplitude. Neither homogeneous and heterogeneous line broadening effects are included because of their complicated prediction [2]. We will thus only discuss the stick spectra.\n\nThe most relevant parameters influencing the spectral intensity distribution are the vibrational wavefunctions of both initial and excited states. The spectral shape is significantly linked to the bond-length changes between the two electronic states, as identified by Su et al. [4] thanks to a semi-classical vibronic approach. Especially, they concluded that the computed bond-length of the excited state is estimated without a sufficient accuracy to properly simulate the intensities. In our study, the theoretical luminescence spectra of [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2in gas phase are displayed on Figure 9. In all uraniumbased compounds at room temperature (300 K), luminescence arises from a low oscillator strength electron transition followed by the vibrational progression in the ν s mode of the electronic ground state, as the ν s is totally symmetric and preserves the symmetry of the vibronic (electronic+vibrational) wave function. The first observed band corresponds to the 0-0 vibrational transition. In the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2 -, the totally symmetric ν U−Cl mode is also excited vibronically, contributing to a line in the vibronic progression which is distant from the 0-0 line by 235 cm −1 . However, as we already commented upon the fact that the U-X lengthening from the ground and excited states is underestimated by our quantum approach, we cannot expect the computed relative intensities to match the experimental ones. Still, our predicted spectra place the peaks distribution and band spacing in great agreement with the experimental results. The complete assignment of the observed peaks is provided in ESI.",

Both the π 2 * and π 3 * shape resonances, which are well-known from electron transmission spectroscopy of isolated U, have been observed in the water clusters. A significant fraction of these resonances decay to form the ground state anion in all clusters studied (up to n = 10). Extrapolation with increasing U − (H 2 O) n cluster size of the resonances, adiabatic detachment, and vertical detachment energies, offers a picture of the energetics and available resonances in a bulk aqueous environment. We find that AEA (aq) = 3.53 ± 0.20 eV and VDE (aq) = 4.75 ± 0.20 eV and that the reorganization energy, λ ∼ 1.2 eV. The broad π 2 * resonance in isolated uracil is a bound state in the anion geometry, but the high-energy edge remains a resonance in the neutral geometry. As a result, the π 2 * resonance can capture electrons with vertical attachment energies, VAE ≲ 0.4 eV, and rapid adiabatic hydration dynamics drives the electron binding. The π 3 * resonance with VAE (aq) ∼ 1.6 eV remains unbound along a larger fraction of the reorganization coordinate, but eventually does become bound by 0.85 eV in the anion geometry. Recovery of the ground electronic state of the uracil anion is observed in all studied hydrated clusters, suggesting that even when the π 3 * is a resonance, internal conversion can compete to form a stable uracil anion. Hence, both the π 2 * and π 3 * resonances can capture electrons in the bulk aqueous environment leading to the radical uracil anion in its ground electronic state.",

Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O.

BASIC CONCEPTS\n\nThis section briefly reviews some of the basic concepts of charge migration and charge transfer. Since charge transfer on the time scale of nuclear motion and above has been extensively discussed in the literature (see, e.g., Ref. 1), here, we focus on charge migration on electronic time scales (see, e.g., Refs. 7-9 and 27-39). Starting from the simplest case of a superposition of electronic states with fixed nuclei, we discuss charge migration and the conditions under which it can take place. We subsequently introduce the role of nuclear motion and discuss how it may affect charge migration. Finally, the relation between charge migration and charge transfer is briefly discussed.\n\n\nA. Electronic superposition states\n\nThe simplest situation supporting the spatial displacement of electronic charge corresponds to a coherent superposition of two electronic states, e.g., the lowest-lying 2 R þ g and 2 R þ u states of H þ 2 . This situation is illustrated in Fig. 1. Denoting the electronic wavefunction of these two states / g and / u , and assuming the nuclear positions to be fixed at the equilibrium geometry of the electronic ground state, the total electronic wavefunction of the coherent superposition state is then expressed as\nw ¼ / g þ / u exp ÀiDEt= h ð Þ ;(1)\nwhere DE is the energy separation of the two states, which amounts to 11.83967 eV at the equilibrium geometry of the electronic ground state. 40 The time-dependent electron density is given by\njwj 2 ¼ j/ g j 2 þ j/ u j 2 þ 2/ g / u cos DEt= h ð Þ;(2)\nwhich migrates from one hydrogen atom to the other with a period of 348 as. Coherent superposition states will thus, in general, display time-dependent electronic densities, i.e., charge migration. One prerequisite, however, is the existence of spatial overlap FIG. 1.

CAVITY QED COUPLED CLUSTER (QED-CC) Beyond the single-particle theories discussed in the previous sections, a number of groups have considered many-body frameworks for ab initio cavity QED calculations. Many of these efforts have focused on the coupled-cluster (CC) 78-81 ansatz, which has enjoyed great success in conventional (non-QED) quantum chemistry applications. CC methods exhibit a number of desirable features that have contributed to this success, including the size-extensivity of truncated CC expansions, the size-intensivity of equation of motion (EOM) 81-84 or linear-response 85-92 CC excitation energies, and systematic convergence of the approach toward the full CI limit. Two slightly different generalizations of CC theory for use with the PF Hamiltonian appeared in the literature at roughly the same time. 57,93 The polaritonic coupled-cluster theory of Mordovina, Bungey, Appel, Knowles, Rubio, and Manby 93 considered an exponential parametrization of the ground-state polaritonic wave function that included single and double electronic transition operators, as well as photon creation operators and coupled electron transition and photon creation operators.

Some of the ground-state vibrational frequencies are responsible for the band spacing in the experimental luminescence spectrum, while the atomic displacement between the ground and excited-state geometries is responsible for the intensities ratio. The uranium -halide (ν U−X ), uranium -oxygen(ν s ) symmetrical stretching modes and uranium -oxygen bending mode (ν b ) contribute to the luminescence spectra shape to a large extent, and their values for the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2complexes are listed in Table II. The uranium -oxygen asymmetrical stretching mode (ν a ), which is vibronically silent, is also shown to discuss trends. Using the vibrational perturbation theory [52,53] as implemented in Gaussian 16 [25], we have computed the anharmonic corrections, which turned out to be small, of the order of 5 and 3 cm −1 for the ground and excited states respectively (See Table S2 in the ESI).\n\nFor the gas-phase [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2model, the computed ν U−Cl , ν b , ν s and ν a frequencies are smaller in the excited state than in the ground state by 4, 4, 80 and 115 cm −1 , respectively.

From the previous studies it is known that for uranyl dication coordinated by ligands the lowest excited state arises from the σ u highest molecular orbital (HOMO) to the δ u lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO). The HOMO corresponds to the bonding combination of uranium 5f and 6p and oxygen 2p atomic orbitals, and 3p orbital of first-shell ligands, while the LUMO is a nonbonding uranium 5f orbital ( Figure 8). The detailed analysis of the atomic orbitals contributions performed with multi-reference CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent field) calculations by Pierloot and van Beisen [20] suggests that the lowestlying excitation corresponds to a metal-centered transition from the bonding to nonbonding orbital of uranium, with a marginal ligand-to-metal charge transfer character. Hence, we can use in our discussion the UO 2 2+ spinfree notations (D ∞h ), thus labelling the ground state as 1 Σ + g and the luminescent state as 3 ∆ g . The vertical absorption E VA and emission E VE energies, were obtained at all-electron SOC CAM-B3LYP level of theory and are reported here together with experimental values (Table IV). They were computed with the summation of the fully relativistic electronic vertical energies associated with the spin-free zero-point energies correction. It should be noted that the experimental data correspond to the band-origin values obtained from polarized absorption or luminescence spectra and emission energies taken from UV-Visible spectroscopic measurements. Thus the direct comparison with theoretical re- sults is not relevant, but we rather discuss whether the theoretical data reproduce the experimental trends. As seen in Table IV, the vertical absorption energy of [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2increases by 85 cm −1 with the addition of acetone due to its small polarity. A blue shift of 117 cm −1 is observed when chlorides are replaced by bromides ligands. On the contrary, the band origins seem red shifted by 128 cm −1 , from chloride to bromide complexes according to experimental data",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

It is imperative, given the two polymorphs of Ce2O3, that any theoretical framework chosen to describe the energetics (or electronic structure), is able to identify the right ground state. Figure 4a consequently plots the energy difference between the hexagonal and cubic polymorphs of Ce2O3 across different U values within the SCAN+U framework. DFT-SCAN (U = 0) wrongly predicts cubic-Ce2O3 to be the ground state (by ~0.15 eV/f.u. versus hexagonal-Ce2O3), while increasing U values gradually increases the stability of hexagonal-Ce2O3. At U = 2 eV, the hexagonal polymorph is predicted to be the ground state (by ~1 meV/f.u.), with the stability of the hexagonal structure increasing up to ~15 meV/f.u. at U = 6 eV. Given that U = 1.8 eV minimizes the error between SCAN+U calculations and experimental oxidation enthalpy for Ce2O3 → CeO2, and that a minimum of U = 2 eV is required to identify the right hexagonal ground state at Ce2O3, we define the optimal U for Ce (UCe) to be 2 eV.

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn.

Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

When the CO bond was stretched to 4 a 0 , the system was strongly multireference, and all the errors were noticeably larger than that for the equilibrium geometry. To make the truncated CI errors in the stretched geometry similar to CISD in the equilibrium geometry, we had to go to CI(4) for the energies but CI(5) for the 2-RDM. MCCI could achieve a 2-RDM accuracy similar to CI(6) but using fewer determinants than CI(4). When increasing the size of the basis set to cc-pVDZ for the equilibrium geometry, we found that, although MCCI had much higher accuracy than CISDT, it could not reach that of CI(4) due to the larger FCI space. CI(4) used around 2.8 million determinants, and the multireference character is not strong here. For this singlet system, we also considered the use of CSFs for the 2-RDM calculation and found that the main benefit seemed to be a reduced size of the wavefunction in the CSF representation as the spin contamination for MCCI with SDs was not large. Finally, we looked at CSFs when constructing the 2-RDM for the M s = 1 triplet state of oxygen. Now, the reduction in the size of the wavefunction when using CSFs was not observed, unlike for the CO singlet. However, again, the spin contamination was very low when SDs were used.  Figure 11.

We correlate only the valence electrons and use state-average natural orbitals obtained with a preliminary calculation at the CIPSI level. For each state, we compute the energy with only one CSF, and on top of this configuration, we perform a CAS-CI calculation restricted to the σ and the π orbitals in a CAS-σ and CAS-π, respectively. The reference FCI excitation energy in this basis and the associated confidence interval are computed following the scheme presented in ref 38 rather than extrapolating the variational energies of the individual states in the limit of the PT2 energy correction going to zero. Indeed, the uncertainties of the extrapolated FCI energies of both states are larger than the uncertainty on the estimated excitation energy computed with this scheme. Since the CC3 estimate for CN3 and CN5 is in excellent agreement with the FCI value, we use the CC3 excitation energy as reference for CN7. We note that, because of the use of the simple 6-31G basis set, the FCI and CC3 excitation energies are much higher than the more accurate results presented above, but this is not relevant for the present discussion.\n\nFor the CN3 molecule, the excitation energy obtained with a single CSF for each state is 8.91 eV, namely, higher by 1.4 eV than the FCI result.

Similarly, the excitation energy obtained with the CAS-σ improves the excitation energy with respect to the single CSF by recovering about 31% of the error. These results indicate the importance of both σ and π orbitals in the calculation of the excitation energy of CN3.",

We found that, for these molecules, MCCI with a cutoff of 1 × 10 −3 gave around an order of magnitude improvement on Hartree−Fock, and for ammonia and methane, this was enhanced by around another order of magnitude on lowering the cutoff to 2 × 10 −4 while only a very small fraction of the FCI space was used.\n\nThis proof of concept for analytic selected CI gradients was demonstrated to work well using Monte Carlo configuration interaction with Slater determinants.

However, a more discerning comparison of atomic charges Q IMB X and Q g X reveals that the latter ones are usually closer to the corresponding exact IMB-charges (calculated within set of functions g). On the other hand, atomic charges Q d X deviate significantly from the exact charges only in the case of more accurate calculations (if we exclude BH 3 molecule and take into consideration only basis set of TZV-type the average difference between the most exact values of Q d X and Q IMB mathrm X assumes 0.0043e, e.i. about 0.6 %). Indeed, convergence profiles that emerge from values of¯ X allow one to draw the conclusion that the more accurate are canonical FAOs used to construct a set of IMB-orbitals the closer to the exact values (in a sense of basis-set completeness) are the resulting IMB-charges calculated within any arbitrary basis set.\n\n\nSummary\n\nIn this work we have introduced and briefly examined a simple method of generating a minimal set of molecule-adopted atomic orbitals. Contrary to the previously proposed method involving a reference set of (external) minimal-basis orbitals (e.g. Huzinaga's MINI basis set) [7], in this approach we have used the criterion of maximum overlap to the set of free-atom orbitals obtained from ab initio calculations (using the same set of basis functions) for the corresponding system promolecule. Hence, the resulting minimal-basis orbitals are intrinsic for individual molecules and consequently exhibit appropriate convergence properties as the number of basis functions used in calculations increases.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated that the MOC-scheme can be successfully utilized to approximate canonical free-atom orbitals within any arbitrary basis set using oneoff calculated FAOs of high quality (by default stored on disk); therefore, generating of IMB-orbitals does not require every-time calculations of promolecular systems. Moreover, partial atomic charges calculated within representation of such moleculeadapted atomic orbitals tend to converge noticeably faster to their exact values in the limit of complete basis set.",

We use the 6-31G basis set and two frozen orbitals. The FCI wavefunction contains 6,248,880 SDs in this case.\n\nIn Figure 11, we compare the errors when using SDs with CSFs for the MCCI calculation with cutoffs from 10 −2 to 10 −4 .\n\nThe multireference character for the MCCI SD wavefunction at the lowest cutoff considered was not strong at ς MR = 0.178. For this system and basis, we see that CSFs give a similar error that is perhaps slightly larger for a similar number of configurations than that for SDs. This is interesting given that expanding the CSFs to SDs increases the number of configurations by around four or five times here.\n\nThe good performance of SDs for the energy might be expected to come at the cost of a large deviation from pure spin states. However, Table 3 reveals that the spin contamination is small for SDs here and decreases with the number of configurations. Therefore, in terms of SDs, the wavefunctions are much more compact than that in the CSF calculation with only a small amount of spin contamination as a penalty. The difference from pure spin is slightly less than that for CO (Table 2) for a given cutoff, but the order of magnitude is similar.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have demonstrated that 2-RDMs can be efficiently calculated to sufficient accuracy by using the compact wavefunctions of the selected configuration interaction approach of MCCI and by exploiting the structure of the wavefunction together with bitwise operations on modern CPUs. For this latter approach, we demonstrated that the calculation of the 2-RDM from a FCI wavefunction can be accelerated around 220 times, while a speed up of about 26 was shown for a MCCI wavefunction. This enabled us to investigate the accuracy of the 2-RDM when using truncated CI and MCCI for a set of systems that ranged from having almost no multireference character to being very strongly multireference. The general behavior of the errors for the 2-RDM compared with those for the energy or wavefunction was fairly similar.",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state.

Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies.

That means, with decreasing interatomic distance Φ HL acquires ionic character and Φ ion acquires neutral character. If orthogonal AOs 1s A and 1s B are used, the CSFs Φ o HL and Φ o ion are also orthogonal to each other for all interatomic distances, and the electronic character of the wave functions never changes: Φ o HL is always neutral and Φ o ion is always ionic. Consequently, Φ o HL alone cannot describe a bonded molecule because the ionic contribution is completely missing. A correct description of the ground state needs always a linear combination of Φ o HL and Φ o ion . This was shown by McWeeny 31 and discussed by Pilar. 32 Mathematically, the situation is clear: the description of the electronic ground state of H 2 needs CI wave functions, either a linear combination of MO CSFs, or a linear combination of VB CSFs made with either orthogonal or non-orthogonal AOs. The three sets of CSFs are different bases for the same two-dimensional state space, two bases are orthogonal and the third one is non-orthogonal. The advantage of the orthogonal VB basis is that the squared CI coefficients have indeed the properties of probabilities and allow to measure the ionic character of the state; when non-orthogonal AOs are used, weights of the VB CSFs can only approximately calculated, for example with the Chirgwin-Coulson formula. 33Use of orthogonal AOs in VB calculations is not a trivial task, after all, the orthogonality of two basis functions or AOs depends on the molecular geometry. Atomic basis functions or AOs located at the position of atoms in a molecule are in general not orthogonal, but they can be orthogonalized with, e.g., Löwdin's symmetric orthogonalization method, and then used in a VB calculation. Alternatively, one can calculate the electronic state of a molecule with a conventional CI wave function using MO CSFs and then localize the MOs by an orthogonal transformation. I developed a method where delocalized MOs obtained with CASSCF are localized at predefined fragments with the help of an orthogonal transformation giving orthogonal fragment MOs (FMO). The advantage of this procedure is that the orthogonal transformation in the MO space causes an orthogonal transformation in the CSF space leaving the CASSCF wave function invariant. Most",

However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn.

Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first TDDFT study on the excited state of Gaq 3 . It can be seen that the emission peak of Gaq 3 is at longer wavelength than that of Alq 3 both theoretically and experimentally. For Alq 3 , the predicted emission energy is ca. 2.34 eV, corresponding to ca. 529 nm, which is in close agreement with the experimental value of 2.38 eV (520 nm). Also shown in Table 1 are emission wavelengths calculated using TD-B3LYP/ 6-31G(d) and data obtained by other groups, which were calculated at the TD-B3LYP level of theory using a spherical 6-31G basis set and optimized geometries obtained using the CIS method. The difference between the calculated data obtained previously and the experimental value is larger than that between our experimental and theoretical results, which indicates that the geometries of the excited states obtained using the CIS method are not as accurate as those calculated by TDDFT [15]. Moreover, the LANL2DZ basis set is more suitable for the calculation of the excited state of Alq 3 than the 6-31G (d) basis set.

The atomic basis set chosen is Stevens, Basch, Krauss, Jasien, Cundari effective core potentials (SBKJC ECPs) [54] for Mn, Pople's 6-31G for (X, O, and C), and 6-31++G for (N, H). The diffused functions included in the 6-31++G basis set are definitely necessary to describe the electron-accepting dynamics, particularly for the Rydberg-like states on the nitrogen atoms [18,19]. We limited our CISD active space to HOMO-(HOMO+80) to obtain the CSFs, the number of which amounts to 3321. With preliminary numerical studies prior to the extensive and costly production, we sought for the size of the active space and the number of configurations small enough to be manageable and large enough to give stable results, with respect to the change of the computational size.

The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq.

We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq.

The minimal basis set STO-3G consists of 1 function for H, 5 functions for Li to F and 9 functions for Na to Cl; the basis set 6-31G(d) consists of 2 functions for H, 15 for Li to F and 19 function for Na to Cl. So for most organic molecules, STO-3G only contains less than half of 6-31G(d) basis functions. Then with the STO-3G basis set much time can be saved during DFT calculations.   By analyzing the molecular descriptors, we find that, in the B3LYP/6-31G results, the charge on the N atom of NO does not change with the charge on Y. The electronegativity of Y itself is most likely the key factor determining the amount of charge on N because the charge on the N atom only changes with the type of Y atoms. Neither the structure of molecular fragments that connect to Y nor the amount of charges on Y has much effect on the charge value of N.  Table  2  Structural analysis indicates that the conformation of the molecules and functional groups on the aromatic rings are shown to affect the homolysis BDE. Conformational effects reported by the Guo group show that syn and anti conformations induce BDE differences between isomers [45].

Electron-donating groups at the ortho-position decrease the BDE of the Y-NO bond, but the effects of electron-withdrawing groups are stronger than electron-donating groups.

In Sec. 4 we show results of calculations of the chemical separation caused by the magnetic field. In Sec. 5 we comment on the magnetic field amplitude. In Sec. 6 we comment on a possible generation of a magnetic field gradient during the gravitational collapse. In Sec. 7 we identify a parameter region required for a successful chemical separation.

We assumed that the PMF has a gradient in a direction perpendicular to the field direction. This gradient is realized by an electric current density in the direction perpendicular to both directions of the field lines and the gradient. The Lorentz force on the charged species then causes a velocity difference between charged and neutral species in the direction of the field gradient. Resultantly, a velocity of charged species can be different from that of neutral species which collapses gravitationally during the structure formation. Therefore, 7 Li + ions may have possibly escaped from gravitational collapse of early structures. Calculations for fluid motions of charged and neutral species were performed through a simple estimation using fundamental fluid and electromagnetic equations. We assumed a gravitational contraction of neutral matter in a spherically symmetric structure. In addition, we utilized a cylindrical coordinate, and assumed a gradient of the altitudinal (z-component) magnetic field in the radial direction. Related physical quantities are listed, and their typical values are given in Sec. 3. Some analytical equations are introduced in Appendix A.\n\nWhen the amplitude of magnetic field is sufficiently large, the charged fluid significantly decouples from the neutral fluid. It is then possible that during the gravitational contraction of structure mainly composed of neutral hydrogens, contractions of protons, electrons, and 7 Li + ions do not occur. Although fluid motions of charged chemical species are solved for only H + , e, and 7 Li + in this study, other charged species are expected to have similar motions. Because of large inductances of large astronomical structures, the generation of magnetic field is never efficient during the structure formation at z ∼ 10. Therefore, only PMFs which existed from the start of the structure formation can trigger the chemical separation.\n\nThe chemical separation requires the magnetic field gradient in a direction perpendicular to the field direction. Although such a gradient was assumed in the initial condition in this study, it may be produced associated with a density gradient during the gravitational contraction of structures without any initial field gradient.",

The first cycle is a hydrogen (H), and the radius is set to 1. In the second cycle, there are four elements: helium(He), lithium(Li), beryllium(Be) and boron(B) with the number of protons of 2-5. The radius is set to 2. Each element occupies 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4 of the circle. Boron fills a sphere with radius of 2.

A gradient in the PMF in a direction perpendicular to the field direction leads to the Lorentz force on the charged species. Resultantly, an ambipolar diffusion occurs, and charged species can move differently from neutral species, which collapses gravitationally during the structure formation. We assume a gravitational contraction of neutral matter in a spherically symmetric structure, and calculate fluid motions of charged and neutral species. It is shown that the charged fluid, i.e., proton, electron and 7 Li + , can significantly decouple from the neutral fluid depending on the field amplitude. The charged species can, therefore, escape from the gravitational collapse. We take the structure mass, the epoch of the gravitational collapse, and the comoving Lorenz force as parameters. We then identify a parameter region for an effective chemical separation. This type of chemical separation can reduce the abundance ratio of Li/H in early structures because of inefficient contraction of 7 Li + ion. Therefore, it may explain Li abundances of Galactic metal-poor stars which are smaller than the prediction in standard big bang nucleosynthesis model. Amplitudes of the PMFs are controlled by a magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence. The upper limit on the field amplitude derived from the turbulence effect is close to the value required for the chemical separation.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

Moreover, the effect of volume ratio on the separation time and its efficiency was determined. The purity of biodiesel and the remaining soap content were analyzed.\n\n\nEffect of volume ratio\n\nEC was applied to shorten the complete sedimentation time or the separation time. Fig 5 shows that EC could reduce the separation time by 4-6 times depending on the volume ratio of biodiesel to glycerol. The separation efficiency profile with the use of EC was in similar trend as in GS. The fastest precipitation occurred at the 7:1 volume ratio of biodiesel to glycerol with crude glycerol absolutely separated at 30 s. Since EC separation process depends on the conductivity of particles, in this study are glycerol, catalyst and methanol by destabilization. The generated electrical field induces the ionic strength, charge neutralization, inter-droplet cross-link of these molecules [21]. Then, these particles are precipitated to the bottom. In this study, the separation efficiency at the volume ratio of biodiesel to glycerol 5:3 had been higher than 6:2 until 20 s because large amount of glycerol had moved to the electric field generated between electrodes and then coagulated [22]. In fact, not only electrocoagulation takes place in the system, but the gravity also forces molecules to settle to the bottom. Therefore, most of molecules had been settled with the influence of EC in the first 20 s. After that the gravitational force had interfered the performance of EC. Finally, the gravitational force took over the sedimentation phenomena. On the other hand, volume ratios of 4:4 and 3:5 behaved differently due to the viscosity of solution.

The imposed inhomogeneous electric field results in a partial polarization of the dipole population yielding a local change of dielectric permittivity thus further reinforcing field gradients 18,34,35 . This polarization gives rise to a displacement force which depending on the relative intensity of the applied field will generate a number of different liquid responses (see Figures 4-7) eventually resulting in the formation of a bridge. The liquid will also develop a Taylor flow 22,36 along the electrode surfaces especially in cases where there is a sharp edge present on the electrodes. The possibility of charge injection at sharp edges also exists and is consistent with the formation of heterocharge layers which generate electroconvective currents in the liquid bulk 22 thus linking the liquid bridge system with the Sumoto effect 12 . The governing EHD relationships for bridges are extensively covered elsewhere for water and other polar liquids 22,[36][37][38] . These theoretical approaches suffer certain limitations which should be considered when approaching experimental data. The Maxwell stress tensor treatment 36 is insensitive to field heterogeneities as well as non-uniformities in the liquid bridge. A pure EHD approach 37 provides steady state definitions of the electrogravitational number and its relationship to the bridge aspect ratio; however, the flow dynamics and important transient phenomena (e.g., bridge creation) are not predicted.

Such calculations result in electrostatic potentials, which are inherently a form of volumetric data -that is, the output is a set of numerical values of some dependent variable (our function), f , which varies with position in space, r, that is f ( r). The function f depends upon one or more independent variables by which we mean, for instance, position in 3-space, r ∈ ℜ 3 (or whatever region we take as our problem domain).\n\nThis function f may itself be vector-valued, such as electric field lines (or really any force field ). Or, the function may be scalar-valued, such as when the function under consideration is the electrostatic potential. For more background, recall from physics and vector calculus [5] that many important vector fields that arise in nature -the gravitational force field, the electric field (or electrostatic field if we consider only stationary charges [time-independent]), etc. -are described as conservative vector fields (or conservative functions/forces because they conserve energy, are path-independent, etc.)... and, in such cases these vector fields are expressible as the gradients of some type of function (think of it as the antiderivative), which is known in this context as a scalar potential, P. In a nutshell, the relationship is that the vector field function, F , is the negative gradient of the potential: F = −∇P. So, for example, (i) the electric(static) field is the negative gradient of the electric(static) potential ( E = −∇Φ, for electrical potential Φ( r) = U el ( r)/q)), (ii) the gravitational field experienced at some position r is the negative gradient of the gravitational potential at that position, and so on.",

Recent work has shown that primordial gas that is not collapsing gravitationally but is cooling from an initially ionized state forms hydrogen deuteride, HD, in sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. This extra cooling can reduce the characteristic mass for gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in the characteristic masses of population III stars. Motivated by the importance of the atomic and molecular data for the cosmological question, we assess several chemical and radiative processes that have hitherto been neglected: the sensitivity of the low temperature H 2 cooling rate to the ratio of ortho-H 2 to para-H 2 , the uncertainty in the low temperature cooling rate of H 2 excited by collisions with atomic hydrogen, the effects of cooling from H 2 excited by collisions with protons and electrons, and the large uncertainties in the rates of several of the reactions responsible for determining the H 2 fraction in the gas.It is shown that the most important of neglected processes is the excitation of H 2 by collisions with protons and electrons. This cools the gas more rapidly at early times, and so it forms less H 2 and HD at late times. This fact, as well as several of the chemical uncertainties presented here, significantly affects the thermal evolution of the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to clear differences in future detailed three dimensional studies of first structure formation. In such calculations it has previously been shown that the details of the timing between cooling and merger events decides between immediate runaway gravitational collapse and a slower collapse delayed by turbulent heating.Finally, we show that although the thermal evolution of the gas is in principle sensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in practice the standard assumption of a 3:1 ratio produces results that are almost indistinguishable from those produced by a more detailed treatment.Johnson & Bromm 2006;Johnson, Greif & Bromm 2007;Yoshida et al. 2007). Note, however, that even without HD cooling the characteristic masses of objects collapsing from gas within a relic primordial H ii region have already been demonstrated to be smaller(O'Shea et al. 2005).This difference in thermal evolution, depending on whether or not the gas was once ionized, is a consequence of the chemistry of HD formation and destruction.

Like electrostatic forces, the forces generated by hydrophobic mismatches also change in magnitude and even direction in response to DDW M , keeping the protein to reside inside the membrane bilayer. The relationship between the electrostatic force and hydrophobic mismatch can be analogous to the interaction between a floating boat and its surrounding water. Just as the gravitational force pulling the boat downwards is balanced by the buoyancy force that keeps the boat afloat, the C in state of a VS domain is maintained by the balance between forces of hydrophobic mismatch and the inward electrostatic forces exerted by DW M on each and every positively charged residue (as well as the outward electrostatic forces on negatively charged residues). Upon DW Mdepolarization, the inward (outward) electrostatic forces exerted on basic (acidic) residues are reduced; the mechanical balance of the C in state is broken; distinct mechanical torques are generated on different helices of the VS domain, promoting their relative movements. As a result, the overall conformation of the VS domain changes, and in the process a new state, C out , equilibrating between electrostatic and hydrophobic forces is established. Importantly, during the state transition, the tilting angle of S4 relative to the membrane normal is likely to change, a process that is accompanied by distinct patterns of charge exposure.

The cpH simulation method is, therefore, intrinsically semigrand canonical 30 . When performing a cpH simulation, a proton is implicitly brought into the system from an external reservoir at a fixed pH. To keep the charge neutrality inside the simulation cell one of the cations or protons inside the bulk of the cell is arbitrarily deleted. However, such an arbitrary deletion does not respect the detailed balance and leads to incorrect results, unless the system contains a lot of salt and is very dilute in polyelectrolyte 28,30 . Fortunately, it is easy to correct the standard cpH algorithm by combining a protonation move a) Electronic mail: levin@if.ufrgs.br with a simultaneous grand canonical insertion of an anion, and a deprotonation move with a simultaneous grand canonical deletion of an anion19,[28][29][30]36,37. This restores the detailed balance of the cpH algorithm making it internally consistent. This corrected version of the cpH algorithm will be used in the present Communication.In a real physical system, to confine polyelectrolyte or colloidal particles within some region of space requires a semi-permeable membrane, which would separate the system from the reservoir containing acid and salt. Since the counterions are at larger concentration inside the system than they are in the reservoir, they will tend to diffuse across the membrane 38 . The net ionic flux will end when a sufficiently large electrostatic potential difference is established between the reservoir and the system, forcing the reversal of the flow. This is known as the Donnan potential 39,40 . In fact one does not need to have a membrane to establish a finite Donnan potential. For example, a colloidal column in a gravitational field 41-43 will spontaneously establish a finite Donnan potential along the vertical direction. This happens because, in general, colloidal particles have a finite buoyant mass 44,45 , which forces them to be inhomgeneously distributed inside the suspension. On the other hand, the ions are not affected by the gravitational field and are free to diffuse throughout all space, including the top portion of suspension, where there are no colloidal particles. This results in Donnan potential along the vertical direction of colloidal suspension. In this case the gravitational field plays the role similar to",

A single charged colloidal sphere of buoyant mass m and charge q in a constant electric field not only experiences a downward gravitational force mg and an electrostatic force qE but also more complicated electrohydrodynamic and osmotic forces due to the electrolyte's response to the field. When the lower electrode is negative, the positive screening cloud of the sphere flows downward. These flowing ions, including OH − and H 3 O + created by hydrolysis, entrain a flow of water. The friction between this electrohydrodynamic flow and the sphere drags the sphere downward. The sphere's cloud of screening ions is deformed not only by the electric field, but also by the hydronium flux. This downward osmotic force and the downward electrohydrodynamic drag are second-order responses to the electric field, and therefore should be smaller than the electrostatic levitating force qE.\n\nStraightforward considerations allow us to estimate the bias needed to levitate a particle against gravity.

When pH < 4, the main electric group is protonated -NH 2 + . The repulsion force and increased hydrophilicity induces the increase of the swelling rate. While pH locates at a range of 4-9, a joint reaction from ion bondings between -NH 2 and -COOH, and hydrogen bond between -COOH and -OH promotes a dense structure, which leads to a reduced swelling capacity. The reason for the maximum swelling rate at pH = 9 may be expressed by the reaction cross linking of CMCTS chains via glutaraldehyde during the formation of the IPN network. The close structure between the chains was  profitable to the diastolic of KPAsp chains. Furthermore, according to the Donnan equilibrium theory, the swelling of the hydrogel is mainly determined by the penetrating pressure induced by the concentration difference of free ions in and outside the hydrogel. When pH < 4, the main electronic group in hydrogels is protonated -NH 2 + , while for pH > 9, the main electronic group is unprotonated -COO À . In the pH range of 4-9, the concentration of free ion inside the hydrogel is larger than that of the environment. Hence the swelling behavior of the hydrogel occurs to reduce the electron charges inside the hydrogel. When pH ranges from 5 to 8, the electric charges of -COO À and -NH 2 + in KPAsp/CMCTS are quite equal, hence the concentration difference of free ions is almost zero due to the nearly equal electrostatic attraction. The hydrogel was thus dehydrated and shrank adapting to the external penetrating pressure.    The effect of salt solutions on the swelling ratio of the prepared hydrogels with different structures is shown in Fig. 9(a-c), corresponding to the result of FeCl 3 , CaCl 2 and NaCl solution, respectively.

Reynolds numbers (Re) were determined using the hydraulic radius as the representative length scale of the apparatus (Kirkgöz & Ardiçlioğlu 1997). This is the ratio between the cross-sectional area of the channel and the wetted perimeter:\nR ¼ A=Pð1Þ\nwhere: R = the hydraulic radius (m), A = the cross-sectional area of flow (m 2 ) and P = the wetted perimeter (m). Reynolds numbers were calculated using the formula:\nRe ¼ 4VR=vð2Þ\nwhere V is the water velocity and v is the kinematic viscosity. Calculated in this way, laminar flow occurs below 500, transitional or turbulent flow between 500 and 2000, and only turbulent flow when Reynolds number exceeds 2000 (Streeter 1966). Reynolds numbers for the biofilm channel, calculated under conditions of low and high flow rates, exceed 2000 indicating that the flow was turbulent under all the present test conditions. This was further verified by direct observation of dye distribution patterns at a range of flow rates: the transition from laminar to turbulent flow occurring between Reynolds numbers of 1350 and 2325.\n\n\nFroude numbers\n\nThe Froude number is a measure of the ratio of inertial force to gravitational force and is important in determining the length of the flow development zone.

[29] Note that ions in different half volumes interact with each other and contribute to the overall repulsion between the two half volumes. On the y-axis of Fig. 1 we have the ratio of the separating force between two charges in an ionic solution to the Coulomb force without an ionic solution. On the x-axis of Fig. 1 we have the distance between the charges q 1 and q 2 . In this case both q 1 and q 2 equal the charge of a single proton. We see that the ratio reaches a plateau of about 6 at around 4 nm. That is, due to the symmetry between the charge distribution in the two half volumes, the repulsive force between the two half volumes due to q 1 and q 2 is increased six-fold as compared to their Coulomb repulsion. This ratio remains approximately constant over the range of the calculation. As was shown previously, this ratio is significantly increased if the amount of charge in q 1 and q 2 is increased.

In 1881, Worthington had already proposed that the surface tension of a liquid can be determined from the shape of a hanging drop, which is deformed by gravity [22][23][24]. Shortly thereafter, in 1883, Bashford and Adams published numerical tables for the approximate solutions of the axially symmetric Young-Laplace equation [25]. The Young-Laplace equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation describing the capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between the liquid and a gas phase (or across the interface between the liquid and another immiscible liquid phase) due to the surface (or the interfacial) tension γ. This equation is still used today to derive γ. The shape of the drop is determined by a single dimensionless quantity β = ∆ρ g R 0 2 /γ as a measure of the ratio of gravitational and interfacial forces. Therein, ∆ρ is the density difference between the liquid and the second phase to account for the drop buoyancy, g the acceleration due to gravity and R 0 the radius of the drop curvature at its apex [25]. In 1947, β was defined as the 'Bond number' by Merrington and Richardson [26]. The surface (interfacial) tension thus can be directly obtained from the density, gravitational force and drop size if the bond number can be accurately determined from the drop shape. This, however, proved to be challenging for some systems, particularly for drops strongly elongated due to a low surface tension with just R 0 as the characteristic drop shape parameter. In 1938, Andreas et al. demonstrated an improved approach to determine γ from the aspherical drop shape [27]: this approach is based on the value S = d s / d e , which is the ratio of the maximum drop diameter, d e , and the drop diameter, d s , measured at a distance d e from the apex (see Figure S1 of Supporting Information, SI). This ratio S is then compared with tables calculated experimentally by Andreas et al., which correlate the bond number and interfacial tension. These tables were further improved over time by numerical integration of the Young-Laplace equation [27,28]. Today, standard programs to calculate surface tension are based on the ADSA",

Unlike neutral gases, where diffusion is controlled by Fick's law, the presence of an electric field can change the way in which the particles are redistributed in an inhomogeneous mixture. Even when no external electric field is applied, a displacement of charged particles would create a charge imbalance that, in turn, would induce an electric field opposing the charge displacement. This effect can be taken into account by defining the diffusion velocity V k as [8,14] ρY V k j = −ρD j\n∂Y i ∂x + Z k ρν k Y i E,(1)\nwhere Z k is negative if the species is negatively charged, positive if the species is positively charged and zero if the species is neutral.

Electromagnetism generates a repulsive force between charges having the same polarity while charges with opposite polarities will be attracted to one another. The magnitude of the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The fundamental principles of magnetic coupling can be understood by examining the relationship between the thermodynamic behavior and electromagnetic properties of gas molecules dissolved in water. In the model used for the present calculations, water molecules are diamagnetic and have a cluster structure while oxygen is paramagnetic with two unpaired electrons in the molecule. Hydrogen and nitrogen are treated as quadrupole molecules that exhibit electrical polarity, and water molecules have a dipole moment based on the presence of two protons. As a result of the Earth's magnetic field, these molecules undergo Zeeman splitting along with the effect of intramolecular charges, and so will show a magnetic  PLOS ONE resonance energy. The energy values were determined using a magnetic field strength of 1.00 x 10 −4 T, taking into account the magnetic moments for oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen together with basic quantum chemistry calculations and magnetic resonance theory. As shown in Fig 3, the Gibbs energy values for gaseous oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen dissolved in water showed significant correlation (R 2 = 0.9946) with the molecule-specific magnetic moments. This result suggests that the difference between the positive electric properties of water molecules and the negative electric properties of oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen are involved in intermolecular bonding.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe dissolution of gas molecules in water was determined to involve an exchange of energy in response to excitation by a magnetic field. Variations in the solubility of several gases with temperature were also reproduced by quantum chemistry calculations, using a magnetic field strength of 1.00 x 10 −4 T, which is equivalent to that of the Earth magnetic field. The bond between water and gas molecules was an electric charge-dependent Coulomb bond. And also, The hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces in water were determined to reversibly generate cluster structures as a consequence of the effects of both the Earth's magnetic field and temperature.

One can obtain the electric field at a given position by applying Gauss law and the superposition principle [26]. The result is simple: the electric field is given by the difference of the sum of the charges at the left and the right sides of the considered position. This field remains constant as long as one does not cross a particle, in which case it will change by an amount ±2q, where q is the charge that has been crossed, and the sign depends on whether the cross was from left to right (+) or right to left (−). In our one-dimensional picture, the situation is that of two charges Q > 0 located at x = 0 and x = L. Between them, there are N counterions, which are particles with charge e = −2Q/N at positions x 1 , · · · , x N . Overall, the system is thus neutral. The charges Q are at fixed positions, but the counterions can freely move, and are at thermal equilibrium at temperature T [9]. The natural framework to study this system is the canonical ensemble [9]. Let us denote Z(N, L, T ) the canonical partition function of the system. The corresponding free energy is\nF (N, L, T ) = −k B T ln Z(N, L, T ) where k B is Boltzmann constant.\nThe effective force between the (macromolecular) charges Q located at x = 0 and x = L is F = P (N, L, T )x wherex is a unit-vector along the x-axis and\nP (N, L, T ) = − ∂F (N, L, T ) ∂L = k B T 1 Z ∂Z ∂L .(5)\nBefore considering some particular cases for a few values of N , it is instructive to state the contact theorem, that provides a sometimes useful alternative to the force calculation along the lines of Eq.

Fig. 2(c) shows a snapshot of p e around the left edge of the drop from Fig. 2(a).

Note that the function p e (x,t) has two maxima: the left maximum excites surface waves in the precursor film, but the right maximum excites harmonic waves in the drop. Let x = ±x 0 be the positions of the left and the right edges of the drop. In the following we focus on the maximum of the function p e (x) responsible for the oscillations of the drop.

In the relevant domain of parameters in Fig. 1 (λ > 0.25) the ground state wavefunction is centered at one of G bases (left or right ones for the GG sequence and the central one for a GGG sequence).

In Ref. 16 it was shown that a quantum mechanical particle in a box obeying the NLS equation undergoes an spontaneous symmetry breaking in the probability density for a sufficiently large value of the nonlinear potential. The particle is confined either on the left or the right of the box and it is possible to produce tunnelling between the two situations under the presence of an external stochastic potential. The NLS, which is the equivalent to (1) for a continuous system, reads\nγ∇ 2 ψ(r) + β |ψ(r)| 2 ψ(r) = Eψ(r),(4)\nwhere ψ(r) is subject to the boundary conditions ψ(r)| ±a/2 = 0, with a = size of the box.

For small ρ, an spontaneous self-localization of the wavefunction either to the left or the right of the box occurs [16], both sides playing the equivalent roles of the donor-acceptor sites in (1). The continuous model (4) allows the inclusion of an electric field competing with the stability of the self-localized ground state. The presence of an external potential, in the one-dimensional problem, is added to (4) through an additional term on the righthand side of the form:\nV 0 1 − 2x a ψ(x),(5)\nwhere V 0 is a constant, and r ≡ x in this case.

The beads interact by excluded volume, in the sense that they are impenetrable and cannot overlap. Since the system is confined in 1 dimension, the order is also necessarily preserved, as in the single file dynamics and this has important consequences for the statistical behaviour of the constrained beads in the bulk [38]. Moreover growth is also implemented: each bead can give birth to an identical bead of the same size next to it, left or right, at a rate µ and only if there is space. The actual probability for a particle in x i to give birth on the right in the time interval dt is then µdt/2 multiplied by the probability of the space between x i + r and x i + 3r being empty. A wall is placed at x = 0 and it has the same effect of a fixed bead at x = 0 − r. The dynamics advances at intervals of time dt in which beads displace and have chance to duplicate in a random order, the overlap between beads is treated as a kind of inelastic interaction: the particle of interest is displaced as much as there is place and then, in case of overlap, it is placed next to the neighbouring bead, which means at the minimal distance 2r from the its centre. Note that here the advection is not implemented as a pure transport on the whole population, but as a biased drift on each individual movement. The front is defined as the position of the most advanced particle, x f (t), and the front speed as the derivative, c = dx f /dt. It is numerically estimated as the slope of linear regression on values of front position on time, averaged over independent realizations. Depending on the direction of the drift v, the dynamics is classified in three classes: the no-flow v = 0, the counter-flow v < 0 or the co-flow v > 0 case. At zero velocity the front speed is given by a constant, plus a term which scales as the Fisher speed: c 0 (D) = c min + A √ D, however even in the limit D → 0 the front can proceed at its minimum speed, which is given by duplication of the most advanced particle, at velocity given by one body size = 2r",

The radius of the tube linearly grows in space (see Fig. 1). When diffusion occurs in quasi-one-dimensional structures, one can map particle motion onto an effective one-dimensional (1D) description in terms of diffusion along the channel axis. The key point of the derivation is the assumption of equilibration in the transverse direction. When the system geometry is smoothly varying along the x-coordinate measured along the tube/channel axis, the simplest one-dimensional description is given by the Fick-Jacobs equation [2]. In terms of the probability distribution c(x, t), the FJ equation reads\n∂c(x, t) ∂t = D 0 ∂ ∂x A(x) ∂ ∂x c(x, t) A(x) ,(1)\nwhere D 0 is the bare diffusion constant, A(x) is the crosssection area πR 2 (x) of a tube of radius R(x), or the width w(x) of a two-dimensional channel. It has been shown that a more accurate reduction to the 1D description results in a position-dependent diffusivity D(x). Then the probability density in the channel satisfies a modified Fick-Jacobs equation which was first derived by Zwanzig [3] ∂c(x, t) ∂t\n= ∂ ∂x D(x)A(x) ∂ ∂x c(x, t) A(x) .(2)\nConfinement in higher dimensions gives rise to an effective entropic potential in the reduced dimension.

It was found that the N ⑀2 of His 32 is optimally positioned (2.8 Å) for proton abstraction from the C2-hydroxyl group of myo-inositol, whereas its N ␦1 forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) (2.7 Å) with the O ␦1 of Asp 274 (Fig. 2, left panel). A recent NMR study showed that the H-bond between Asp 274 and His 32 in the free enzyme fits into the NMR criteria for a short strong hydrogen bond (SSHB): a highly deshielded proton resonance, a bond length of 2.64 Å, a D/H fractionation factor significantly lower than 1.0, and a protection factor of Ͼ100 (5). This type of H-bond has been postulated to play a crucial role in enzymatic reactions, particularly those involving the general acid/base catalytic mechanism, by providing substantial stabilization energy (10 -20 kcal/mol) for the intermediate or transition state (6). However, we have shown that replacing Asp 274 with an asparagine residue has a relatively mild effect (40-fold decrease) on catalysis (4). In addition, x-ray structural analyses showed that the side chain of Asn 274 in D274N is virtually unchanged when compared with Asp 274 in WT, and Asn 274 still forms a hydrogen bonding interaction with N ␦1 of His 32 (3) (Fig. 2, right panel). These data led us to ask the following questions: (i) Does SSHB exist in mutants D274N and D274E and therefore account for the mild effect on catalysis? (ii) If the answer is no, what is the difference between a SSHB and a regular HB in their energetic contributions to catalysis? (iii) Can the role of Asp 274 in the catalytic dyad be further dissected?",

This shift results from changes in vibrational zero point energy due to isotopic substitution. We assume the harmonic approximation and use,\nT o = T e + E upper o + E lower o (6)\nwhere T o is the observed 0-0 band origin for a given isotopomer, T e is the energy difference between the two potential surface minima, and E upper o and E lower o are the zero point energies for theÃ andX states respectively. E lower o is taken from the ab initio work of Hargiss and Ermler [32] while T o was known for each of our isotopomers. Constraining T e to be constant and utilizing our determined values for the otherÃ state force constants, f rr was varied to reproduce the observed band origins for the two pure isotopomers. We then used the T o values for the mixed isotopomers as a consistency check. Using this procedure, f rr was determined to be 4.2 aJ/Å 2 while T e was found at 48070 cm −1 .\n\nThe determined value for f rr is approximately 80% of the value determined by Rosmus and coworkers [13]. We attribute this discrepancy to a neglect of anharmonicity in the excited state potential. In order to estimate these effects, we use the ab initio values for X N H = -236 cm −1 and X N D = -118 cm −1 and correct for the anharmonicity of the excited state.

[25] directly addressed this problem with a fractional diffusion equation approach. Seki et al. [23] went beyond the CTRW model and derived a fractional reaction-diffusion equation for the geminate recombination problem, and one finds some disagreement between the assumptions and results in this work and that in [25]. The fractional diffusion approach has recently been used to get exact solutions for two types of one-dimensional trapping problems: the so called one-sided problem, in which all the traps lie on one side of the particle, and the two-sided problem, in which the traps are located on both sides of the particle (this is the traditional or standard version of the trapping problem) [26]. The fractional-diffusion approach has also been employed to study other bimolecular reactions between subdiffusive particles. In particular, the annihilation A + A → ∅ and coagulation A+A → A of subdiffusive particles was studied [27] by means of a fractional generalization of the interparticle distribution function method [4]. The evolution of reaction-subdiffusion fronts for A + B → C reactions, where both A and B move subdiffusively, is also amenable to analysis by means of the fractional diffusion approach [28]. Other recent work on fractional diffusion and CTRW models of subdiffusive reacting particles can be found in a number of references [29].",

Therefore, in the following, only d WAXS values are discussed in order to guarantee phase state-independent comparability of the results. Moreover, this allows also to discuss the results from temperatures where the lipids are not in well defined phase states (e.g., close to T m ). A detailed description of DMPC's gel phase structure as determined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction was reported by Tristam-Nagle et al. in Reference [44]. These authors report an area per lipid of 47 Å 2 for DMPC at around 10 • C. WAXS experiments were performed between 10 • C and 50 • C (∆T = 5 • C with a heating rate of 20 • C/min). The samples were measured in a flow-through Kapton capillary (1 mm, GoodFellow GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany) in a Linkam stage (Linkam Scientific, Tadworth, UK). WAXS experiments were performed at the ID02 beamline at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble, France [45]. The data were recorded with a CCD Rayonix LX-170HS detector at a sample-to-detector distance of 0.12 m and a wavelength of 1 Å. Recording time was 25 × 1 s (for DMPC SUVs 10 × 1 s) and the reduced curves were averaged. Initial data treatment was done using the beamlines data reduction program package [46]. The sample scattering was normalized with respect to incident intensity, sample thickness, acquisition time, transmission and background and was brought to absolute scale using water. Moreover, a constant background was subtracted for better visualization of the data. In scattering experiments, the intensity I(q) amounts to I(q) = N(∆ρ) 2 V 2 P(q)S(q) and depends on number of particles (N), particle volume (V), contrast in the form of the X-ray scattering length density differences (XSLD; ∆ρ = ρ particle − ρ solvent ), particle form factor (P(q)) and structure factor (S(q)).

One can obtain the electric field at a given position by applying Gauss law and the superposition principle [26]. The result is simple: the electric field is given by the difference of the sum of the charges at the left and the right sides of the considered position. This field remains constant as long as one does not cross a particle, in which case it will change by an amount ±2q, where q is the charge that has been crossed, and the sign depends on whether the cross was from left to right (+) or right to left (−). In our one-dimensional picture, the situation is that of two charges Q > 0 located at x = 0 and x = L. Between them, there are N counterions, which are particles with charge e = −2Q/N at positions x 1 , · · · , x N . Overall, the system is thus neutral. The charges Q are at fixed positions, but the counterions can freely move, and are at thermal equilibrium at temperature T [9]. The natural framework to study this system is the canonical ensemble [9]. Let us denote Z(N, L, T ) the canonical partition function of the system.

Fig. 2(c) shows a snapshot of p e around the left edge of the drop from Fig. 2(a).

Note that the function p e (x,t) has two maxima: the left maximum excites surface waves in the precursor film, but the right maximum excites harmonic waves in the drop. Let x = ±x 0 be the positions of the left and the right edges of the drop. In the following we focus on the maximum of the function p e (x) responsible for the oscillations of the drop.

In the relevant domain of parameters in Fig. 1 (λ > 0.25) the ground state wavefunction is centered at one of G bases (left or right ones for the GG sequence and the central one for a GGG sequence).

In Ref. 16 it was shown that a quantum mechanical particle in a box obeying the NLS equation undergoes an spontaneous symmetry breaking in the probability density for a sufficiently large value of the nonlinear potential. The particle is confined either on the left or the right of the box and it is possible to produce tunnelling between the two situations under the presence of an external stochastic potential. The NLS, which is the equivalent to (1) for a continuous system, reads\nγ∇ 2 ψ(r) + β |ψ(r)| 2 ψ(r) = Eψ(r),(4)\nwhere ψ(r) is subject to the boundary conditions ψ(r)| ±a/2 = 0, with a = size of the box.

For small ρ, an spontaneous self-localization of the wavefunction either to the left or the right of the box occurs [16], both sides playing the equivalent roles of the donor-acceptor sites in (1). The continuous model (4) allows the inclusion of an electric field competing with the stability of the self-localized ground state. The presence of an external potential, in the one-dimensional problem, is added to (4) through an additional term on the righthand side of the form:\nV 0 1 − 2x a ψ(x),(5)\nwhere V 0 is a constant, and r ≡ x in this case.

The beads interact by excluded volume, in the sense that they are impenetrable and cannot overlap. Since the system is confined in 1 dimension, the order is also necessarily preserved, as in the single file dynamics and this has important consequences for the statistical behaviour of the constrained beads in the bulk [38]. Moreover growth is also implemented: each bead can give birth to an identical bead of the same size next to it, left or right, at a rate µ and only if there is space. The actual probability for a particle in x i to give birth on the right in the time interval dt is then µdt/2 multiplied by the probability of the space between x i + r and x i + 3r being empty. A wall is placed at x = 0 and it has the same effect of a fixed bead at x = 0 − r. The dynamics advances at intervals of time dt in which beads displace and have chance to duplicate in a random order, the overlap between beads is treated as a kind of inelastic interaction: the particle of interest is displaced as much as there is place and then, in case of overlap, it is placed next to the neighbouring bead, which means at the minimal distance 2r from the its centre. Note that here the advection is not implemented as a pure transport on the whole population, but as a biased drift on each individual movement. The front is defined as the position of the most advanced particle, x f (t), and the front speed as the derivative, c = dx f /dt. It is numerically estimated as the slope of linear regression on values of front position on time, averaged over independent realizations. Depending on the direction of the drift v, the dynamics is classified in three classes: the no-flow v = 0, the counter-flow v < 0 or the co-flow v > 0 case. At zero velocity the front speed is given by a constant, plus a term which scales as the Fisher speed: c 0 (D) = c min + A √ D, however even in the limit D → 0 the front can proceed at its minimum speed, which is given by duplication of the most advanced particle, at velocity given by one body size = 2r",

The radius of the tube linearly grows in space (see Fig. 1). When diffusion occurs in quasi-one-dimensional structures, one can map particle motion onto an effective one-dimensional (1D) description in terms of diffusion along the channel axis. The key point of the derivation is the assumption of equilibration in the transverse direction. When the system geometry is smoothly varying along the x-coordinate measured along the tube/channel axis, the simplest one-dimensional description is given by the Fick-Jacobs equation [2]. In terms of the probability distribution c(x, t), the FJ equation reads\n∂c(x, t) ∂t = D 0 ∂ ∂x A(x) ∂ ∂x c(x, t) A(x) ,(1)\nwhere D 0 is the bare diffusion constant, A(x) is the crosssection area πR 2 (x) of a tube of radius R(x), or the width w(x) of a two-dimensional channel. It has been shown that a more accurate reduction to the 1D description results in a position-dependent diffusivity D(x). Then the probability density in the channel satisfies a modified Fick-Jacobs equation which was first derived by Zwanzig [3] ∂c(x, t) ∂t\n= ∂ ∂x D(x)A(x) ∂ ∂x c(x, t) A(x) .(2)\nConfinement in higher dimensions gives rise to an effective entropic potential in the reduced dimension.

It was found that the N ⑀2 of His 32 is optimally positioned (2.8 Å) for proton abstraction from the C2-hydroxyl group of myo-inositol, whereas its N ␦1 forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) (2.7 Å) with the O ␦1 of Asp 274 (Fig. 2, left panel). A recent NMR study showed that the H-bond between Asp 274 and His 32 in the free enzyme fits into the NMR criteria for a short strong hydrogen bond (SSHB): a highly deshielded proton resonance, a bond length of 2.64 Å, a D/H fractionation factor significantly lower than 1.0, and a protection factor of Ͼ100 (5). This type of H-bond has been postulated to play a crucial role in enzymatic reactions, particularly those involving the general acid/base catalytic mechanism, by providing substantial stabilization energy (10 -20 kcal/mol) for the intermediate or transition state (6). However, we have shown that replacing Asp 274 with an asparagine residue has a relatively mild effect (40-fold decrease) on catalysis (4). In addition, x-ray structural analyses showed that the side chain of Asn 274 in D274N is virtually unchanged when compared with Asp 274 in WT, and Asn 274 still forms a hydrogen bonding interaction with N ␦1 of His 32 (3) (Fig. 2, right panel). These data led us to ask the following questions: (i) Does SSHB exist in mutants D274N and D274E and therefore account for the mild effect on catalysis? (ii) If the answer is no, what is the difference between a SSHB and a regular HB in their energetic contributions to catalysis? (iii) Can the role of Asp 274 in the catalytic dyad be further dissected?",

This shift results from changes in vibrational zero point energy due to isotopic substitution. We assume the harmonic approximation and use,\nT o = T e + E upper o + E lower o (6)\nwhere T o is the observed 0-0 band origin for a given isotopomer, T e is the energy difference between the two potential surface minima, and E upper o and E lower o are the zero point energies for theÃ andX states respectively. E lower o is taken from the ab initio work of Hargiss and Ermler [32] while T o was known for each of our isotopomers. Constraining T e to be constant and utilizing our determined values for the otherÃ state force constants, f rr was varied to reproduce the observed band origins for the two pure isotopomers. We then used the T o values for the mixed isotopomers as a consistency check. Using this procedure, f rr was determined to be 4.2 aJ/Å 2 while T e was found at 48070 cm −1 .\n\nThe determined value for f rr is approximately 80% of the value determined by Rosmus and coworkers [13]. We attribute this discrepancy to a neglect of anharmonicity in the excited state potential. In order to estimate these effects, we use the ab initio values for X N H = -236 cm −1 and X N D = -118 cm −1 and correct for the anharmonicity of the excited state.

[25] directly addressed this problem with a fractional diffusion equation approach. Seki et al. [23] went beyond the CTRW model and derived a fractional reaction-diffusion equation for the geminate recombination problem, and one finds some disagreement between the assumptions and results in this work and that in [25]. The fractional diffusion approach has recently been used to get exact solutions for two types of one-dimensional trapping problems: the so called one-sided problem, in which all the traps lie on one side of the particle, and the two-sided problem, in which the traps are located on both sides of the particle (this is the traditional or standard version of the trapping problem) [26]. The fractional-diffusion approach has also been employed to study other bimolecular reactions between subdiffusive particles. In particular, the annihilation A + A → ∅ and coagulation A+A → A of subdiffusive particles was studied [27] by means of a fractional generalization of the interparticle distribution function method [4]. The evolution of reaction-subdiffusion fronts for A + B → C reactions, where both A and B move subdiffusively, is also amenable to analysis by means of the fractional diffusion approach [28]. Other recent work on fractional diffusion and CTRW models of subdiffusive reacting particles can be found in a number of references [29].",

Therefore, in the following, only d WAXS values are discussed in order to guarantee phase state-independent comparability of the results. Moreover, this allows also to discuss the results from temperatures where the lipids are not in well defined phase states (e.g., close to T m ). A detailed description of DMPC's gel phase structure as determined by wide-angle X-ray diffraction was reported by Tristam-Nagle et al. in Reference [44]. These authors report an area per lipid of 47 Å 2 for DMPC at around 10 • C. WAXS experiments were performed between 10 • C and 50 • C (∆T = 5 • C with a heating rate of 20 • C/min). The samples were measured in a flow-through Kapton capillary (1 mm, GoodFellow GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany) in a Linkam stage (Linkam Scientific, Tadworth, UK). WAXS experiments were performed at the ID02 beamline at the ESRF synchrotron in Grenoble, France [45]. The data were recorded with a CCD Rayonix LX-170HS detector at a sample-to-detector distance of 0.12 m and a wavelength of 1 Å. Recording time was 25 × 1 s (for DMPC SUVs 10 × 1 s) and the reduced curves were averaged. Initial data treatment was done using the beamlines data reduction program package [46]. The sample scattering was normalized with respect to incident intensity, sample thickness, acquisition time, transmission and background and was brought to absolute scale using water. Moreover, a constant background was subtracted for better visualization of the data. In scattering experiments, the intensity I(q) amounts to I(q) = N(∆ρ) 2 V 2 P(q)S(q) and depends on number of particles (N), particle volume (V), contrast in the form of the X-ray scattering length density differences (XSLD; ∆ρ = ρ particle − ρ solvent ), particle form factor (P(q)) and structure factor (S(q)).

The hyperfine coupling increases linearly with pressure, which we explain using a microscopic model of electron wavefunction distortion mediated by van der Waals interactions between the ni-trogen atom and the cage. Using this model and theoretical estimates of the bulk modulus of isolated fullerene molecules, 10-14 we then estimate the pressure shift and compare it with our experimental results. The predicted shift is smaller than the observed shift, which may indicate contributions beyond the van der Waals interaction as well as uncertainty in the the theoretical bulk modulus. To the best of our knowledge, the value deduced from our model is the first experimental estimate of bulk modulus for an individual C 60 molecule under conditions of hydrostatic pressure.\n\nWe find that the measured linewidth increases nonlinearly with pressure. This is explained by the pressuredependent viscosity of the solvent 15 and its effect on rotational diffusion 16 of fullerene clusters. [17][18][19] At low pressure, the solvent is sufficiently non-viscous that dipoledipole coupling between spins is averaged out by rotation of the cluster. At high pressure, the solvent viscosity increases, leading to an increase in the linewidth towards the rigid lattice limit. 20\n\n\nII. HYPERFINE COUPLING\n\n\nA. Experiment\n\nA 15 N@C 60 sample was prepared by ion implantation, 4 dissolved in toluene, and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography to a purity (N@C 60 :C 60 ) of ∼0.6 %. 21 The sample used for high-pressure measurements was then concentrated by bubbling nitrogen gas through it to evaporate some solvent. This is because the small sample volume of the pressure cell leads to a low resonator filling factor, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the measurement. This sample was then injected into an yttria-stabilised zirconia cell attached to a barocycler and loaded into a dielectric resonator (Bruker ER4123D). Measurements were performed at the X band (frequency f ∼ 9.5 GHz) using a Bruker EMXmicro spectrometer. All measurements were performed at room temperature, with sufficient time between increasing the pressure and performing the measurement to allow thermal equilibriation.",

The far infrared/sub-millimetre emission appears to arise from an extended (3 light-year radius) disk of gas and dust rotating around the active galactic nucleus (or AGN - Barvainis et al. 1997, Alloin et al. 1997, Bradford et al. 2009).\n\nThe molecular emission is currently the object of high sensitivity line surveys using NOEMA and ALMA. Thirty four molecular lines pertaining to fourteen molecular species are identified within the (still partly) surveyed 200 GHz-wide frequency band covering the rest frequency ranges: 338 to 365 GHz, 526 to 626 GHz and 705 to 786 GHz. (see Figs. 11 and 12). Some of those lines correspond to different rotational transitions of the same species, such as the J→J' = 1-0, 4-3, 6-5, 7-6, and 8-7 transitions of HCN and HCO + , the 4-3, 6-5, 8-7 transitions of HNC, the 1-0, 3-2, 4-3, 6-5, 8-7, 9-8 transitions of 12 CO, the main isotopologue of CO, as well as the 5-4 and 7-6 transitions of the rare isotopologues 13 CO and C 18 O.\n\nThe detected lines sample a wide range of energy levels and opacities for a given molecule, and different excitation conditions for molecules that are believed to be coeval. From this, and from the spectral energy distribution of the quasar continuum emission, it is possible to assess the density, temperature and radiation field in the emitting region, as well as the molecular abundances. The constancy of the line width (half-power width 440 kms −1 ) seems to imply that the molecules are distributed throughout the same rotating cloud complex.",

In cold, dark clouds such as TMC-1 where the linewidths are comparable to those measured with our CE-FTMW spectrometer, it is thus necessary to consider hyperfine splitting, as recent work on PhCN [4] demonstrates. This is particularly true for a relatively heavy molecule like PhC 3 N whose strongest lines should lie at centimeter-wavelengths at low temperatures ( Fig. 6): at 10 K, the strongest features correspond to J = 21 around 23 GHz, while at 6 K -a typical temperature for molecules in TMC-1-the strongest features are near 15 GHz (J = 14). Thus, the X/K u (8-12/12-18 GHz) bands appear to be the most promising to detect PhC 3 N in TMC-1. In sources with somewhat warmer temperatures, the intensity of individual transitions is significantly decreased due to the larger partition function, and the peak intensity, although relatively flat, falls in the W (75-110 GHz) and N (100-200 GHz) bands.\n\nDetection of multiple isomers is also a powerful tool for constraining physical and chemical conditions in astrophysical environments.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the central-field approximation, atomic nitrogen has no hyperfine coupling because the combined spin density of the three unpaired p orbitals vanishes at the nucleus and is spherically symmetric outside it. 1 In reality, interactions beyond this approximation lead to a non-zero hyperfine coupling for the free atom. 2 In the presence of other atoms or molecules, distortion of the electron orbitals further modifies the hyperfine coupling, which therefore offers an insight into the nature of the interatomic interactions. 3 The endohedral fullerene N@C 60 offers a nearly unique system in which the fullerene cage stabilises the encapsulated nitrogen such that it behaves like a free atom. 4 However, the hyperfine coupling of N@C 60 is enhanced by approximately 50% relative to the free atomic value, which reflects the effect of confinement of the nitrogen orbitals by the cage. This increase has previously been attributed to nitrogen-cage interactions that mix in excited states with larger hyperfine couplings, although without proposing a microscopic model. 4 Understanding the hyperfine coupling of this molecule is important due to its potential use as a molecular spin qubit 5 or frequency reference in an atomic clock. 6 In particular, 15 N@C 60 is suitable as a frequency reference due to its sharp resonances 7 and the existence of a clock transition in its low-field spectrum. 8 Since the frequency of this clock transition depends solely on the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant A, it is important to characterise the mechanisms that affect it. For example, the hyperfine coupling is known to depend on temperature, 9 which could reduce the long term stability of a fullerene clock against environmental temperature fluctuations.",

This molecule is also of astronomical interest, because 391 rotational transitions in its ground torsional state have been observed in star forming regions such as Sgr B2 and OMC-1 [1]. The microwave spectrum of this molecule has been observed up to 608 GHz, and rotational transitions in the ground torsional state have been extensively analyzed by several researchers [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. For excited torsional states, however, no transition has been assigned as far as we know. An analysis of rotational transitions in excited torsional states is important to determine an effective Hamiltonian of this molecule, since many molecular parameters of the Hamiltonian can only become free of correlation when data from excited torsional states is available. An analysis of excited state lines is also important to identify astrophysical unidentified lines. Star forming regions where the existence of methyl formate has been confirmed are relatively hot and many unidentified lines from these regions are supposed to be excited torsional state lines of methyl formate.\n\nIn this study, we have observed the microwave spectrum of methyl formate in the 7− 200 GHz region and assigned new 437 lines to the first excited A torsional substate. Both the first excited torsional state lines and the ground state lines reported previously [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] were analyzed simultaneously on the basis of an internal axis method (IAM) Hamiltonian [10]. A total of 3514 lines were fitted to a 1σ standard deviation of 179 kHz, and molecular parameters were determined.\n\n\nExperimental Procedure and Assignments",

The resulting rotational spectrum is expected to have its most intense lines around 150 GHz and to be spread over a few hundreds GHz with a line spacing of about 1 GHz.\n\n\nLABORATORY WORK\n\nCorannulene is a polar, symmetric-top PAH with a bowl shaped structure (see Fig. 1). The rotational energy levels of symmetric-top molecules are segregated into series of K-stacks, distinguished by the value of the rotational angular momentum K along the molecular symmetry axis. For parallel bands, the selection rule for the K quantum number is ∆K = 0, so that only levels within the same stack can be connected through a rotational transition. In an ideal rigid symmetric top molecule, the J → J+1 transition has the same frequency along each stack, but in reality centrifugal distortion generally separates the transitions in well resolved lines, the high-J transitions being more affected by this effect. The high resolution rotational spectrum of corannulene has been measured by Lovas et al. (2005) by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy (FTMW) up to J = 19 with no K-splitting observed up to this line, leading to an upper limit of ∆JK = 2.3 × 10 −6 for the centrifugal distortion constant. For a radio astronomical detection, higher J transitions (J > 100) are required because of the expected excitation pattern of corannulene by the impinging UV radiation field. It is thus of great importance to know whether K-splitting is still negligible for high-J transitions.",

The extension of the interaction distance between the radiation and the absorbing molecule has been very successfully exploited in the infrared with multiple pass sample cells and even resonant cavities. The difficulty encountered when trying to associate these techniques with a photomixing source is the highly divergent low power source beam [25,26]. Nevertheless careful characterization of the divergence of the THz beam combined with the calculation of beam diameter at all points along its trajectory have allowed a standard (Infrared Analysis, 35-V) multi-pass cell to be integrated into the spectrometer. This cell has been used at frequencies from 300 GHz to 1.7 THz offering a variable path length in the region of 2 m to 20 m with throughputs varying from 10% to 45%. An optical path length of 13.4 m allowed rotational transitions of the OC 34 S and O 13 CS isotopes to be observed (natural abundancies are 4.2% and 1.0%, respectively, Figure 3a). The OC 34 S transition at 521.7 GHz is distorted by an intense OCS line at 522.6 GHz. The O 13 CS transition is observed at 520.9 GHz and the line at 521.0 GHz is the excited symmetric stretching ν 1 mode. The O 13 CS line has a tabulated intensity of 2 × 10 -23 cm -1 /(molecule.cm -2 ), indicating that for pure gases the spectrometer is capable of resolving line intensities as weak as 10 -25 cm -1 /(molecule.cm -2 ). The sensitivity is also demonstrated by the pure rotational spectra of vinyl chloride (C 2 H 3 Cl) for various path lengths (Figure 3b) [27]. A single pass with a path length of 24 cm required a pressure of 29 mbar to obtain a reasonable absorption signal, at this pressure no individual lines can be resolved. As the path length is increased lower gas pressures can be used and the lines can be resolved, increasing from 224 cm to 896 cm reveals further transitions.",

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

To our knowledge there are only two spectral line surveys of dark clouds, both in the direction of TMC-1. One was carried out using the Nobeyama radio telescope Kaifu et al. 2004) in the 8.8-50 GHz domain, with 414 detected lines arising from 38 different molecules, 11 of them unknown prior to the survey. Only two of the 38 species are diatomic (CS and SO), four are triatomic and the rest are polyatomic, the longest one having 11 atoms (HC 9 N). The other survey was performed at lower frequencies, with the Arecibo radio telescope (Kalenskii et al. 2004), covering the range 4-6 GHz besides selected frequencies in the 8-10 GHz interval. They detected 29 lines arising from carbon-chain species such as C 4 H, H 2 C 4 , HC 3 N, HC 5 N, HC 7 N, HC 9 N, C 2 S and C 3 S.\n\nApart from CO and NO, all observed molecules in dark clouds usually have large dipole moments and most of them have rather low abundances (a few 10 −10 ). From this, one would naively expect that only polyatomic molecules with a large dipole moment should be detectable. Due to the low kinetic temperature of these clouds, heavy molecules will have their emission peak in the centimeter and millimeter wavelength domains.

These two transitions, as can be seen from Figures 2 and 3, do not have equal intensities in the laboratory spectrum, with the A species transition being more intense; we attribute this to the E species population cooling into the K = 1 ladder (which is lower in energy than the K = 0 ladder due to internal rotation interactions) in the cold (T rot ~ 2 K) supersonic jet.

The least-squares-fit analysis using XIAM included 4199 A and E state transitions between 83 GHz and 330 GHz. The overall Hamiltonian in XIAM with the parameters from Tables 1 and 2 describes the A-E splitting up to sub-millimeterwave frequencies with an uncertainty of 81.7 kHz. Furthermore, the barrier height to internal rotation V 3 was determined to be V 3 = 882.7835(1.7179) cm −1 . Anharmonic frequency calculations were performed on the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, which are in good agreement with the experiment with rotational constants up to quartic centrifugal distortion parameters; the calculated sextic centrifugal distortion parameters showed larger deviations but they were not relevant in the initial assignment procedure. The rotational constants are in good agreement with the values reported in Ref. [6]. The results of PO−d 5,6 were compared to those of the main isotopologue, and the influence of the deuterium substitution on the structure and internal rotational motion was briefly discussed.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTFG, RP, DK and PS acknowledge the funding by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) -Projektnummer 328961117 -CRC 1319 ELCH.

Townes, such sources started to be used to study molecular spectra.It was understood (see Herzberg's book Diatomic Molecules) that radicals with an odd number of electrons, such as CH, CN and OH, have a non-zero angular momentum and/or a non-zero electronic spin .The interaction of and with the magnetic field caused by the end-over-end rotation of the molecule backbone (and by the spin of its nuclei) splits the rotational levels into fine structure (fs) sublevels (and into hyperfine structure -hfs -sublevels) with slightly different energies.Transitions between those sub-levels give rise to low frequency transitions (few GHz), observable with the radio techniques of the 1960's.The radio signature of OH, 4 transitions near 1.7 GHz ( = 18-cm) connecting 2 × 2 sublevels split by -doubling and hf interactions, was characterized in the lab in 1963 and observed shortly after in dark interstellar clouds with the MIT Haystack radio telescope, a 37-m giant constructed for the tracking of the first artificial satellites ( [29]).\n\nMicrowave studies of the ammonia molecule, NH 3 , revealed an interesting property of this symmetric pyramidal compound: inversion transitions.Because the ammonia molecule may tunnel between two forms symmetrical with respect to the plane of its 3 hydrogen atoms, its rotational levels are each split into two sub-levels of slightly different energies.Transitions between those sub-levels, although weak, are not forbidden and give rise to a line at 23 GHz (1.2 cm).This \"inversion\" line of NH3 was observed in the lab by Charles H. Townes and his colleagues and detected in space in several interstellar clouds as soon as radio telescopes were capable of observing at such (at the time) a high frequency [5].",

The data for the different nP 3/2 to (n − 1)D 5/2 transitions overlap reasonably well to form a peak centered at the inversion splitting of ammonia. The data for transitions with a given n typically lies below the data with n − 1, which is consistent with the decreasing transition dipole moment for higher electric fields. Moreover, the data fits quite well to a theoretical spectrum. The theoretical spectrum is calculated as follows.

The use of different broadband spectrometers allowed us to sample with continuity wide portions of the spectrum: at centimetre wavelength, the intervals 2-8 GHz, 13-15.5 GHz, and 18-26 GHz were covered, and in the mmW region, the full W-band (75-110 GHz) and the 260-295 GHz range were studied. The low-J lines recorded below 26 GHz show complex hyperfine patterns due to the quadrupole coupling of the two 14 N nuclei. For these transitions, 119 separate components were accurately measured. The final analysis comprises 698 transitions, which were fitted to the coefficients of the S -reduced rotational Hamiltonian, providing a very precise set of rotational and quartic centrifugal distortion constants. Three sextic and one octic parameters were also determined. The optimised values of the spectroscopic constants are in excellent agreement with the results of high-level theoretical calculations, which were performed to assist the present analysis and as a basis for future investigation focused on the imidazole isotopologues and its low-lying vibrationally excited states. This paper provides the first set of complete spectroscopic parameters of imidazole, thus allowing us to compute reliable rest frequencies in the mmW regime, a spectral region in which the features of this ring molecule reach their maximum intensity at typical ISM A53, page 7 of 8 gas temperatures. Using these improved spectral predictions, a search for imidazole was attempted in the hot core Sgr B2(N2) based on the observations of the EMoCA spectral line survey. This ring molecule is not detected. We derive a column density upper limit of 1.8 × 10 15 cm −2 , which implies that imidazole is at least 3400 times less abundant than ethyl cyanide in this source. Given that the cyclic molecule benzonitrile (c-C 6 H 5 CN) was recently detected in the molecular cloud TMC-1 (McGuire et al. 2018), the chances of detecting imidazole may be higher towards this source.",

The exponential tail at large radii r leads to a very slow convergence of the proton rms-radius as a function of the upper cutoff r cut when calculated from the integral over the charge density ρ(r). This is demonstrated in Fig. 1, which compares the convergence to the one obtained for a heavy nucleus. In order to get 98% of the proton radius, one has to integrate out to an r cut of 3 times the rms-radius. The uncertainty of this large-r tail, which is poorly fixed by the (e,e) data, corresponds to uncertainties in the shape of G(q) at very low q; this in turn complicates the stan- dard extrapolation of G(q) from the momentum transfers covered by data to q = 0 where the radius is determined from the q = 0 slope.\n\nWe illustrate the difficulties of this extrapolation with several recent results of form-factor fits.

Ziman [16] (and possibly others) who had proposed the NPA model as an intuitive physical idea in the context of solid-state physics. The electronic structure of matter is regarded as a superposition of charge densities n j ( r − R j ) centered on each nuclear center at R j . In other words, if the total charge density in momentum space was n T (k), then this is considered as being made up of the individual charge distributions n j ( k) put together using the ionic structure factor S( k). This was more explicitly implemented in muffin-tin models of solids, or 'atoms-in molecules' models of chemical bonds that were actively pursued in the 1960s, with the increasing availability of fast computers. The NPA model was formulated rigorously within T = 0 DFT by Dagens who showed that it was capable of the same level of accuracy, at least for 'simple metals' as the LMTO, APW or Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker codes that were becoming available in the 1970s [15]. Wigner's T = 0 exchange-correlation (XC) 'functional' in the local-density approximation (LDA) was used by Dagens. In the finite-T NPA that we have used as our \"workhorse\", we solve the Kohn-Sham Mermin equation for a single nucleus placed at the center of a large 'correlation sphere' of radius R c which is of the order of 10r ws , where r ws is the Wigner-Seitz radius per ion.

Traditionally, the rms-radii have been derived from data on elastic electron-proton scattering at low momentum transfer q. The best determinations are based on parameterizations of the Sachs form factors G e (q) and G m (q) with the parameters directly fitted to the observables, i.e. cross sections and polarization transfer data. The slope of the parameterized form factors at q=0 yields the charge-and magnetic rms-radii, respectively.\n\nThis topic of the proton radii has recently become a subject of intense discussion with the publication of the charge rms-radius determined from the Lamb shift in muonic Hydrogen [1]. This radius, 0.8409±0.0004fm, disagrees by many standard deviations with the value 0.8775±0.005fm from the world data on electron scattering [2], and it also disagrees with the recent value extracted from the transition energies in electronic Hydrogen [3], 0.8758±0.0077 fm. This disagreement has led to a large number of studies dealing with problems with the determination of the radii, or new physics [4]- [12].\n\nThe discrepancy has also led to renewed scrutiny of the procedure used to extract rms-radii from electron scattering data. Problematic in particular is the fact that the (e,e)-data sensitive to proton finite size are the ones in the region of momentum transfer q = 0.6÷1.2fm −1 [13]; the determination of the rms-radius involves an (implicit or explicit) extrapolation to q = 0.\n\nDifficulties due to large-r tail.",

Thus, electron rotates round the H atom nucleus with radius of 0.053 nm [2] and speed of 2 200 km·s -1 along the radon circle trajectories, and with high speed revolving on its own axis (6.6 10 15 circles/s). In a water molecule there are 2 hydrogen atoms, each of them has 1 proton with electricity of -e, and 1 \"free electron\", and can accept other additional electron rotating round their common nucleus with the same radius of random orbit and equal possibility of speed and directions. The oxygen atom can accept additional 1-2 electrons on its outer orbit sphere according to Bohr model. The most possible state is there are 2 \"free electrons\" may independently, (but under co-influence) rapid transit between H ↔ O ↔ H atoms and form some characteristic segments. Among the nucleuses of H-O-H there should be constructed a macro-stable static balance surround by electron rotation with trajectories of quasi-circle ↔hyperbola↔ ellipse and frequent changing transitions between them according to the laws of Columb's force and Kepler's movement rule. In view of scales of 10 -15 m and 10 -15 s all the oxygen and 2 hydrogen atoms would appear all \"+\", \"-\", \"0=neutral\" states in certain direction or moment in water molecule. The \"neutral state\" for atoms of oxygen and hydrogen/s may assume only under view of larger scale and statistic meaning. For easier understanding we assume the core of H-O-H is in the kernel of the water molecule frame (H + -O-H + in Figure 2), and its pattern is similar the outer pattern (self-similarity).

These simulations are called Lattice Sphere  Table I so as to keep the counter ions inside the sphere. During the simulation, the counter ions are free to move throughout the whole sphere (note that R = 52 is the radius of the volume available for counter ion motion). A repulsive Lennard-Jones potential was used between counter ions and the charged particles in the lattice so as to avoid that two oppositely charged particles to interact too strongly via Coulombic forces.

The potential of mean force, which is the reversible work required to change the distance r of the proton defect from the center of mass of the cluster, differs from the free energy F (r) = −k B T ln P proton (r) by an entropic term that depends on the surface area of a spherical shell with radius r. The potential of mean force for our 128-molecule cluster is depicted in Fig. 5, where W (r) was normalized such that it vanishes at its minimum. To carry the proton from the surface of the cluster at r ≈ 8Å into its interior a reversible work of about 4 k B T must be expended. Within a core with a radius of about 4Å the proton can be translated at no cost. This stabilization of the surface position is very similar in magnitude to the stabilization of an excess proton near a carbon nanotube membrane with respect to the bulk found in recent simulations [25]. The preferential location of the excess charge near surfaces was noted in earlier simulations [44] and is consistent with experimental data [45]. From the viewpoint of continuum electrostatics this is unexpected because a charge buried deep in the droplet is solvated in a more favorable way. The molecular details of the solvation structure of the excess proton, however, lead to a preferred surface position, presumably due to the strain exerted on the surrounding hydrogen bond network when the excess proton is in the cluster core. One may be tempted to simplify the calculation of bias forces by neglecting those force contributions that arise from the derivatives ∂c 0i /∂x α of the ground state expansion coefficients c 0i on the right hand side of Equ.

We have inspected the magnitudes of these two force terms for the bias potentials used in this study and we have found that both forces are of similar magnitude. Neglecting the derivatives ∂c 0i /∂x α is therefore unjustified.

Cumulative radial probability density of electron, which is obtained from solution of Schrodinger equation for hydrogen atom, is used and the 99% probability of electron to be existent in this volume is considered for probabilistic atomic radius definition. It is the case that spherical space volume involves 99% of electron cloud, which infers a 99% probability of an electron existence in this spherical volume.

It is widely used to calculate Van der Waals volume of atoms. For hydrogen molecules, value of Van der Waals radii is found 0.12 nm. Neutron diffraction experiments can provide an estimate experimental value of Van der Waals radius.\n\nIonic radius defines a radius for an ion in ionic crystals. Sum of ionic radiuses is utilized to estimate gaps between two adjacent oppositely charged ions [11]. Ions were assumed to be hard spherical bodies with ionic radii. The sum of ionic radii is used to estimate the distance between cations and anions in a crystal lattice. X-ray crystallography is used to estimate ionic radius of ions. Hydrogen ions lose their single electrons and they become a positive charged ion formed only by a proton nucleus without any electron. Therefore, ionic radius is not applicable for hydrogen ions so that it does not contain a valance electron to form space volume.\n\nCovalent radius is the radius that is defined for covalently bounded atoms [6]. The length of covalent bond is estimated by the sum of covalent radii [11]. For Hydrogen with single bond, covalent radius is estimated to be 0.038 nm. X-ray diffraction and rotational spectroscopy are used to estimate experimental value of covalent radius.",

The polarizabilities can be calculated very accurately within a relativistic framework, see Table 1. These calculations assume infinite nuclear mass M neglecting reduced mass corrections, finite extension of the nucleus, nuclear recoil effects (for the theory of such effects see Ref. [226]), as well as quantum electrodynamic effects (QED). The reduced mass correction f M to the energy E i of a specific state |i can easily be evaluated by coordinate scaling r → r f M with f M = M/(M + m e ) (m e is the electron mass), introduced originally by Hylleraas for the nuclear charge Z [227]. This leads to the original (infinite nuclear mass) Schrödinger equation, but with a 'mass corrected' nuclear charge Z M → Z √ M/(M + m e ). One can now easily verify that [228]. For the 1 H and 2 H hydrogen isotopes we obtain f M = 0.999456 ≈ 1 − m e /m p (m p is the proton mass) and 0.999728, respectively.

Using Z M instead and taking care of the scaling of the field term we get the mass correction for the 1 H isotope polarizability of α M = +0.00735613 a.u. This increase in polarizability is easily explained as it originates mostly from the decrease in the mass corrected nuclear charge. This effect is an order of magnitude larger than the relativistic contribution. We can also estimate QED effects, as the dominant correction comes from the 1s Lamb-level shift taken from Weitz et al.

Of course, at infinitely long distances the theory is not valid, nor at very short distances where the Coulomb potential is singular. In the case of an atom with the atomic number Z we know that the Thomas-Fermi model is not valid for distances shorter than ∼ 1/Z.

Hence, a larger effect is expected for a one-neutron halo nucleus, whereas in a two-or four-neutron halo the size of this effect strongly depends on the correlation between the halo neutrons. On the other hand, the neutron(s) in the halo interact(s) with the core nucleus and might give rise to core polarization and, hence, change the proton distribution. Information from different experiments have to be combined to disentangle these effects. Nuclear charge radii obtained from isotope-shift measurements provide accurate and reliable data about the nuclear size, since it can be extracted in a nuclear-model independent way, which has been demonstrated for lithium [42,43] and helium isotopes [44,45]. Such measurements became possible because new atomic physics calculations including quantum-electrodynamics and relativistic effects reached an accuracy of a few times 10 −6 for three-electron systems [46] for the prediction of the mass-dependent isotope shift, and similarly accurate isotope shift measurements are available. This allowed for the first time the separation of the nuclear volume contribution in very light exotic nuclei, which accounts for only a 10 −5 fraction of the total isotope shift. In addition the masses of the halo nuclides of interest have to be known with a relative precision of the order of 10 −7 or better for sufficiently accurate calculation of the mass shift. Therefore recent mass measurements that were reported for the neutron halo nuclides 6,8 He [47,48], 11 Li [49,50], 11,12 Be [51,52], and the two-proton halo candidate 17 Ne [53], provided important input data for these calculations and increased the accuracy of the charge radii results.

To simplify the model, the average energies of internucleon collisions are restricted to not exceed the production threshold of other hadrons, and only two varieties (protons and neutrons) are considered.

The later is a function of the magnitude of the external charge q, its distance (L-R) to the approaching particle and the radius R of the metal particle. Thus, the closer the external charge to the metal surface and the smaller the size of the particle is, the larger the dipole moment and, thus, the stronger the attractive dipoledipole interaction between two particles becomes. Another important fact is that attractive dipole-dipole interactions are significantly weaker and more dependent on the distance (~1/r 3 ) than the repulsive interaction between monopoles (~1/r 2 ). It is useful to consider this attractive electrostatic energy quantitatively, assuming one ion with a charge eat a distance of 0.2 nm (close to the ionic radius of Br -) from a non-grounded neutral metal sphere with a radius of 3 nm. The electrostatic energy of interaction is then -147 kJ/mol. Note that an approaching electrically neutral molecule would not lead to this type of electrostatic interaction. However, weak interaction due to dipole or higher multipole moments is possible. The electrostatic interaction energy depends on the number of ions around the nanoparticle (for simplicity we assume equal distance from the sphere and equal charge). This energy increases with growing number of ions (N) and becomes positive for N ≥ 9 (see Table 2). The electrostatic attraction energy is very high, when only few charges approach the nanoparticles and in magnitude is comparable with the energy of chemisorption. With increasing number of approaching charges, the energy becomes significantly smaller, which is particularly important in steric conception of nanoparticle stabilization as described below. When nanoparticles are approached by more than one molecule (or ion), the system becomes more complex. For example, from basic vector algebra, the overall dipole moment is reduced to zero in case of two adsorbates of the same charge approaching opposite sides of the nanoparticle and enhanced, if they are of opposite charge. Collectively, cations and anions approaching the metal particles (assuming here equal probability to approach) induce many image charges δ + and δon the surface (Fig. 2) and the particle obtains a multipole moment.

Bohr radius of hydrogen atom is considered as a physical constant to scale atomic distances [2].\n\nCritical cage radius is considered according to binding energy of ground state hydrogen atom. A spherical box is assumed to have impenetrable surface and the radius of sphere box reduced until binding energy diminishes [12,13]. A critical value of the sphere radius at which the binding energy becomes zero is called critical cage radius [7,12,13]. Binding energy of ground state of the hydrogen atom is calculated as a function of the sphere radius [13]. For hydrogen in ground state, critical cage radius is found about 1.83 ! = 0.097 nm [7].\n\nAnother probabilistic modeling of atom radius was given corresponding to the maximum of the radial probability function of the valence electron [14][15][16]. For a hydrogen-like atom, peak of radial probability function is exactly at Bohr radius [14][15][16]. On the other hand, expected value of radial probability function is accounted as atomic radii.

The analysis that led to this conclusion was performed using the ionic radii of 4-fold coordinated cations 37 with the ionic radius of a proton taken to be zero. The maximum passable ionic radius r max is estimated using the calculated diagonal oxygen-to-oxygen distance in the 22 tunnel (l OO = 5.01 Å) and the ionic radius for O 2-(r O = 1.21 Å). 37 r max for a 2×2 tunnel was then found to be 2×2 ( ) Å. Figure 5b illustrates the effect of the size of the cation species on the formation energy to incorporate it at an interstitial site. The ionic radius of K + is larger than r max and so the formation energy of 2×2 K i is greater than the formation energy of 2×2 Na i , as Na + is slightly smaller than r max . The distance d between the coordinated cation and the center of the 22 tunnel is shown in Figure 5c. Of the 22 interstitial cations, H + and Li + are located close to the tunnel wall, whereas Na + and K + localize near the center of the tunnel and interact more equally with the neighboring oxygen atoms. The charge-switching potential of the most positive charge-switching state for a given interstitial cation is plotted relative to the energy of the valence band maximum in Figure 5d. For example, the Na + interstitial defect has an electrochemical potential for charge-switching at 2.1 V vs. E VBM or ~0.9V vs Ag/AgCl. As the electrode is scanned past this potential, our calculations show that the interstitial Na + -induced gap states change charge state. All four interstitial cations have different charge-switching potentials resulting from their dissimilar formation energies and their interactions with the neighboring oxygen atoms in the tunnel walls, resulting in capacity differences for different cations as observed experimentally. 17,18,21,38 Na +",

From this, the energy loss rate can be calculated assuming a constant scattering cross section of ≈5 b and an average energy loss per collision of f =0.9 of the original energy (Krane, 1987). The energy loss rate is then given by:\nE = E • f x/λ (4) = E • e αx → dE dx ∝ e αx\nwhere λ is the mean free path of neutrons in the material. In this case, λ is estimated to be 5 cm, although it depends on the composition and density of the material.\n\nAs mentioned in §3.2.1, we can take this as an average over the entire meteoroid.\n\nWhile the energy loss rate may be higher for aqueous inclusions, the inclusions are so small that the neutrons will not thermalize significantly within them. That is, λ n r i , where λ n is the neutron mean-free-path (in either water or rock) and r i is the inclusion radius. With this condition satisfied, the meteoroid may be treated as homogeneous.\n\nIn order to properly evaluate the neutron average energy used in Equation 3, the energy distribution of neutrons from the NC and proton inverse beta decay must be calculated. For the proton inverse beta decay, nearly all of the excess kinetic energy is carried by the positron. For the electron anti-neutrino energies listed in Table 1, the neutron energy is roughly 200 keV (Strumia and Vissani, 2003). The produced neutrons will then penetrate the surrounding medium, including the rock and any intervening organic material, losing energy as they proceed.\n\nNearly 100% of all of the neutrons produced in the reaction network come from inverse beta decay of the proton, given that the charged-current cross section is several orders of magnitude larger than the neutral current nuclear cross sections evaluated and the H abundance in the meteoric medium is significant. Thus, we assumed average neutron energies corresponding to those emitted in charged-current reactions with hydrogen.\n\n\nResults",

Vibrational relaxation is a process that makes excited electrons lose their energies in the form of vibrational energy, whereas collisional quenching is a process that excited electrons lose their energy by colliding with quenchers which are substances that can absorb fluorescence such as oxygen, chloride ions, iodide ions and acrylamide. These two processes result in the excited electrons to relax from higher vibrational state to lower vibrational state of the same excited electronic state. Internal conversion is a process that makes excited electrons on the lowest vibrational state of the higher excited electronic state to lose their energies and goes to the highest vibrational state of the lower excited electronic state. These three processes continue until the excited electrons reach the lowest vibrational state of the lowest electronic excited state. Next, the last interval conversion from this state to the allowable vibrational state of the electronic ground state occurs in two ways: non-radiative and radiative processes. Non-radiative process is a process that the excited electrons lose their energies in the form of thermal energy, whereas radiative process is a process that the excited electrons lose their energies by emitting photon in the form of fluorescence.

Because the nickel atom has an excitation energy of only 0.025 eV to its first excited state (the least in the first row of transition elements), Ni 2 has a particularly large number of low-lying states. Full potential energy curves (PECs) of more than a dozen low-lying electronic states of Ni 2 , resulting from the atomic combinations 3 F 4 + 3 F 4 and 3 D 3 + 3 D 3 , were computed. In agreement with previous theoretical studies, we found the lowest lying states of Ni 2 to correlate with the 3 D 3 + 3 D 3 dissociation limit, and the holes in the d-subshells were in the subspace of delta orbitals (i.e., the so-dubbed δδ-states). In particular, the ground state was determined as X 1 Γ g and had spectroscopic constants: bond length (R e ) 2.26 Å, harmonic frequency (ω e ) 276.0 cm −1 , and binding energy (D e ) 1.75 eV; whereas the 1 1 Σ g + excited state (with spectroscopic constants: R e 2.26 Å, ω e 276.8 cm −1 , and D e 1.75) of the 3 D 3 + 3 D 3 dissociation channel lay at only 16.4 cm −1 (0.002 eV) above the ground state at the equilibrium geometry. Inclusion of scalar relativistic effects through the spin-free exact two component (sf-X2C) method reduced the bond lengths of both of these two states to 2.20 Å, and increased their binding energies to 1.95 eV and harmonic frequencies to 296.0 cm −1 for X 1 Γ g and 297.0 cm −1 for 1 1 Σ g + .

This indicates that both states have similar geometries. The difference between the calculated (B3LYP-D3BJ/6-311++G(d,p)) and the observed rotational constants is 0.6% or less for both the ground and excited state. This gives confidence that the calculated structures can be used to enhance the structural insight. It is important to highlight that for the excited state all three rotational constants are slightly smaller than those in the ground states. Thus, there is a small increase in the dimensions of the molecule in all directions. This is captured by the calculations and consistent with the expansion of the aromatic ring associated with the pp* transition. 15 For a rigid planar structure, the inertial defect is zero, thus it serves as a measure of a molecule's planarity. The inertial defect of the excited state (À22.02(6) amu Å 2 ) is slightly smaller than that of the ground state (À23.03(4) amu Å 2 ). The main change stems from the flattening of the 5-membered ring.\n\nHigh-resolution, rotationally-resolved electronic spectroscopy can be used to track the changes in rotational constants with vibrational excitation in the excited state. 29,30 Previous studies of the vibronic spectroscopy of 1-indanol have shown that the low-frequency vibrations are sensitive to the conformation of the molecule. 7 In the REMPI spectrum in Fig. 3a, a prominent band appears at +116 cm À1 above the electronic origin of eq1.

In honour of professor Alexander Jablonski, this type of energy diagrams is often called the Jablonski diagram. It qualitatively represents electronic energy levels as bolded horizontal lines and vibrational energy levels as a stack of horizontal lines in vertical energy diagram. Straight and wavy vertical arrows represent transitions between the states, where straight arrow represents transition associated with photon, while wavy arrows represent non-radiative transfers. A radiative decay process is a process in which electron releases some of its excitation energy as photon, while in a nonradiative decay excess energy is transferred into thermal motions, as vibration, rotation and translation processes, heat. Once an electron is excited through very quick process of absorption of photon, into, for example, some vibronic state of second excited singlet state, there are several ways that energy may be dissipated. The first is through vibrational relaxation, a non-radiative process that lowers energy of electron to the lowest excited singlet state, with or without non-radiative internal conversion process, depending on the overlap of vibrational and electronic energy of different states. Next, a radiative process of energy transfer to ground singlet state is followed by emission of photons in terms of fluorescence. There is no change in multiplicity S 1 →S 0 , so the transition is spin allowed and consequently fast. Since there are a large number of vibrational levels in electronic states, transitions can result in a range of emitted wavelengths. There is also a probability of non-radiative relaxations between  the singlet states (S 1 ⤳S 0 ). If in the process of dissipating of energy spin multiplicity changes by slower process of intersystem crossing, energy can be radiatively emitted from lowest excited triplet state to ground singlet state by phosphorescence T 1 →S 0 , or non-radiatively by relaxations between the triplet and singlet states (T 1 ⤳S 0 ). Intersystem crossing and therefore phosphorescence are spin-forbidden processes; nevertheless, by coupling vibrational factors into the selection rules transitions become partially allowed, and they are consequently much slower.\n\n\nSynthesis of rare earth-doped anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles",

The following processes occur in the same manners as described in the previous paragraph.

The origin of the diffuse vibrational structure for the lowest-lying absorption band of CO 2 is more complex and related to six overlapping excited states and their collective contributions to the indirect photodissociation dynamics. Following assignments that have been presented in the literature 36 , in our recorded spectral range (1455-2000 Å) near the peak, the transition 1 1 A′ → 2 1 A′ contributes~90% to the overall spectral intensity, complemented somewhat by the 1 1 A′ → 1 1 A″ transition. The latter gradually contributes more with increasing wavelength and shows equivalent contribution to the 1 1 A′ → 2 1 A′ transition at 2000 Å. However, at this wavelength our recorded extinction is near zero. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity we limit our discussion to pressure effects arising just from the 1 1 A′ → 2 1 A′ transition. Considering that we cannot observe sub-nanometer spectral structure due to our limited spectral resolution, we cannot discuss how pressure affects the low-energy part of the spectrum where the ground-state 1 1 A′ and excited-state 2 1 A′ mix in their respective manifolds of vibrational states (near 100°bending angle, in the vicinity of the CI) 36 .

We demonstrated how photobleaching changes the spatial distribution of photon emission, producing a \"dark hole\" in the focus: the simulation results revealed that as more and more laser pulses hit the sample and photobleaching progresses, the most photons are not emitted from the focus but from an ellipsoid situated around the focus. Increased laser power, higher photobleaching cross-section, as well as longer illumination can produce this \"dark hole.\" On the other hand, diffusion can inhibit this phenomenon.

The excitation energies and oscillator strengths calculated with the two TD-DFT methods (TD-B3LYP and TD-ωB97X-D) and the ADC(2) method (all at the geometry constructed from the B3LYP/def2-TZVP monomer geometry) are listed in Table 3. We see that the three methods predict different spectra, in particular the bright transition is S 0 → S 9 at the TD-B3LYP level, S 0 → S 4 at the TD-ωB97X-D level, and S 0 → S 6 at the ADC(2) level. At the same time, all three methods predict a blue shift of the bright transition in comparison to the monomer, as expected based on the Kasha theory [22] (compare Tables 1-3). This shift is 0.14 eV for TD-DFT and 0.05 eV for ADC (2). To make a connection to experimental studies, we note that blue shifts of about 0.1 eV have been observed upon micellization of azobenzene-functionalized surfactants [5], and blue shifts of about 0.6 eV have been found in azobenzene-containing self-assembled monolayers [3].

The dimer geometry is constructed from the B3LYP/def2-TZVP optimized monomer geometry. The brightest transitions are shown in bold. The dominant NTOs for the ten lowest transitions are shown in Figure 5. First of all, it is seen that each NTO is delocalized over dimer.

Luminescence arises when certain transitions (called spontaneous radiative transitions) of these species from the states with higher energy to the states with lower energy, including the ground state, take place. Depending on the excitation method, different types of luminescence are differentiated. Thus, photoluminescence occurs upon excitation by an optical radiation (usually in UV range), electroluminescence-when excited by an electrical field. The processes that accompany the luminescence are often visualized in Jablonski diagrams (Figure 1). Absorption of light occurs in a very short femtosecond timeframe and correspond to the excitation of the particle from the ground state (S0) to an excited state (S1, S2, …). It should be noted that each state has its own set of vibrational levels, which are populated upon excitation with different probabilities and when combined, form an absorption spectrum. After the absorption of a photon, the most probable process is called the internal conversion or vibrational relaxation. This process is longer that the excitation (picosecond timeframe) and is accompanied by a structural relaxation of the excited molecule. The excess energy is converted into heat and the relaxation is thus a nonradiative process. The molecule can exist in this excited state for nanosecond and longer and then returns to the ground state, emitting a photon in a process called fluorescence. Other events that can occur after the excitation include non-radiative relaxation upon collision of the excited molecule with other particles or intersystem crossing to the lowest excited triplet state (T1). Relaxation from the triplet state to the ground state with photon emission is called phosphorescence. Transition back to the S1 state is also possible, followed by a delayed fluorescence. Coordination polymers are complex systems consisting of metal ions, one or more ligand types, inclusion of solvent molecules or other guests in voids is also possible. Emission of light by the coordination polymers can arise from various types of electron transitions-intraligand (ligandcentered), metal-centered, metal-to-ligand and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (MLCT and LMCT), Figure 1. Electron transitions in guest molecules encapsulated in the pores of the coordination polymers can also influence their photophysical properties.",

They typically contain relatively few atoms, ranging from about 1000 to 100 000. 3 This means that the crystals are large enough to be useful in the laboratory but small enough to exhibit quantum behaviours associated with individual atoms. Movement of electrons is confined in all three directions so tightly that QDs are said to be \"zero-dimensional\". As a result, changing the size of a QD controls how it absorbs and emits energy. This behaviour makes them appealing for a wide range of photonic and electronic applications. A quantum well is a sandwich of thin, stacked slices of semiconductor materials with different bandgaps. The bandgap is the energy required for an electron to jump from one energy level to another. 3 In a quantum well, the central layer has the smallest bandgap, which means that the larger gaps of the outer layers act like barriers, restricting the electrons in the middle one. This structure vertically confines the energy levels of the middle layer in one dimension. By controlling the size of that layer, scientists realized in the 1970s that they could tune the wavelengths-corresponding to colour-of photons emitted by the electrons. When a QD is provided with energy (i.e. it is in an excited state) the electron is boosted to a higher energy level, generating an exciton. When the electron returns to a lower level, the atom emits a photon of light with the same energy that the atom originally absorbed. The biggest QDs produce the longest wavelengths/lowest frequencies, while the smallest QDs make shorter wavelengths/higher frequencies. This indicates that big dots make red light and small dots make blue light, with intermediate-sized dots producing green light (and the familiar spectrum of other colours too). This effect is due to the bandgap size: a small dot has a bigger bandgap (the minimum energy it takes to free electrons so they will carry electricity through a material), so it takes more energy to excite it; because the frequency of emitted light is proportional to the energy, smaller dots with higher energy produce higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. Larger dots have more (and more closely) spaced energy levels, so they give out lower frequencies and therefore longer wavelengths. 19 QDs as a group of materials can have many differing structures and properties based on each component (Fig. 2). 20 They vary in their core and shell composition, in their size and",

Harmonic frequencies (DFT/PBE0/aug-cc-pVDZ) for the neutral electronic ground-state (Table S3) and the cationic electronic ground-state (Table S4) have also been obtained, although the neutral electronic first excited-state does not show any stable structure due to fast C-Cl bond excision (see Section 3.1).",

For ESI and crystallographic data in CIF or other electronic format see DOI: 10.1039/c5sc01945aIntroduction\n\nKasha's rule is an ubiquitously accepted fundamental principle in photophysics and photochemistry. 1 Any validation and demonstrations of its characteristic exceptions are important tools in understanding the mechanisms of excited-state reactions. This rule states that condensed-phase photoluminescence (uorescence or phosphorescence) occurs with appreciable yield only from the lowest excited state of a given multiplicity (singlet S 1 or triplet T 1 ). 2 Depending on the energy of the photon absorbed, a molecule residing in its electronic ground singlet state (S 0 ) may be excited to any set of higher energy electronic states (denoted S n where n > 1) and the corresponding photoluminescence should proceed only from the lowest lying excited state (S 1 ) of the vibrationally relaxed molecules. A similar result should be observed for the triplet manifold (T n ) when emitting phosphorescence is from the T 1 state. Thus, in a steady-state manner, any appreciable emission proceeds from the lowest excited energy states, being independent of the excitation energy/ wavelength. The physical background behind this rule is the very rapid internal conversion (IC) and environment (such as solvent) coupled vibrational relaxation from the higher-energy states S n or T n to S 1 or T 1 , which are much faster than the rates of radiative or other, non-radiative depopulation of these states.",

Cross sections are computed for photons with wavelengths starting at 500 Å up to at most 50,000 Å in 1 Å increments, typically stopping at the relevant threshold. A smaller wavelength step size is used near thresholds to resolve appropriate resonances. In Figure 3, a comparison of the state-resolved cross sections from the ground rovibrational level v″, J″=0, 0 for each transition is shown. The 2 1 Π and A′ 1 Σ + (2 1 Σ + ) transitions have the dominant cross sections from the ground rovibrational level, while the transition to the A 1 Π state makes very little contribution. The behavior of the current cross sections are significantly different from those adopted in Heays et al. (2017).\n\nPredissociation is possible following bound-bound transitions to the B 1 Σ + , 3 1 Π, and 4 1 Π states. Estimates of predissociation cross sections are computed for transitions to a wide range of bound rovibrational levels. Cross sections for transitions from v″, J″=0, 0 are shown in Figure 3 computed using Equation (9). We find that the line cross sections due to predissociation are much smaller than the direct cross sections for the 4 1 Π state. However, while predissociation through the B 1 Σ + and 3 1 Π states give cross sections comparable to those of their direct continuum cross sections, the continuum cross section for the 2 1 Π dominates the predissociation lines by more than an order of magnitude over the relevant wavelength range. Predissociation does not appear to be important for the photodestruction of CS and is therefore not considered further.",

The wave functions and other necessary functions are represented on a real space regular grid; a squared (linear for one-dimensional TDDFT) box of size L = 200 a.u. and spacing ∆x = 0.2 a.u. has been employed in all the calculations. In order to illustrate how an external field can modify the optical properties of a system in Fig. 2 we show a scan of the non-equilibrium absorption spectrum generated by a 45 cycle sin 2 envelope pulse with intensity I = 5.26 × It can be seen how the absorption around the first excitation frequency 0.533 a.u. is strongly diminished when the frequency of the pump resonates with that frequency. In that situation, an absorption peak also appears around the excitation frequency corresponding to the transition from the first to the second excited state, in our case at 0.076 a.u. This behavior is a direct consequence of the fact that the laser is pumping the system to the first excited state and this process is more efficient for a field tuned with the excitation energy. The absorption spectrum is therefore a mixture of the one corresponding to the unperturbed ground state and that of the first excited state. In order to analyze this point further, a cut at the resonant frequency is displayed in the lower (blue) curves of Fig. 3. The filled curve represents the spectrum obtained from the system in its ground state while the solid line corresponds to the spectra of the system excited by a laser pulse with a frequency resonant with the first optical transition and probed after the perturbation. By direct comparison of the two spectra it is easy to discriminate the peaks associated with the ground-state absorption from the ones characterizing the absorption from the excited state. In particular, the peaks related to the ground-state absorption are located at the energies ω 0→1 = 1 − 0 = 0.533 a.u. corresponding to the transition from the ground ( 0 = −2.238 a.u.) to the first excited state ( 1 = −1.705) and ω 0→3 = 3 − 0 = 0.672 a.u. corresponding to the third excited state",

All the respective neon lines both atomic and ionic are present. But the VUV part of the spectrum is dominated by carbon's neutral, singly and doubly charged CI, CII and CIII lines. InFigure 6bthe emission lines = 1931 Å and = 2478 Å are the two dominant VUV lines of CI that can be seen along with the = 2 135 Å and = 2191 Å of CII and the = 2297 Å of CIII. Also present is CII's 233 nm intercombination multiplet. It has very small transition probabilities ~0.1 s -1 for all five lines of the multiplet. This multiplet is generally a weak intersystem transition route for the de-excitation of CII in carbon plasmas. From the energy level scheme of C in NIST Database [18], out of the total of 254 CII emission lines between 0−2000 Å, 73 lines are emitted by de-excitation to the first excited level 2s2p 2 4 P (1/2;3/2;5/2) of CII. This level, in turn de-excites to the ground level 2 P (1/2;3/2) by the emission of the 232 nm multiplet. The intense emission indicates that CII exists as a highly excited C ion in the discharge. The NeI lines between 580−650 nm remain as the significant emission feature of all of these spectra. Singly ionized carbon's first excited state 4 P (1/2;3/2;5/2) has lifetime τ ≈4.7 ms. Thus its level density serves as a useful indicator of the carbon content of the cusp field, graphite hollow cathode plasma.

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M .

Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O.

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs.

Solvent effects\n\nThe most direct interpretation of the pressure dependence is that the nitrogen wavefunction is modified by compression of the cage. However, for some dissolved radicals, the hyperfine coupling constant depends on the solvent due to interactions between the solvent molecules and the unpaired electrons of the radical. [30][31][32][33][34] For N@C 60 , such an effect should be small, since the fullerene cage effectively isolates the atomic nitrogen from the environment. 35 However, changes in the electronic properties of the solvent could plausibly alter the electronic properties of the fullerene cage; considering Eq. 2, this would correspond to altering k. Therefore, we must exclude the possibility that the pressure-dependent hyperfine coupling reflects changes in solvent properties, such as dielectric constant ǫ r or molecular electric dipole moment µ, that are known to vary with pressure. 22,23 At room temperature and atmospheric pressure, toluene has dielectric constant ǫ r = 2.39 and dipole moment µ = 0.36 D. At 0.25 GPa, ǫ r increases to ∼2.6, while µ is likely to vary by less than 2%. To measure the effect of changes in ǫ r and µ, we therefore compare the spectrum of 15 N@C 60 dissolved in toluene with those of 15 N@C 60 dissolved in chlorobenzene (ǫ r = 5.69 and µ = 1.69 D) and carbon disulfide (ǫ r = 2.63 and µ = 0 D). The ESR spectra of 15 N@C 60 dissolved in these solvents were measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure at the X band using a Bruker ER4122-SHQE-W1 resonator and EMXmicro spectrometer.

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data.

At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section.

This scheme works quite well for stable tightly bound nuclei but may become a poor approximation for exotic nuclei that nowadays are extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. An improvement of the structureless nucleus model, at a first step, consists in explicitly considering also its lowest excited states (A * ), thereby accounting for the compositeness of the nucleus A in an approximate way. This extension has been proposed long ago [1] and applied to numerous studies of elastic and inelastic N + A scattering. However, the application of interaction models including the excitation of the involved nucleus, also called the core excitation, to threebody nuclear reactions, e.g., deuteron (d) stripping and pickup, is still a complicated task. First studies of (d, p) reactions demonstrating the importance of the core exci- tation [2][3][4][5] were based on two-body-like approaches such as the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) and coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) that relied on deuteron-nucleus optical potentials. Only quite recently the three-body calculations have emerged that include the core excitation. Extensions of the DWBA [6,7] and continuum discretized coupled channels (CDCC) method [8,9] mostly focused on the breakup reactions, in particular, of 11 Be. The calculations for neutron transfer reactions 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be and 11 Be(p, d) 10 Be were performed using rigorous Faddeev three-body scattering theory [10] in the form of Alt, Grassberger, and Sandhas (AGS) equations [11] for transition operators, solved in the extended Hilbert space [12][13][14]. The latter works demonstrated that in the deuteron stripping and pickup the core excitation effect cannot be simply simulated by the reduction of the cross section according to the respective spectroscopic factor (SF). It was found that extracting the SF from the ratio of experimental and theoretical transfer cross sections, as often used with the adiabatic distorted wave approximation (ADWA) calculations [15], may lead to a strong underestimation of the SF. Calculations of Refs. [12][13][14] employed the rotational model [1] for the excitation of the 10 Be",

[16] relying on the factorization conjecture. Thus, the dynamical core excitation model well explains a stronger reduction of the cross section observed in Ref. [16] as compared to the factorization conjecture. The deviation between the two curves in Fig. 4 increases with increasing energy, and their ratio becomes angle-dependent, thereby indicating that the factorization conjecture fails at higher energies. The reduction of the cross section at forward angles is significantly stronger than SF, e.g., R x = 0.59 at E d = 63 MeV and Θ c.m. = 0 • . Such a behavior is indeed qualitatively consistent with findings of Refs. [12][13][14] Fig. 5. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are again close, especially at forward angles. Thus, despite that SF = 0.34 significantly deviates from unity, the differential cross section including the core excitation scales well with SF, and at this energy the factorization conjecture is valid. However, the situation changes dramatically at higher energy where the two curves deviate  In Figs. 4 and 5 we also isolate the E3BF core-excitation effect, given as the difference between the solid and dashdotted curves. Quite surprisingly, even at E d = 21 MeV it turns out to be significant. Consequently, the coreexcitation effect of the two-body nature must be significant as well to cancel the E3BF to a large extent, especially at E d = 21 MeV, such that their sum reproduces the full core-excitation effect. We note that substantial cancellation of the corresponding two-and three-body effects due to the ∆-isobar excitation was often observed also in the nucleon-deuteron scattering [18].",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

                    "contents": "Multiconfiguration Pair-Density Functional Theory.An MCSCF wave function can eliminate static correlation error without breaking spin symmetry; for example, by employing two CSFs one can eliminate the error in the description of H 2 at the dissociation asymptote, where the correction to the restricted Hartree-Fock result is called static correlation error. Dynamic correlation energy is the total correlation energy (which is defined as the difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy) minus the static correlation energy. For an MCSCF calculation to provide a good reference function, it should include enough configurations to capture the static correlation energy. Inevitably then, it also recovers some dynamic correlation energy. We can illustrate this by considering H 2 at its equilibrium internuclear distance. There is only one low-energy CSF for this geometry, so there is no static correlation error and no static correlation energy. Thus, the energy difference between the two-CSF energy and the Hartree-Fock energy is purely dynamic correlation energy at this geometry, although two configurations are not enough to converge the dynamic correlation energy.\n\nA useful way to discuss correlation energy in the context of MCSCF and post-MCSCF calculations is to divide correlation energy into internal and external components. Internal correlation energy is the energy included in the MCSCF calculation, and external correlation energy is the rest of the correlation energy. The previous paragraph illustrated how internal correlation energy may be static or dynamic or a combination of the two. For a general MR system, the MCSCF energy has both static and dynamic contributions, but including enough configurations in an MCSCF calculation to converge the correlation energy is impractical. Therefore, for quantitatively accurate results, the MCSCF wave function is used as a reference function for a subsequent post-SCF calculation, such as XMS-CASPT2 or XMC-QDPT (extended multiconfigurational quasidegenerate perturbation theory). It could also be a reference for a larger CI calculation or for a coupled-cluster-like calculation. This review is about using the MCSCF wave function as a reference function for a subsequent post-SCF pair-density functional calculation. Note that when we talk about functionals of the pair density, they are always also functionals of the total electron density.",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14].

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

There are two approaches in SAC-CI for studying the inner-shell electronic processes. One is based on the general-R method [7,8] in which the neutral ground-state Hartree-Fock wave function is adopted for the reference function. The wave function for core ionization, for example, is given by,\nexp SAC CI a ab abc general R i ij ijk ijkl I HF i ija ijkab ijklabc I R R R R S                            ,(7)\nwhere R and S represent the R-and S-operators in the SAC-CI expansion, respectively, and HF  is the closed-shell ground-state Hartree-Fock wave function. In this method, the higher R-operators such as triples and quadruples are necessary for describing both orbital relaxation and electron correlations of the core-electronic processes. Although the SD-R method is accurate for the one-electron processes of the valence excitations and ionizations, higher-order operators are indispensable for the core- electronic processes. For example, for calculating the core-electron binding energy, R-operators up to triples are necessary and for the shake-up satellite states, SDTQ-R calculations are required. Thus, this method is simple and accurate; however, its computational cost is relatively high because it usually includes higher operators for accurate calculations. This method is applicable to the general coreelectronic processes. The other approach is the open-shell reference (OR) SAC-CI method, in which the core-ionized ROHF is used for the reference. Because the OR-SAC-CI method starts from the core-hole state, the method is efficient and accurate. However, it introduces a complex expansion because of the deexcitation operators. For example, it is difficult to calculate the g-u splitting accurately because it starts from different reference functions for the g and u states.",

As a starting point a Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation was performed for 4s4p 3 P o . The HF calculation was followed by a sequence of calculations describing valence-valence and core-valence electron correlation effects. The CSF expansions for these calculations were obtained by allowing single (S) and double (D) substitutions from 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 3d 10 4s4p 3 P o to increasing active sets of orbitals with the restriction that there is at most one substitution from the core shells. The 1s-shell is kept closed in all calculations. These expansions are referred to as all singles and restricted doubles (SrD) expansions. The active sets are denoted by giving the highest orbital of each symmetry. For example, {5s5p4d4f } denotes the orbital set that includes the orbitals 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 2p, 3p, 4p, 5p, 3d, 4d, 4f . In the MCHF calculations the HF orbitals were kept frozen and the remaining orbitals were optimized together. The MCHF calculations were followed by a CI calculation based on the largest orbital set. The CI calculation describes valence-valence (VV), core-valence (CV) and core-core (CC) correlation effects and includes CSFs obtained by all single and double (SD) substitutions. Whereas SD expansions describe the major corrections to the wave function, it is known that CSFs obtained from triple (T) substitutions are important for hyperfine structures [31]. The effects of the T substitutions were accounted for in CI, by augmenting the largest SD expansion with expansions obtained by T substitutions to increasing orbital sets. All calculations are summarized in Table I. To correct for the relativistic contraction due to the mass variation, Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) calculations were also performed and the final SD+T values were multiplied with the DHF/HF ratio. This correction will be discussed in more detail in the next section. From Table I we see that valence-valence and core-valence effects, as described by SrD expansions, increase the absolute values",

Based on Hartree-Fock orbitals, a full-valence space active space with 5 spatial orbitals and 4 electrons was chosen, yielding the CASCI(5o,4e) curve.This corresponds to k = 10 active spin-orbitals and with the frozen-core approximation (the 1s-orbital of B is frozen) the full number of spin-orbitals is K = 20.Considering this relatively small system allows us to do a Full-CI calculation as an exact reference (red curve).The green curve shows how the MRPT2 correction improves the active space calculation by including contributions from the virtual orbitals.In fact it recovers about two thirds of the missing correlation energy of CASCI(5o,4e) compared to the frozen core Full-CI result, and as seen in Table I, the error in the dissociation energy D e is reduced from 3.1 mH to 0.8 mH.Despite the relatively small size of the basis set, this result highlights an important fact: To achieve 'chemical accuracy' (1.6 mH) it is necessary to go beyond the active space approximation and take into account dynamical correlation effects.\n\nFurthermore, to investigate the effect of the MRPT2 correction on a larger chemical system with a barrier, we considered the interconversion reaction from oxywater (H 2 OO) to hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) via a transition state (TS).This system has sparked interest among theoretical chemists in the 1990s, because it was debated whether oxywater was a stable minimum on the potential energy surface or not [56,57].Starting from a restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) calculation in the def2-TZVP basis set, we optimized the geometries of H   spatial orbitals with and without the MRPT2 correction (orange and green, respectively) and Full-CI with frozen core electrons.Upper: absolute energies, lower: energies differences with respect to the Full-CI frozen core energies.",

A high temperature line list for phosphorus nitrideWe considered a simple one-parameter semi-empirical modification of PEC-A as a way of improving its quality in a physically motivated way and with a view to provide a reasonable behaviour in the high energy range, experimentally unexplored. In particular, we investigated simple scalings of the Davidson correction contribution to the energies. The ab initio MRCI+Q energies can be broken down into a sum of three contributions: EMRCI+Q = ECASSCF + Ecorr + E+Q, where ECASSCF is the energy of the reference CASSCF wave function, Ecorr = EMRCI − ECASSCF is the MRCI correlation energy and E+Q is the renormalized Davidson correction, which is given by E+Q = Ecorr(1 − c 2 0 )/c 2 0 where c0 is the expansion coefficient of the CASSCF wave function in the MRCI one (Szalay et al. 2012). The Davidson correction tries to approximate the effect of quadruple excitations neglected in the MRCI calculation; in our calculation the c0 expansion coefficient as a function of r has the value 0.966 for the near-equilibrium geometry r = 1.50Å, then decreases linearly up to about r = 2.0Å, assumes a minimum value 0.963 at r = 2.30Å and then slowly grows up to a dissociation value of 0.965. The small variation of c0 with geometry and the fact c0 ≈ 1 show that the CASSCF wave function is indeed a good reference function for all geometries. By contrast the expansion coefficient of the Hartree-Fock reference in the MRCI expansions is 0.91 at r = 1.50Å and then decreses monotonically, is 0.5 at r = 2.56Å and has an asymptotic value of about 0.28. Eventually we chose a simple direct scaling of the Davidson correction part of PEC-A by a factor α = 1.835. The optimal value of α was found by fitting the experimental J = 0 vibrational levels for v = 0-11 reported in Table 2. Equivalently, PEC-S can be written as VS(r) = VA(r) + 0.835 E+Q(r), where",

To this end, we generated a sample in which all peptides are labeled with the identical 1:1 ratio. We observe that the ratio of the signals in two channels of the mass spec instrument converges to an asymptotic value, just like the fractional outcome of a sequence of coin-tosses converges to a true ratio with the number of tosses. Figure 2A presents a scatter plot where each point represents a single peptide from a dataset of a total of 10534 peptides. The functional form of this dependency for a coin toss represented by a Binomial distribution for the\ncoefficient of variation is √(1 − )/\n, where p is the ratio and n the number of coin-tosses. In order to treat the MS-signal as an outcome of a binomial process, we need to find a conversion factor from a continuous MS-signal into equivalents of \"coin flips\". We fit a single parameter m as a multiplier to an MS-signal s where n = ms to the binned data (Fig. 2B). When we perform this analysis on an Orbitrap Lumos with 50K mass resolution, we observe a convertion factor of 2.0. When we performed the equivalent experiments on different instruments and resolutions, we observed different values (Table 1). Makarov et al. previously reported that this conversion factor should scale inversely with the square-root of the Orbitrap resolution (Makarov and Denisov, 2009). Our measurements are in rough agreement with this prediction; when we increase resolution from 15K to 120K on the Lumos we expect the conversion factor to reduce by 2.8-fold, we observe a 3.5 decrease. Based on previous reports by the same paper, we likely underestimate the number of actual ions by a small factor. Nevertheless, the good fit to the data (Fig. 2B) indicates that the conversion into pseudo-counts allows us to model the relationship between mass spectrometer signal and measurement noise due to ion-statistics and other noise occurring during data acquisition. For a limited number of cases, we have repeated these measurements for various instruments of the same model and obtained very similar results suggesting that for a given instrument model and resolution the conversion factors are invariant.",

The similarity among the components determines the property similarity of the microstates in equation 1. Intuitively we may understand that, the values of the probability p i are related to each other and therefore depend solely on the similarity of the considered property X among the microstates. If the values of the component property are more similar, the values of p i of the microstates are closer (equation 1 and 2). The similarity among the microstates is reflected in the similarity of the values of p i we may observe. There might be many different methods of similarity definition and calculation. However, entropy should be always a monotonically increasing function of any kind of similarity of the relevant property if that similarity is properly defined.\n\nExample 9. Suppose a coin is placed in a container and shaken violently. After opening the container you may find that it is either head-up or head-down (The portrait on the coin is the label). For a bent coin, however, the property of head-up and the probability of head-down will be different. The entropy will be smaller and the symmetry (shape of the coin) will be reduced. In combination with example 2, it is easy to understand that entropy and similarity increase together. Now, let us perform the following proof: the Gibbs inequality, =1 lnln w ii i wpp ≥− ∑ (18) has been proved in geometry (see the citations in [7d]). As ln w represents the maximum similarity among the considered w microstates [18], the general expression of entropy =1 ln w ii i pp − ∑ must increase continuously with the increase in the property similarity among the w microstates. The maximum value of ln w in equation 2 corresponds to the highest similarity. Finally, based on the second law of the revised information theory regarding structural stability that says that the entropy of an isolated system (or system + environment) either remains unchanged or increases, the similarity principle has been proved.",

However, the probability of such an event is extremely low. The probability of being in a certain state is dependent on the number of ways to reach that state. This is called the multiplicity of a state, and is denoted by Ω (omega).

Number of Wyckoff sequences of a given subdivision complexityA generating polynomial approach to find solutions\n\nOur combinatorial problem stated above is solved in two steps: first, by reducing it, conceptually, to an analogous classical problem of combinatorics, the coin change problem, as can be found in many textbooks on the topic (for instance, Marcus, 1998, p. 89), and second, by adapting the classical problem to the crystallographic one.\n\nThe classical coin change problem is stated in Appendix B, and can be seen as an illustration of the use of generating polynomials, defined in some abstract variable. Notably, the variable is an indeterminate symbol only, entailing no specific meaning other than to allow algebraic operations performed on it; hence it merely acts as a placeholder and bookkeeping device, yet is the decisive one, in order to systematically find a solution.\n\nThis use of generating polynomials has already been described in the first entry of this series (Hornfeck, 2022a) to which the reader, interested in more detailed information, is referred. An introduction to the wider field of generating functions is given by Graham et al. (1994), and a more detailed exposition of the main ideas involved is given by Wilf (2006). Now, adapting the classical coin change problem to our crystallographic one is carried out in three steps: (i) matching the number of distinct types of coins with the number of distinct Wyckoff positions; (ii) identifying the values of distinct types of coins with the pair of values of the Wyckoff position's multiplicity M i and arity A i ; and (iii) treating the pair of values (M i , A i ) in a coupled way, by introducing two abstract variables ðx; yÞ in the generating polynomials, instead of one.\n\nThus, in some way, the crystallographic problem is a coin change problem with a twist, based on imaginary coins with denominations on both their front and back sides and a pair of target values to reach upon summation. Similar combinatorial problems arise for the case of real cards, coupling values denoted by digits or letters with symbolic ones such as diamonds, hearts, spades and clubs.",

It has numerous benefits over labeled reduction. One is that it satisfies the diamond property (and can be used for proving confluence of labeled reduction and the λ w -calculus (Prop. 4.3.6)). Another is that we can avoid reasoning over reduction to a normal form: one simultaneous reduction step suffices for superdeveloping a term. A naive attempt at formalizing this notion in big-step style fails. Let us write M S ⇒ N for such a judgement, where S is a sequence of variables which denotes the binding context (i.e. the variables that are bound in the context) in which this superdevelopment takes place. This judgement would include the inference scheme:\nM S ⇒ λ x.M ′ N S ⇒ N ′ (λ x.M ′ ) N ′ ↑ S M N S ⇒ M ′ {x := N ′ }(1)\nHowever, it turns out that we need to consider an exception to the condition (λ x.M ′ ) N ′ ↑ S, namely when an abstraction contributes to a head redex in a superdevelopment. Indeed, in this case the abstracted variable is to be substituted and hence redexes which contain occurrences of this variable can be contracted. As an example, consider the following superdevelopment in the λ w -calculus:\nI (λ x.I x) y → (λ x.I x) y → I y → y\nTo deduce the judgement I (λ x.I x) y S ⇒ y using (1) we require I (λ x.I x) S ⇒ λ x.x. For this to hold we must allow contraction of I x. As a consequence, we study an extended judgement M S,k ⇒ N in which the integer k ≥ 0 indicates how many abstractions of M contribute to a head redex in a later stage of the derivation. Reduction under these abstractions is allowed. Note that, in contrast to Sec. 3.1 where S in A S → ℓ B includes all the variables in A bound above the redex that is reduced, in the judgement M S,k ⇒ N the sequence S contains only the variables in M bound above the redexes of the superdevelopment under which reduction is not allowed.",

For a given CME (1), find the lower and the upper bounds of the mean and the variance of molecular copy number x at steady state.\n\nTo solve this problem, let dm α /dt = 0 in the equation (6), and consider the subset of linear equations by limiting the equations up to the µ-th order moments.

When deg(w i (x)) = 0 or 1, the number of equations is the same as the number of variables (see (8)), and thus we can compute the unique solution (if the equations are not degenerated). In the more general case where the transition rates w i (x) are quadratic, the right-hand side of (10) depends on the higher order moments, i.e., deg(m β ) = µ + 1, as shown in (9) Consequently, the equations become underdetermined, and we can only conclude that the solution lies on a certain hyperplane unless we consider an infinite number of equations.\n\nTo further specify the solution space of the moments m β , we utilize the fact that m β must be the moments of some (probability) measure defined on the positive orthant. In particular, we use a so-called moment condition to constrain m β and formulate a semidefinite program solving Problem 1.",

Let n w be the number of water molecules in a shell for some chosen configuration. The potential energy of these n w waters is given by the interaction energy between these n w waters plus half the interaction energy of these n w waters with the rest of the fluid. We thus find the average potential energy, E shell , and the average population, n shell , for a given shell. The contribution to the average reorganization energy from the shell is then E shell − n shell · ε w . Errors are propagated using standard rules.\n\nFor all cases, we find that by the third shell bulk behavior is attained; that is, E reorg,3 ≈ 0 within statistical uncertainties, where E reorg,3 is the reorganization energy contribution from the third (3 rd ) shell. The slight difference in the average counts versus R g and average counts versus r (Fig. 3) occurs because the relation between r and R g is itself subject to some statistical uncertainty.\n\nThus sorting configurations using r or R g as order parameters can influence the averaging of the dependent variable (here the number of hydrogen bonds).

Here, i is the index of vertices of the graph, and N is the total number of vertices. W i j is the transition rate from state j to i. Here, the transition from a vertex to itself is usually prohibited, i.e., W i i = 0. By assuming W i j > 0 for i = j, the reversible Markov chain can be represented by a complete graph. We label the edges by running variable m, and determine the orientation of each edge arbitrary. Let B be the incidence matrix of the oriented graph. We define functions h(m) and t(m) that return the index of head and tail vertices of the mth oriented edge, respectively. Then, Eq. 96 can be mapped to a chemical rate equation (Eq. 1) by defining\nx i = p i , Y = I, S = −Y B, and j + m (x) = W t(m) h(m) x h(m) ,(97)j − m (x) = W h(m) t(m) x t(m) .(98)\nAll fluxes are linear in this case. Because the graph is fully connected, B has the unique left null vector 1 as 1 T B = 0.

The stoichiometric polytope is nothing but the N − 1 dimensional simplex of probability distributions if we fix η = 1.

In this case, B has the unique left null vector 1 as well.\n\nThe detailed balance condition of Eq. 96 is typically defined as W i j π j = W j i π i for all i and j.",

With this in mind we explored how the presence of chemisorbed hydrogens impact the proton penetration barrier of graphene. Adsorbed hydrogens are examined since when they chemisorb they lead to an sp 2 to sp 3 hybridisation of the carbon atoms they are bonded to but also because the hydrogenation of graphene is facile [43]. A broad range of hydrogenation scenarios was considered ranging from having just a single chemisorbed hydrogen at a proton penetration site to fully hydrogenated graphene (graphane) sheets. Examples of some of the structures considered are shown in Fig. 3, with full details given in the SI [44]. Upon computing the proton penetration barriers through the various hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated sheets considered, we find that hydrogenation leads to reduced proton penetration barriers. The actual barriers obtained depends sensitively on the particular hydrogenation structure, with barriers for some hydrogenated structures reduced very substantially to < 1 eV. Let us now look more closely at the hydrogenated systems and try to understand the barriers obtained. Crucially we find that the penetration of protons through a single atom layer is a local process and that the height of the penetration barrier depends primarily on the local degree of hydrogenation in the vicinity of the penetration site. To show this more clearly, we introduce an order parameter, D H local . D H local is defined as D H local = N H N +w×N H S , with N H N (N H S ) being the number of hydrogenated atoms at the nearest (second nearest) neighbors of the hole (indicated by N and S in the Fig. 3 (f)), and w representing a weight factor capturing the importance of hydrogenation at the second nearest sites. The barriers as a function of D H local , with w set to 0.5, are plotted in Fig. 3 (g) (tuning w from 0.2 to 0.8 gives similar results (Fig. S11)). Upon computing D H local for all barriers considered we found two interesting features: i) a clear correlation exists between the penetration barrier and D H local , with the barrier getting smaller as D H local inceases, and ii) the systems can be categorized into two main groups, with the most significant barrier reduction being found for D H local > 6.

Define a cut as a partition of the original set V into two subsets S and T with V = S T and S T = ∅. The aim of MaxCut is to find S maximizing the sum of edge weight connecting vertices in S and T.

He found that when swiftly-moving alpha particles are allowed to collide with gold atoms, they are sometimes deflected through 180 o , implying that a strong force is at work. This experimental phenomenon led Rutherford to propose the nuclear model of the atom in 1911. The force is just the electrostatic repulsion experienced by an alpha particle when it chances to approach close to the nucleus of a gold atom. Since the time of Rutherford physicists and chemists commonly believed that in the absence of an external field, the nucleus of an atom is at the centre of the electron cloud, so that any kind of atoms does not have permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) [1] . Therefore, there is no polar atom in nature except for polar molecules.\n\nIn the fact, the scattering experiment of alpha particles by matter only showed that there is one small nucleus, its diameter is only about one ten thousandth of the atomic diameter, and the positive charge on the nucleus is precisely cancelled out by the negative charge of the electron cloud. But the idea，the nucleus of an atom is at the centre of the electron cloud (based on the spherical symmetry of the nuclear model of the atom), is untested hypothesis. R.P. Feynman once stated that \"The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the following: The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is the sole judge of scientific 'truth' \". [1] We hope thoroughly to test the idea by precise measurement.\n\n\nHow can we separate Polar and Non-polar atoms?",

The influence of the solvent was simulated using the OPC3 water model [24]. Rectangular box and periodic boundary conditions were used in the simulation. The space between the aptamer model and the periodic box wall was at least 15 Å. Potassium ions were used to neutralize the negative charge of the DNA backbone and stabilize the quadruplex structure. The parameters needed for interatomic energy calculation were taken from the force fields OL15 [25,26]. At the beginning of computation, the aptamer models were optimized in two stages. First, the location of the solvent molecules was optimized by using 1000 steps (500 steps of steepest descent followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient). At this stage, the mobility of all solute atoms was restrained by a force constant of 500 kcal·mol −1 ·Å −2 . In the second stage, the optimization was performed without restrictions using 2500 steps (1000 steps of steepest descent and 1500 steps of conjugate gradient). Then, gradual heating to 300 K was carried out for 20 ps. To avoid spontaneous fluctuations at this point, weak harmonic restraints were applied with a force constant of 10 kcal·mol −1 ·Å −2 for all atoms other than solvent. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to constrain hydrogen-containing bonds, which allowed the use of a 2 fs time step. Scaling of 1-4 nonbonded van der Waals and electrostatic interactions was performed by using the standard Amber values. The cutoff distance for nonbonded interactions was set to 10 Å, and the long-range electrostatics were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method. MD simulations in the production phase were carried out using constant temperature (T = 300 K) and constant pressure (p = 1 atm) over 80 ns. To control the temperature, a Langevin thermostat was used with a collision frequency of 1 ps −1 . To estimate the distances between tetrads or particular guanines, the centers of mass of the aromatic rings were used. The plots of geometrical parameters and energy of interaction vs. time were smoothed using the moving average method (span = 5).\n\n\nConclusions",

The dynamic distribution of PMs throughout this process could greatly influence the efficiency of energy deposition of alpha particle irradiation [40]. The information of the exact distance of PMs to nuclei at certain time points could be of great use, considering the short path-length of alpha particles. With the use of Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) we determined the position of intracellular PMs with high precision and evaluated per nucleus the number of PMs which were in range to deposit alpha particle radiation to the nucleus. We treated PNT2C2 cells with PKH26 labeled 80 nm PMs for 2 hours, washed with PBS, fixed, and stained the nuclei with DAPI. Using 3D analysis, we drew lines between centers of nuclei and PMs ( Figure 4A and movie S6). By measuring the intensity profile of the nuclear staining on the straight lines we calculated the distance between the edge of the nucleus and all PMs in a single image. We use the drop of sirDNA signal as indication of the edge of the nucleus (Figure 4B.1). Distances between the edge of the nucleus to the PM coordinate was defined as 'distance to nucleus'. By calculating all PM to nucleus distances we generated a distance distribution ( Figure 4B.2). The histogram shows that most PMs (1008 of 1091, 92%) are within the range of the supposed alpha particle path length (<40 μm, red line, median: 17.7 µm). We conclude that many PMs can contribute to effective alpha particle irradiation of cell nuclei in a 2-D setting. To test this, the efficacy with which DNA damage could be induced could be investigated using radiolabeled PMs with alpha particle emitting radionuclides.\n\n\nBi labeled polymersomes damage nearby nuclei of U2OS cells after uptake",

The distinct streaky structures (Figure 2a and b) confirm the ordered structure of the observed particles. A fairly common distance between the bands is 2.38 ± 0.01 Å and 2.70 ± 0.03 Å. The first of them can be interpreted as the distance between atomic rows in the 111 plane in a three-layer closest packing. For platinum, it is 2.402 Å (UCP according to the ICDD base data is 3.9231 Å), the inverse calculation of UCP from the distance between the bands gives a value of 2.89 ± 0.01 Å, which, according to formula 1, corresponds to an iron content of 16 ± 5%. Another distance, probably, is the distance between the atomic rows in the coordinate planes 100 of the cubic lattice, simultaneously being the doubled interplanar distance d220 of the fcc lattice (structure type A1), although the UCP calculated from this distance is only 2.82 ± 0.04 Å. The underestimation is most likely due to the worse conditions for the arrangement of crystals with their planes parallel to the surface of the carbon film, in contrast to the more developed 111 planes in the first case. The inclined arrangement of the crystals precisely reduces the distance between the stripes in the projection onto the observation plane of the HRTEM images.\n\nIn confirmation of the validity of this, we can cite our experience of observing and evaluating with high accuracy the UCP of gold over distances in the same 111 plane [22]. The distances of 2.495 ± 0.004 Å found from HRTEM images are not any interplanar distances, as is often interpreted in relation to the bands under consideration, and coincide with the calculated 2.498 Å according to the UCP of gold (4.0786 Å according to the ICDD base data).",

However, the experimental ground state of 15 C is 1/2 + . We conjectured that this level inversion may be accounted for in terms of the SMSO and the first-order tensor force contribution[14]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the tensor correlation on the evolution of the clustering in the carbon isotopes, 15 C and 17 C. It was found that, for larger alpha-alpha distances, the repulsive effect of the first-order tensor correlation acts on the 5/2 + -state strongly, and the 1/2 + -state comes lower than the 5/2 + -state in the 15 C, with the R 1 ≥ 1.5 fm. However, such a large R 1 value does not yield the energy minimum. This indicates that other mechanisms, for example, the inclusion of the bare tensor interaction, are necessary.Summary and discussionWe studied the cluster-shell competition by introducing a simple parameterization for the alphaalpha distance in the core nucleus and for the dissolution of an alpha particle. In this way the characteristics of nuclei consisting of a few alpha particles and valence neutrons can be classified. The alpha particle is dissolved by the spin-orbit force, and the shell-model-like and cluster-model-like behaviour can be related to a dissolution parameter.In this study, only one alpha particle was allowed to dissolve. We think that is not enough to describe the system realistically, and hence, in a future work, we proceed to breaking further alpha particles in the calculations.\n.

Using the intra-molecular PRE data, a set of distance restraints was calculated and used to determine the most favourable SL conformer orientations for a single conformer or an ensemble of four conformers at each mutant position using Xplor-NIH version 2.34. 31,32 For localizing the SL orientations on CcP, only PREs from amides within 23 Å of the SL oxygen atom were used, thus eliminating the data that do not yield relevant restraints (class III PRE). When an ensemble of four SL conformers was used, r À6 ensemble averaging was done for the distances r between the four SL positions and a nucleus. The calculations were performed in two steps using side-chain dynamics, in which all atoms were fixed apart from those of the SL and the amino side chains within 10 Å of the SL. During the first step, only van der Waals (vdW) forces were considered, followed by a second step in which both the vdW forces and the distance restraints were used. The vdW forces were defined as repel forces between the SL and the protein atoms but were set to zero between multiple SLs in the ensemble. This was repeated 1000 times and the orientation of the lowest energy was used as the experimentally determined orientation in subsequent docking calculations of Cc to CcP.\n\n\nProtein docking",

Each step involves calculation of the force applied on atoms as well as its merging with the present situations and velocities to obtain the upcoming positions and velocities in the next step. The enacted force of each atom is assumed stable during this time step. As the atoms displace to new positions, a set of forces will be calculated and the process will be repeated. In this content, molecular dynamics simulation offers a path to describe the change of dynamic variables through passing of time [59].\n\n\nForce Fields\n\nExpressed as a set of mathematical equations, interatomic forces are of great significance in the accuracy and validity of simulated results. Alternation of inter-particle distances will change their interactive energies (potential energy). The potential function is presented in Equation (1); while based on Equation (2), derivation from potential function can lead to force function of each i atom in an N-atom system. These equations are simultaneously solved for short time steps. Besides that, using Equation (3), force can be assigned to the atomic position and time [59,60].",

We introduced a similar parameterization to allow for the effect of the tensor force on the wave function. Unlike for the SMSO, for the tensor case we used a real number for the geometrical shift of one spin-up proton and one spin-down neutron in opposite directions. This shift enhances the S = 1, T = 0 component, in other words, a deuteron-like component. We call this parameterization SMT (simple method to include the tensor force). By combining SMSO and SMT, we calculated the energy of some N α systems, 4 He, 8 Be, and 12 C. Since the tensor interaction in this calculation is not the bare interaction, the energy gain from the tensor part is not as large as that which can be obtained from the tensor force in an ab initio calculation with a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. A comparison of the results of SMSO-SMT calculations for 8 Be and 12 C reveals a competition between the spin-orbit and tensor forces. For 8 Be, the optimum alpha-alpha distance is large and the dissolution is small. The energy gain from the tensor force is larger than that obtained in the 4 He case. On the other hand, for 12 C, the optimum value of the alpha-alpha distance is not so large as in 8 Be, and the dissolution parameter becomes large so as to allow the spin-orbit interaction to have a larger effect. The energy gained from the tensor interaction becomes small in this case.\n\nThe cause of such a difference between 8 Be and 12 C can be attributed to the following mechanism. A small alpha-alpha distance like that in 12 C hinders the particle-hole-like excitations, which would be involved in the dissolution of the alpha particle, due to the Pauli principle. A large alpha-alpha distance, in contrast, does not suppress the particle-hole excitations. Hence, in the 8 Be case, the energy gain of the tensor interaction becomes large.\n\n\nApplication to the carbon isotopes",

In the CABS model the polypeptide chain representation is reduced to up to four unified atoms per residue (see Figure 1). These interaction centers represent lattice-confined C-alpha atoms, C-beta atoms, the united side chain pseudo-atom, and additionally, pseudo-atoms representing geometrical centers of peptide bonds needed to define the hydrogen pseudo-bond. An example of a polypeptide chain in CABS representation is presented in Figure 1b. Even though the restriction of the C-alpha trace to the underlying low spacing (0.61 Å [28]) cubic lattice may appear to be a drastic simplification, it is not. Allowing small fluctuations of the C-alpha, C-alpha distance enables hundreds of possible orientations of this pseudo bond, and thereby the resulting model chains do not show any noticeable directional biases. Furthermore, the averaged resolution of the C-alpha traces is acceptable and below 0.5 Å [28]. Additionally, the lattice representation enables pre-calculation of local moves and corresponding changes of interactions, leading to a few times faster simulations in comparison with otherwise equivalent continuous space CG models [11].\n\nThe CABS model uses a knowledge-based statistical force field that consists of generic, sequence-independent interaction terms that favor protein-like conformations, and sequencedependent interaction terms that determine some structural details [11,28,78]. The generic force field terms are derived from general features of polypeptide chains that result in protein-like behavior of the model chains. They account for properties of protein chains such as local stiffness, their biases toward secondary structures and packing compactness. The residue-residue interaction terms are derived from contact geometry statistics derived from folded globular proteins (illustrated in Figure 2a). Nevertheless, the local packing regularities in unfolded states appear to be very similar to that observed in native structures [11,28,33]. Thereby, CABS simulations provided correct pictures of protein folding [49,[52][53][54][55][56]60] and flexibility of globular proteins [70,71].",

An energy cut-off of 200 Ry was chosen to define the real space grid, necessary to represent the density and the potential and to calculate the Hamiltonian and the overlap matrix elements.

This, however, does not altogether contradict the theory, for certain assumptions used by Bohr in integrating his formula do not hold for low velocities. For instance, the formula depends on the assumption that a certain distance X[=eE(M + ™)/V2mM] exists, which is very small in comparison witĥ Velocity o f a -P articles in passing through Matter.

This assumption comes in in the consideration of the effect of the atomic forces on the motion of the electrons disturbed by an a-particle.\n\nIf we consider the variation in the velocity of an a-particle when V/V0 = 0-5, say, i.e. Y = 1*0 x 109, it can be calculated that n must be extremely small compared with 2*0 x 1018 for this assumption to hold. For oxygen, Bohr calculates from data of Planck and of Whiddington that for some electrons in the atom n = 1*1 x 1018, and that for materials of higher atomic weight electrons of much higher frequencies must exist. Thus Bohr's conditions probably do not hold for low velocities, and this possibility he has himself already pointed out.\n\nIt is interesting to note that no theoretical explanation has so far been given for Bragg's law that the absorption of a-particles per atom of different substances is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight.

These so-called fluorophores contain an aromatic system. The emission wavelength is greater than the excitation wavelength, caused by an energy loss. The process of the fluorescence is illustrated by the Jablonski diagram shown in Figure 1. A light quantum of energy hvA supplied by an external source is absorbed by the fluorophore, creating an excited electronic singlet state (S1 or S2). On these energy levels the fluorophores can exist in different vibrational energy levels (v) corresponding to the Franck-Condon-principle. From the higher vibrational level of S1 or S2 the fluorophore is rapidly relaxing to the lowest vibrational level due to internal conversion. A photon with energy hvF is emitted when the fluorophore is returning to its electronic ground state S0. The energy of this emission photon is lower, and therefore of a longer wavelength than the excitation photon. This behavior can be seen in Figure 2, where in the upper left triangle of the spectrum no fluorescence signal can be seen. This so-called Stoke's shift enables the high sensitivity of the fluorescence technique because it allows the detection of emission photons against a low background, isolated from excitation photons [62]. Characteristic features of fluorophores are the quantum yield and the lifetime. The ratio of the number of excited and emitted photons is the quantum yield, and the lifetime is defined by the average time the molecule spends in the excited state before it returns to its ground state [63]. However, the fluorescence yield can be influenced by different effects which involve energy transfer and absorption. For example, the so-called inner filter effects reduce the intensity of the fluorescence measurements when non-fluorescent components of the medium absorb excitation or emission radiation while reducing the fluorescence yield of an observed fluorophore [64]. The excited state fluorescence lifetime also changes with changes in the environment. Furthermore, the culture fluorescence depends on bioprocess variables, such as the optical density (OD), viscosity, pH, the aeration of the bioreactor and a lot of further the fluorescence measurements affecting variables [22].  Table 2 molecules that show biogenic fluorescence include the amino acids and vitamins as well as the co-enzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), NADH and reduced nicotineamide dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H [63].

This is known as an orbital. The further an orbital gets from the nucleus, the more they gain potential energy associated to a determined orbital. Quantum Mechanics explains that orbitals have quantized energy levels and for moving an electron to another level, it has to receive or emit the exact amount of energy corresponding to the difference between the two electronic levels (ΔE = E 1 -E 0 ). The amount of energy required to move and electron from energy level E 0 to energy level E 1 can be provided by heat due to a collision with other particles or absorb the energy of a photon. In this case, the energy of a Photon (E = h = hc/ ) should be equal to the difference between the orbitals (ΔE), this is, only a Photon of a particular wavelength is absorbed and can promote that transition. This phenomenon is known as atomic absorption. A more stable electron configuration of an atom is the one with less energy, also known as ground state configuration. The difference of energy between the last full orbital and the next empty orbital of the atom in a ground state is of the same order of magnitude of photons with wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm, this means, photons in ultraviolet regions and visible light of electromagnetic spectrum.

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (light) with matter, in our case proteins. Several closely related events can occur depending on the amount of energy that the radiation carries. In the first example of absorption, electromagnetic radiation is captured by a protein sample, which converts the energy of the photon into internal energy. Atoms within proteins are composed of a nucleus containing neutrons, protons and dispersed electrons. Electrons, however, are not merely floating within the atom but are instead fixed within electron orbitals. There are multiple electron orbitals within an atom, and each has its an energy level associated with it. Since the energy levels of matter are quantised, only light of energy that can cause transitions from one existing energy level to another will be absorbed. The amount of energy carried by a light photon depends on wavelength. The shorter the wavelength, the higher the energy carried by a photon; hence, ultraviolet (UV) light carries more energy than visible light. When a molecule absorbs a photon of the correct energy, an electron is promoted from its ground state to an excited state. This occurs if the energy of the photon, corresponding to the energy gap between the ground state and an empty higher energy level (the excited state). After absorption, the energy is then lost to the solvent as heat (thermal energy) when the electron drops back to the ground state. An absorption spectrum measures the amount of light that passes through a sample at a variety of wavelengths. The spectrum depends on the type and arrangement of atoms in the sample and can make absorption spectra useful for identifying different molecules. In this way, absorption spectroscopy can be used to reveal some very basic information about the structure and conformational states of a protein.\n\n\nBox 2 Properties of Light Box",

They typically contain relatively few atoms, ranging from about 1000 to 100 000. 3 This means that the crystals are large enough to be useful in the laboratory but small enough to exhibit quantum behaviours associated with individual atoms. Movement of electrons is confined in all three directions so tightly that QDs are said to be \"zero-dimensional\". As a result, changing the size of a QD controls how it absorbs and emits energy. This behaviour makes them appealing for a wide range of photonic and electronic applications. A quantum well is a sandwich of thin, stacked slices of semiconductor materials with different bandgaps. The bandgap is the energy required for an electron to jump from one energy level to another. 3 In a quantum well, the central layer has the smallest bandgap, which means that the larger gaps of the outer layers act like barriers, restricting the electrons in the middle one. This structure vertically confines the energy levels of the middle layer in one dimension. By controlling the size of that layer, scientists realized in the 1970s that they could tune the wavelengths-corresponding to colour-of photons emitted by the electrons. When a QD is provided with energy (i.e. it is in an excited state) the electron is boosted to a higher energy level, generating an exciton. When the electron returns to a lower level, the atom emits a photon of light with the same energy that the atom originally absorbed. The biggest QDs produce the longest wavelengths/lowest frequencies, while the smallest QDs make shorter wavelengths/higher frequencies. This indicates that big dots make red light and small dots make blue light, with intermediate-sized dots producing green light (and the familiar spectrum of other colours too). This effect is due to the bandgap size: a small dot has a bigger bandgap (the minimum energy it takes to free electrons so they will carry electricity through a material), so it takes more energy to excite it; because the frequency of emitted light is proportional to the energy, smaller dots with higher energy produce higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. Larger dots have more (and more closely) spaced energy levels, so they give out lower frequencies and therefore longer wavelengths. 19 QDs as a group of materials can have many differing structures and properties based on each component (Fig. 2). 20 They vary in their core and shell composition, in their size and",

An important part of luminescence phenomena is due to the influence of light (generally visible or ultra-violet light) on matter, such as for instance a molecule, which can emit light at a wavelength different from that absorbed. The classical Jablonski diagram (Figure 1, left part) represents electronic states of a molecule, and the transitions between these electronic states, depending on the energy. When a molecule absorbs light (a quantum of energy), it goes from a fundamental state (S 0 ) to an excited state (S 1 ). Depending on the type of molecules, two main ways can be taken to go back to the ground state: either a nonradiative decay of the energy absorbed, or the emission of fluorescence at a longer, less energetic wavelength. A third possibility (not shown in the Figure) concerns an intersystem conversion towards a triplet state (T 1 ), from which there will be emission of phosphorescence, having generally a lifetime longer than that of fluorescence. This classical one-photon excited fluorescence has led to the design of numerous types of chemical entities since the XIX century.

The organic dyes hold a narrow excitation wavelength and instability of emission. 14,15 However, the fluorescence behaviors of CDs do not conform to this rule, and they depend on the excitation wavelength. 16 CDs have excellent photostability due to the optical emission mechanism of the carbon core and the surface. 17 When exposed to exciting light for a long time, the luminescence intensity hardly decreases and no light flickers. 18,19 The stable fluorescence behavior of CDs can make up for the shortcomings of organic dyes and semiconductor quantum dots.

We suggest that this large difference in thermal conductivities of the fluorocarbon carrier oil and of the water should be at the origin of the difference in fluorescence properties of RhB in the two solvents. In particular, the small value of thermal conductivity of HFE-7500 should enhance a local accumulation of heat and an increased temperature under the illuminated volume dV of the solution sample by the highly focused excitation laser beam. When a RhB molecule absorbs an incident photon, the excited electronic state (S 1 ) may interact and exchange energy with the surrounding medium phonons. After a number of interactions, the excited electronic state will re-emit a photon, which can possess higher energy than that of the excitation photon. In this type of process, the additional energy of the emitted photon by anti-Stokes fluorescence is provided by the heat of the surrounding medium, while the excitation light, which irradiates the dye molecules, has a longer wavelength (lower energy) than that of the maximum emission, molecules located at a higher vibration energy level, also termed as 'hot band', can absorb these photons and reach the excited state. Coupling between excited state electron and thermal energy can occur also. Finally, the excited state can decay back to the ground state (S 0 ) and generate a fluorescence emission whose wavelength is shorter than that of the excitation light. Since the anti-Stokes luminescence process occurs at higher vibrational levels of the singlet ground state, it may prefer molecules with rich vibrational energy levels and is strongly temperature dependent due to the fact that the populations of higher vibrational energy levels are determined by Boltzmann distribution. Additionally, populations of higher vibrational energy levels are very limited, so effective anti-Stokes luminescence is usually observed in dye molecules with high quantum yield and molar extinction coefficient, such as Rhodamine B. We believe that hot-band absorption materials are very promising optical probes for diagnosis and detection in vivo [7].

We considered therein only one-dimensional fixed quantum number spaces X, which corresponds to an SVLs in terms of a fixed quantum number in one vibrational mode, i.e. the single vibrational mode excitation (e.g. |v, 0, · · · , 0 ). We have not used the space X for the SVL time-correlation function (TCF) in the complementary time-dependent (TD) approach, although by virtue of the developments reported in the previous sections such an application is straight forward.

Even for the usual absorption and emission processes, if we want to have the fine-grained integral prescreening strategy, we need to consider multi-dimensional X spaces.

One way to lose excitation energy is by emitting a photon of 589.0 nm, a phenomenon known as atomic emission. A photon of 330.3 nm can also be absorbed by sodium. This is the difference of energy between 3s and a 4p orbital (3.6eV), but one photon of 400 nm cannot be absorbed because there are not two orbitals in a sodium atom with the same difference of energy. The return of electron from 4p orbital to ground state can also occur in two steps: first to 4s and then to 3s by emitting two photons with energies correspondent to the two transitions in a phenomenon known as atomic fluorescence. The sodium atom can also receive enough energy to remove an electron, turning into sodium ion (Na + ), known as ionization. In this case, a change occurs in orbitals of different energy levels, so that the ion has a new set of transition being able to absorb or emit photons of wavelengths differently from metallic sodium. Each chemical element has a unique electronic structure that differentiates from others. This implies in a possible and unique set of transitions, a set of characteristic absorption/emission lines that can be used for identification. Although the set of transitions is unique for each element, there may be a coincidence of spectrum in some lines of two or more elements, which means that different atoms can absorb or emit photons of same wavelength. Even though the theoretical basis was established in the beginning of the twentieth century, only in the early 1950s an Australian physicist, Sir Alan Walsh, proposed the phenomenon",

In absorption, the molecule may undergo a process called transition as a consequence of the transference of energy, which is characterized by a change from an initial state to a posterior state. The molecular transition can be classified as electronic, vibrational, or rotational (30). Electronic transitions occur when the molecule absorbs a photon with energy compatible with wavelengths in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectral range. Vibrational transitions require radiation with typical wavenumbers between 400 and 4,000 cm −1 , i.e., infrared radiation. Rotational transitions occur when radiation with frequencies between 1.6 and 30 GHz is absorbed (microwave) (30). Vibrational transitions occur between different vibrational levels of the same electronic state, while rotational transitions occur between rotational levels of the same vibrational state (31) (Figure 2a). The basic rule for the occurrence of a transition is that the energy of the incident photon matches the energy difference between two states. In the case that the incoming photon does not match any molecular transition, the photon is scattered (28). Light scattering can be subdivided into elastic or inelastic. The first one does not involve energy exchange (the wavelength remains unchanged after scattering) such as Rayleigh and Mie/Tyndall scattering (28). Inelastic scattering is represented by Brillouin, Compton, and Raman scattering (28). In Raman, the incoming photons go into a virtual state and then are measured as scattered photons with different energy. Virtual states are created at the time of laser incidence and are not associated to electronic, vibrational, or rotational states of the molecule. If the photon transfers its energy to the molecule, the scattered photon will have lower energy and longer wavelength (Stokes scattering), which means that the initial state is the ground state, and after the scattering process, the final state is an excited vibrational state (Figure 2c). On the other hand, if the molecule is already in an excited vibrational state and transfers energy to the incident photon, the scattered",

The ions are compressed into two bunches of about 10 m length each by applying an RF voltage to one of the radio-frequency cavities installed in the ring. One bunch, referred to as signal bunch, is brought into overlap with the pulsed excitation laser inside the cooler straight section, while the other bunch is not illuminated by the laser and is used as reference for background correction (see figure 1). Fluorescence photons emitted by the HFS resonance in H-like bismuth are reflected by a mirror system installed in the vacuum pipe towards two view-ports and detected by two solar blind photomultiplier. This mirror system, which has also been used in earlier studies of HFS states in highly charged ions at the ESR [10], collects mainly photons emitted at angles between 15 • and 60 • relative to the beam direction. For the detection of the resonance in Li-like bismuth it is mandatory to collect the most forward emitted photons, as only these are Doppler shifted to a wavelength regime where the applied photomultiplier has the largest quantum efficiency. For this purpose a dedicated detection system was developed by the University of Münster [7]. It contains a movable parabolic mirror made of Oxygen-free high thermal conductivity (OFHC) copper with a central 3 cm slit for the ions to pass through.

It has the effect of transferring E = E 2 − E 1 (E i is the energy of the ith level) between the molecule and the environment, with a probability dependent on the coupling strength. Within this experiment all the photons are emitted along the zero phonon line, and as such we do not observe the effects of transitions within the vibrational modes. The zero phonon line corresponds to the emission of photons from the excited state with no vibrational energy to the ground state of the molecule. With sufficient resolution of the emission spectra, it is possible to distinguish between photons due to the transition from the excited state with non-zero phonons to the ground state. If we perform periodic measurements on the output field, we can perform a partial measurement on the state of the molecule, and measure the heat flux from the molecule to the environment. One benefit of this approach is that the notion of a trajectory is built into the formulation, giving the joint system trajectories shown in figure 3. We convert the time resolved trace of the photon statistics into the heat distribution which we find to be consistent  where α, β are the initial occupation probabilities of each level and n indicates the number of measurements which have been performed. This can be seen by examining figure 3 and noting that the two heat values correspond to the two 'edges' of the tree. The heat distribution is plotted in figure 4, for two different powers of driving laser, with the sample at 4 K. By examining the heat distribution given above, we can directly evaluate the Jarzynski equality for the heat distribution. This is directly related to the standard formulation of the Jarzynski equality through the first law of thermodynamics, U = W + Q. In particular, we find that the system satisfies e −β( U−Q) = 1, where U is the change in internal energy between the initial and final states of the joint system, for all time points during the period of spontaneous emission.

The most commonly used activators are Er 3+ , Tm 3+ , and Ho 3+ . Their unique energy level The energy transfer up-conversion process uses the excitation light to excite the sensitizer atoms, prompting them to transition from the ground state to the excited state. The electrons in the excited state have a transition down to the lower-energy excited state or back to the ground state, transferring the released energy to the activated ion in the form of a non-radiative FRET, which excites the activated ion to a higher energy state and finally transitions to the ground state producing a radiative transition. Therefore, this process is in line with the luminescence principle of up-conversion fluorescent probes. The energy transfer up-conversion process can be divided into the energy transfer upconversion process (Figure 5b), the relaxation up-conversion process (Figure 5c), and the continuous energy transfer up-conversion process (Figure 5d). The process requires that the concentration of rare earth atoms doped is high enough to ensure the effectiveness of energy transfer.\n\nThe cooperative up-conversion process can get to the high-energy state directly, and then radiate short-wavelength photons. It can be divided into the cooperative luminescence up-conversion process (Figure 5e) and the cooperative sensitization up-conversion process (Figure 5f).

Since there is no time lag during the transition, so fluorescence fades away as soon as the illumination is turned off. Phosphorescence, on the other hand, is observed when an electron undergoes a transition from triplet excited state to the singlet ground state. During this transition, the spin state of the molecule changes twice; once during singlet excited state to triplet excited state transition and the other during triplet excited state to singlet ground state transition, and both of these transitions are spinforbidden. However, due to spin-orbit coupling and vibronic coupling among the energy states, these transitions become allowed. Due to the change in spin orientation during transition, the electrons take a much longer time to come back to the singlet ground state, giving rise to a time gap between absorption and emission. Hence, phosphorescence fades after a long time, once the illumination is stopped. Therefore, the lifetime of phosphorescence is much longer than that of fluorescence, and is generally in the range of 10 À 3 -10 0 s. These radiative processes are governed by Kasha's rule, which states that electrons can get excited to any of the excited electronic states (like S 1 , S 2 , S 3 , etc.) depending on the wavelengths of absorbed radiation; however, most of the photons will emit from the lowest excited electronic state (i. e. S 1 or T 1 ). This happens due to rapid internal conversions from higher excited states to lower excited vibrational states. In other words, the emission wavelength is independent of absorption wavelength. The fluorescence intensity originating from a particular electronic level depends on the population of that level. According to the Boltzmann distribution law ð1 1 =1 2 ¼ e À D E = kT Þ when the temperature is increased, the thermal population of higher energy levels increases. The degree of the population of the higher levels also depends on the energy difference between two involving energy levels. The lower energy gap facilitates a higher population in exciting level. Hence, fluorescence intensity originating from those levels is higher compared to lower levels. [211] The efficient phosphors are the ones that have a high",

They result from absorption of a photon with appropriate energy and lead from the ground to an excited singlet state. Absorption of a photon by a molecule, represented in Fig. 1 by vertical arrows directed up to the S 1 or S 2 level, occurs essentially instantaneously relative to nuclear motion (∼ 10 −15 s). The initially excited molecule may find itself in any of the allowed vibrational levels of the S n electronic excited state. Subsequently, very rapidly (∼ 10 −13 s) decays to the lowest vibrational level of the S n state. If S n is a higher energy state than the lowest or first excited singlet state (i.e., n > 1), it will quickly (∼ 10 −11 s) decay nonradiatively by a process called internal conversion to the S 1 state, and finally to its lowest vibrational level. This state possesses a longer (fluorescence) lifetime, several nanoseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds, for most fluorophores of interest in biochemistry.\n\nThere are two radiative processes of return to the ground state shown in Fig. 1. Fluorescence that occurs from the S 1 state and phosphorescence that occurs from the T 1 state. This is known as the Kasha rule (Kasha 1950). It states that photon emission (fluorescence or phosphorescence) occurs in appreciable yield only from the lowest excited state of a given multiplicity.\n\nThe Jablonski diagram clearly shows that the wavelength of the fluorescence is independent of the wavelength absorbed, and that the emitted light is usually at longer wavelengths (lower energy) than the absorbed light (the Stokes shift). In some cases, further reduction of energy, leading to further red shift, occurs during the fluorescence lifetime by a phenomenon known as solvent relaxation. This involves re-orientation of solvent dipoles around the new excited state dipole. The reorientation favors new dipoledipole interactions, and lowers the overall energy of the system (Inamdar et al. 1995;Improta et al. 2007).",

The relative efficiencies of excitation at different wavelengths should play no role as the quantum yield measurements simply count photons emitted as a function of photons absorbed. If the S n (n > 1) states can emit detectable light in the steady-state measurement or participate in photochemical transformations, they become kinetically decoupled with the S 1 state and are essentially ascribed to the anti-Kasha systems. 5 In our case, they may display different probabilities of emission from N* and T* states depending on the excitation energy.\n\nThe observed effects are illustrated in Table 1, Fig. 5 and S5. † For 3-HTC-DiCN, the T* emission quantum yield rises (from 0.010 to 0.030 then to 0.060) with the increase of excitation photon energy (decrease of wavelength from 420 to 350 then to 300 nm). At the same time, the N* emission quantum yield descends from 0.007 to 0.006 then to 0.005. These results clearly indicate that the ESIPT reaction proceeds partially from the higher electronic excited states (with shorter excitation wavelengths), which consequently generates stronger T* emission and weaker N* emission. The same trend is also observed in the emissions of 3-HTCA.\n\nFor illustrating the magnitude of these effects, we normalized intensities at the N* band and observe dramatic changes in T* band intensities, their increase with shorter wavelength excitation (Fig. 5). This difference can be visualized even with the naked eye.

According to the Franck-Condon principle, assuming that the electronic transition is very fast compared to the nuclear motion in the molecule, when an electron-hole pair is created by an optical excitation, the final state will be in approximately the same atomic configuration as the initial state.

In thermal processes, vibrations are associated with small motions around potential energy surface minima. Chemical reactions are usually described as going over passes (transition states) on these hypersurfaces as the system moves from one valley (reactants) to another (products). Photoprocesses are much more complicated ( Fig. 1.1). Traditionally they include not only processs that begin by absorption of a photon, but also any process involving electronically excited states, such as chemiluminescence (e.g., in fireflies and glow worms) where the initial excitation energy is provided by a chemical reaction. The Frank-Condon approximation tells us that the initial absorption of a photon will take us from one vibronic state to another without much change of molecular geometry, thus defining a Frank-Condon region on the excited-state potential energy surfaces. The molecule can return to the ground state by emitting a photon of the initial wave length or, depending upon vibronic coupling and perturbations from surrounding molecules, the molecule may undergo radiationless relaxation to a lower energy excited state before emitting or it may even decay all the way to the ground state without emitting. If emission takes place from a long-lived excited state of the same spin as the ground state, then we speak of fluorescence. If emission takes place from an excited-state with a different spin due to intersystem crossing, then we speak of phosphorescence. If it is unsure whether the emission is fluorescence or phosphorescence, then we just say the molecule luminesces. Because of the large variety of de-excitation processes, excited molecules usually return too quickly to their ground state for the molecular geometry to change much. We then speak of a photophysical process because no chemical reaction has taken place. Thus fluorescence is usually described as an excited molecule relaxing slightly to a nearby minimum on the excited-state potential energy surface where it is momentarily trapped before it emits to the ground state. It follows that the photon emitted during fluorescence is Stokes shifted to a lower energy than the photon initially absorbed.",

The photon energy is equal to the difference between the initial total energy of the system Etot (horizontal dashed line at near energy of the v − = 19 state) and the energy of CN − ground state. (ii) IREA: As a first step of the process, the incident electron is captured via non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling into the ground electronic state of CN − without emitting a photon. Because the total energy Etot is conserved, the vibrational level v − of CN − in this first step of the process is highly excited: For low incident energies of the electron, it corresponds to v − = 18 or 19. After the first step, the electron captured in an excited vibrational level can either autodetach or stabilize by photon emission. The photon changes the rotational and vibrational states of the CN − molecule. The largest probability for the second step corresponds to a change of v − by one quantum. The dashed red line shows the derivative of the vibrational ground state wave function of CN, which enters in the calculation of the non-Born-Oppenheimer coupling in Eq. (11).",

Here the electron-electron correlations are treated by including single and double excitations, which is known to provide accurate results, even for highly correlated manyelectron systems. In fact, the CCSD approach is exact for two-electron systems in the absence of the cavity since the single and double excitations comprise the full configuration interaction limit (up to the choice of basis set). This is no longer valid when the cavity is present, since the cavity photons can be excited to an arbitrary level due to their bosonic nature. 49 Due to the large computational expense, the scQED-CC method has only been used for small molecular systems coupled to the cavity with typically one or two photonic excitations included. This approach is expected to provide reliable results, even for large light-matter coupling strengths. 34,41 However, such truncation of the photonic excitations has been shown to contradict the full configuration interaction limit in the strong coupling regimes for simple Hubbard model systems, even when using up to 10 photonic excitations. 49 Notably, this high-level photonic treatment is usually numerically intractable for models describing realistic molecular systems.\n\nIn this work, we explore the polaritonic ground state of the H 2 molecular system coupled to a single quantized cavity mode. We solve the Pauli-Fierz QED Hamiltonian in the long-wavelength approximation using the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) approach. This methodology is formally exact for the two-electron H 2 molecular system, even when many quantized photonic modes are considered. We then directly compare with state-of-the-art polaritonic coupled cluster methods to highlight the inherent approximations in such schemes. Various properties are examined, such as the localization of the electronic wavefunction and changes to the polaritonic potential energy surface. We also explore a decomposition of the photonic wavefunctions into the number (or Fock) basis. This analysis highlights the discrepancy between the scQED-CCSD and DQMC results due to the inclusion of high-level photonic excitations present even in the ground state. Finally, we examine the average photon number as a function of the nuclear separation length. Our results suggest the DQMC scheme as another chemically relevant approach toward modeling molecular and material systems inside the cavity.\n\n\nMethodology Electronic Hamiltonian",

In honour of professor Alexander Jablonski, this type of energy diagrams is often called the Jablonski diagram. It qualitatively represents electronic energy levels as bolded horizontal lines and vibrational energy levels as a stack of horizontal lines in vertical energy diagram. Straight and wavy vertical arrows represent transitions between the states, where straight arrow represents transition associated with photon, while wavy arrows represent non-radiative transfers. A radiative decay process is a process in which electron releases some of its excitation energy as photon, while in a nonradiative decay excess energy is transferred into thermal motions, as vibration, rotation and translation processes, heat. Once an electron is excited through very quick process of absorption of photon, into, for example, some vibronic state of second excited singlet state, there are several ways that energy may be dissipated. The first is through vibrational relaxation, a non-radiative process that lowers energy of electron to the lowest excited singlet state, with or without non-radiative internal conversion process, depending on the overlap of vibrational and electronic energy of different states. Next, a radiative process of energy transfer to ground singlet state is followed by emission of photons in terms of fluorescence. There is no change in multiplicity S 1 →S 0 , so the transition is spin allowed and consequently fast. Since there are a large number of vibrational levels in electronic states, transitions can result in a range of emitted wavelengths. There is also a probability of non-radiative relaxations between  the singlet states (S 1 ⤳S 0 ). If in the process of dissipating of energy spin multiplicity changes by slower process of intersystem crossing, energy can be radiatively emitted from lowest excited triplet state to ground singlet state by phosphorescence T 1 →S 0 , or non-radiatively by relaxations between the triplet and singlet states (T 1 ⤳S 0 ). Intersystem crossing and therefore phosphorescence are spin-forbidden processes; nevertheless, by coupling vibrational factors into the selection rules transitions become partially allowed, and they are consequently much slower.\n\n\nSynthesis of rare earth-doped anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles",

It is the absorption of light at one wavelength, and its re-emission as light of a longer wavelength (with less energy). It can be seen when you put certain laundry detergents under a simple black-light, which you cannot see with your eyes, and watch optical light come back out, making it 'glow'. Optical fluorescence like this is also a critical tool in almost all of biology, where even the most complex optical fluorescence microscopes still use monochromatic light and emission filters to image optically-fluorescent dyes and protein labels, revealing information about cellular structures. X-ray fluorescence imaging is fundamentally no different from this. However, unlike optical light which excites vibrational states, X-rays are of such energy that, for metals, they excite the electrons bound to the atom directly.\n\n\nBasics of X-ray fluorescence\n\nThe energy and wavelength of light are inversely related, as follows from Equation 1, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and  is the wavelength.\n\nwww.intechopen.com\nBiomarker 80 E = h ×c / λ (1)\nLooking at this equation, it is simple to see that if the energy of an incoming photon is decreased, such as might happen when it runs into an electron, the photon is not only reduced in energy but its wavelength will increase, changing its 'color'. In fact, the photon may excite the electron into a higher energy state. When this happens, it leaves behind an opening, or 'hole' in the electron shell. Since the spacing of orbitals, or the difference in energy between them, is constant for a particular metal atom, when an electron 'falls' back down in energy, into the 'hole' that was left behind, it emits light at a very characteristic energy -much like a pipe of a particular length on an organ plays a very specific note. It is this property of X-ray fluorescence, the fact that each element -zinc, copper, iron -will emit fluorescence at characteristic energies with specific relative intensities that are intrinsic to the metal itself, that makes it possible to distinguish the emission spectrum of iron from that of copper, for example. Or to distinguish how much of either one is present in a mixture.\n\n\nSpecial considerations for biological samples",

Cross sections are computed for photons with wavelengths starting at 500 Å up to at most 50,000 Å in 1 Å increments, typically stopping at the relevant threshold. A smaller wavelength step size is used near thresholds to resolve appropriate resonances.

The 2 1 Π and A′ 1 Σ + (2 1 Σ + ) transitions have the dominant cross sections from the ground rovibrational level, while the transition to the A 1 Π state makes very little contribution.

It is found that Bi 5 3+ polycations in Bi 5 (AlCl 4 ) 3 and Bi 5 (GaCl 4 ) 3 demonstrate similar theoretical excitation bands, resulting from their similar geometries (Fig. 9). Interestingly, both species have strong singlet-singlet allowed transitions at shorter wavelengths, which support well the experimentally observed excitation spectra as shown in Fig. 5b and 7b. However, at longer wavelengths (500-1000 nm), there remains a great discrepancy between experimental and calculated values, which was also observed when using other quantum chemistry softwares. 23 It is believed that this unsatisfactory consistence might result from the calculation method used here. Owing to high atomic number of bismuth (Z=83), spin-orbit coupling effect should be taken into consideration, which will greatly influences on orbital energies and allowed/forbidden transitions and makes singlet-triplet excitations accessible (i.e., the transitions become allowed). 17b However, it is worth to note that imaginary eigenvalue appears if we take spin-orbit coupling rather than scalar relativistic effect into account, when using ADF software for the excitation energies calculation.

Figure 1b illustrates how an extension of this scheme can be used to entangle the states of two three-level systems that are at different locations. Say Alice and Bob both have an identical version of such a three-level system prepared in the state |↓ . They both use a classical field to drive the |↓ − |e transition, in order to get very weak spontaneous emission from the |e − |↑ transition, such that each system emits an optical pulse that is a superposition of the photon-number states |0 puls and |1 puls (note that each of these pulses is then entangled with the system that emitted it). The timing and propagation of these two pulses should be controlled such that they arrive at the same time at a measurement station, that consists of a 50/50 beam splitter with a photon counter at each of its two output channels. If the number of photons in the pulses are now measured after combining the two pulses on the beam splitter, there is some probability that one of the two detectors counts 1 photon and the other 0 photons. In that case, the total number of spin flips in the two three-level systems is 1, but it is impossible to tell which of the two emitted the photon. As a result, the systems of Alice and Bob have been projected onto an entangled state of the form |Ψ AB = 1 √ 2 |↑ A |↓ B + e iϕ |↓ A |↑ B (where the phase ϕ can be derived from experimental conditions [14,21]). Figure 1b depicts in fact emission from ensembles of three level systems.

These molecules can scatter about 10 5 photons when additional two or more lasers are added to repump the vibrational leakage back to the optical cycling. The number of photon-scattering achieved in this \"quasi-cycling\" transitions is enough to cool the molecules down to Doppler limit and trap them in a MOT. Authors in Ref. [4] listed diatomic molecules that are predicted to have diagonal FCFs. Recent studies have revealed that even some big molecules with optical cycling center are expected to have good FCFs and thus suitable for laser cooling [1,26,30,31].\n\nDealing with the rotational structure of molecules is simpler. Transitions between the rotational states obey selection rules just as other angular momenta. One caution is that the rotational quantum number R starts from zero and expands to infinity for all states. When a molecule is in the electronic ground state with R = 0 initially, the electronically excited state should have R = 1 after the molecules absorbed a photon. According to the selection rules, this excited state can decay back to the electronic ground state with either R = 0 or R = 2, therefore forming a non-closed cycling transition. For the molecules to continue scattering photons, one should employ a transition from an electronic ground state with R = 1 to an electronic excited state with R = 0 [32].\n\nIn this configuration, there are more number of substates in the ground state than in the excited state, resulting in dark magnetic substates when the molecule scatters light with a fixed polarization. Therefore, one should pull the molecules out of the dark states to keep the optical cycling. There are two ways -one is remixing the magnetic substates using a magnetic field and the other is switching polarization of the light .",

During this interaction, the molecule gains energy and reaches a Bpolarized^or Bvirtual^state, which is not energetically stable and consequently the molecule comes down to the initial energy level by emission of photons. For a large majority of cases, the molecule will come back to its initial energy level, i.e., the lowest vibrational energy level of the ground state. This gives rise to elastically scattered photons with the same frequency as that of the incident laser. This event is the most probable and therefore predominates and is termed as BRayleigh scattering.^Since one gets back the same frequency as the incident excitation, Rayleigh light does not carry any chemical information. A second possibility is that the scattered light is inelastic in nature, i.e., the transition to the ground state gives rise to scattered photons that have either gained energy (anti-Stokes Raman) or given away some energy (Stokes Raman). In both cases, the difference between the initial and final states gives the energy of the vibrating bond and also corresponds to the difference in energy levels measured in IR spectroscopy (see Fig. 1). However, it must be noted that, while in IR spectroscopy a measurement of the absolute frequency is made, in Raman spectroscopy the measured frequency is relative since a difference is calculated with respect to the excitation frequency. This frequency difference is also called BRaman shift.^The spectral information scattering is when the photon is absorbed to a higher virtual state and is instantly scattered (emitted) elastically back to the initial state, without any change in its frequency. The photons emitted by Raman Stokes scattering usually have a lower frequency (red shifted) than that of the photons absorbed and these photons are inelastically scattered, transferring some of their energy to the molecule. The reverse is also possible; the photons emitted have a higher frequency than the photons absorbed (blue shifted). This is called Raman Anti-Stokes, but it is less likely at room temperature as the majority of electrons are in the ground state. Both Raman Stokes and anti-Stokes give the vibrational information as the Raman shift, which is the difference between the two vibrational energy states.

Luminescence arises when certain transitions (called spontaneous radiative transitions) of these species from the states with higher energy to the states with lower energy, including the ground state, take place. Depending on the excitation method, different types of luminescence are differentiated. Thus, photoluminescence occurs upon excitation by an optical radiation (usually in UV range), electroluminescence-when excited by an electrical field. The processes that accompany the luminescence are often visualized in Jablonski diagrams (Figure 1). Absorption of light occurs in a very short femtosecond timeframe and correspond to the excitation of the particle from the ground state (S0) to an excited state (S1, S2, …). It should be noted that each state has its own set of vibrational levels, which are populated upon excitation with different probabilities and when combined, form an absorption spectrum. After the absorption of a photon, the most probable process is called the internal conversion or vibrational relaxation. This process is longer that the excitation (picosecond timeframe) and is accompanied by a structural relaxation of the excited molecule. The excess energy is converted into heat and the relaxation is thus a nonradiative process. The molecule can exist in this excited state for nanosecond and longer and then returns to the ground state, emitting a photon in a process called fluorescence. Other events that can occur after the excitation include non-radiative relaxation upon collision of the excited molecule with other particles or intersystem crossing to the lowest excited triplet state (T1). Relaxation from the triplet state to the ground state with photon emission is called phosphorescence. Transition back to the S1 state is also possible, followed by a delayed fluorescence. Coordination polymers are complex systems consisting of metal ions, one or more ligand types, inclusion of solvent molecules or other guests in voids is also possible. Emission of light by the coordination polymers can arise from various types of electron transitions-intraligand (ligandcentered), metal-centered, metal-to-ligand and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (MLCT and LMCT), Figure 1.

As shown in Figure 4A, the UV-Vis spectra of CQDs had a strong absorption peak at 277 nm and a weak shoulder peak at 331 nm. The peak at 277 nm is attributed to the π-π* transition of the C C bond, in which the orbital was sp 2hybridized clusters (Guo et al., 2016). The peak at 331 nm is assigned to the n-π* transition of the C O groups (Zhang and Chen, 2014).

The emission peaks of CQDs were gradually red-shifted with the increase in excitation wavelength from 320 to 410 nm. The CQDs exhibited a maximum emission at 440 nm when the excitation wavelength was 350 nm. This result suggested that the fluorescence emission spectra of CQDs were heavily dependent on the excitation wavelength. In addition, the O-containing groups on sp 2 -hybridized carbon could induce local distortion, and the O-related defect state can further cause energy gaps. The electrons from the ground state are excited to the various energy levels of π* by excitation. The surface excited electrons are trapped by the O-related defect state, resulting in the back-transition of the electrons from the excited state to ground state (Yang et al., 2019).

Molecules consist of multiple atoms so that they have additional degrees of freedom compared to atoms. They are vibration (quantum number v) and rotation (quantum number R) of the constituting nuclei. Transitions between rotational states obey selection rules, and one can form a closed cycling transition by exciting the molecules from states with rotational quantum number R = 1 to states with R = 0. However, there are no selection rules for vibrational states. A transition probability from one vibrational state to another is only determined by the overlap of the involved vibrational wavefunctions, whose absolute square is called Franck-Condon factors (FCFs). When a molecule in a particular vibrational state in the electronic ground state is excited by a laser to a state in the electronic excited state, the molecule can decay into many vibrational states in the electronic ground state depending on its FCFs. Once the molecule decays into states other than its initial state, the molecule cannot absorb the laser anymore and the optical cycling ceases. To overcome this problem, one would need to add many lasers to put the molecule back to the optical cycling. Therefore, it has been considered for a long time that laser cooling of molecules is not feasible. Spectroscopy done [26] The flow changed when people found that some diatomic molecules have highly diagonal FCFs [4][5][6]. When excited, these molecules predominately decay to their initial states. By adding a few lasers to repump some \"leakage\", one can form a quasi-cycling transition that can achieve enough photon scattering to cool the molecules down to the Doppler limit temperatures. Based on this idea, one dimensional laser cooling, longitudinal laser slowing, and eventually a magneto-optical trap (MOT) for molecules have been demonstrated successfully. Also, this idea can be extended to polyatomic molecules as well, and a MOT for CaOH molecules has been achieved recently [7].

The excited singlet state photosensitizer is very unstable and short lived. It loses its excess energy by production of heat through internal conversion and returns to its ground state by emitting a fluorescent photon. The excited singlet state photosensitizer molecule may also undergo intersystem crossing, in which the excited electron spin is reversed to form a more stable triplet state photosensitizer [T 1 ]. The triplet state photosensitizer molecule can decay back to ground state by emitting a phosphorescent photon. This decay is slow since it involves a spin forbidden process, with a lifetime of microseconds compared to nanoseconds for the decay of an excited singlet state photosensitizer. The excited triplet state photosensitizer can undergo two types of photochemical reactions, characterized as type I and type II reactions that create cytotoxic reactive oxygen species that ultimately result in photodynamic damage. Both type I and type II reactions can occur simultaneously and the ratio between these processes depends on the type of photosensitizer, the concentration of substrate and the availability of oxygen.

Intense absorption in the wavelength less than 600 nm by in vivo pigments (mainly hemoglobin) and less efficiency of singlet oxygen production in the wavelength more than 900 nm sometimes eliminate the clinical applications to the region of 600-900 nm [78].\n\n\nMechanism of competitive reactions in photodynamic therapy\n\nFollowing the absorption of a photon with appropriate energy, the photosensitizer molecule is transferred from the ground state (S 0 ) to excited state (S 1 ) which may return to its primitive ground state along with fluorescence radiation or be transferred to triplet excited state as an inter-system crossing. The triplet state of photosensitizer molecule in the tissue has a relatively long lifespan which can cause changes in surrounding molecules and initiate two competitive reactions called reaction types I and II (Fig. 1) [10,24].\n\nReaction type I includes the transfer of electron or proton to oxygen and surrounding molecules to form anionic or cationic radicals. These radicals can react with oxygen molecule to form the reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reaction type I often leads to the formation of superoxide ions by the transfer of one electron to an oxygen molecule. These ions do not act as active ions in biological systems, but they can produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which is easily absorbed from cell membranes. In high concentrations, H 2 O 2 can react with super oxide molecules caused by the production of hydroxyl as an active radical which has the ability to ionize any molecules with low activation energy.\n\nIn reaction type II, the photosensitizer molecule, by transitioning from the triplet state to ground state and transfer of energy to oxygen molecule, converts it to excited singlet oxygen.

The hybridized nature of the ground state in a cavity can not only modify the energy or the ionization potential 202,255 but also the electronic density of the ground state. 172,174,198,254 For a fixed coupling strength the magnitude of these effects also depends on the position of the (clamped) nuclei/ions, i.e., since the relevant lengths scale ∆l from above is also modified.

Steady-state fluorescence quenching and fluorescence polarization are the primary techniques for studying structure and function of proteins. In fluorescence spectroscopy, light absorption promotes an electron to an excited state, resulting in light emission when the excited electron returns to the ground state undergoing a radiative transition. Since some of the light energy initially absorbed is lost in transition between vibrational energy levels (internal conversion), the emitted light energy is always of a longer wavelength (Moller and Denicola 2002). Fluorescence quenching refers to the process that decreases the fluorescence intensity of a sample. Proteins display fluorescence, and the intrinsic protein fluorescence is due to aromatic amino acids, mainly tryptophan, considering that phenylalanine has a very low quantum yield, and emission by tyrosine in native proteins is often quenched. Fluorescence is mainly due to tryptophan, which can be selectively measured by exciting at 295 nm, because there is no absorption by tyrosine at this wavelength. Tryptophan fluorescence is highly sensitive to the environment polarity, and shifts in its emission spectrum towards lower wavelengths (blue shift) can be observed as the increased hydrophobicity. Changes in emission spectra from tryptophan can be seen in response to protein conformational transitions, subunit association, ligand binding, or denaturation, which affect the environment surrounding the indole ring. The lifetime of a fluorophore (i.e. the time the fluorophore spends in the excited state) is very short, ranging from 0.5 to 100 ns, but sufficiently long for the excited fluorophore to react with external molecules to yield an excited product that decays by a non-radiative pathway, and therefore, diminishes the fluorescence quantum yield. This process is known as dynamic or collisional quenching, and the external molecule is known as the quencher (Lakowicz 1999). Many biological molecules display fluorescence, such as reduced nicotinamide dinucleotide (NADH), oxidized flavins (FAD, adenine dinucleotide, FMN, and mononucleotide), pyridoxal phosphate, chlorophyll, and proteins (Lakowicz 1999).",

Photochemical reactions typically involve radical processes, and often these radical processes can be used to install functional groups that would be otherwise difficult to install [7]. In the field of photocatalysis, transition-metal-mediated photoredox catalysis is a heavily studied area because of the efficiency and tunability of the photoredox-relevant properties of transition-metal complexes; metals such as Ru [1][2][3][4]6,8], Ir [1][2][3], and others [9] have been studied for their efficient photocatalytic properties. Properties used to define an effective photocatalyst include absorbance, excitation, and emission wavelengths; quantum yield; luminescence lifetime; and the ground-and excited-state electrochemical potentials of metal complexes [10].\n\nThe absorbance and excitation wavelengths of a complex are the first indicators of usefulness in visible-light-promoted reactions. Visible-light-promoted reactions are favorable over UV-promoted reactions because side reactions can be promoted by higher-energy UV light. Absorbance and excitation wavelengths outside of the visible-light range are not viable for visible-light-promoted reactions. The emission wavelength of a complex describes the energy of the emitted photons from a complex and also is related to the difference between ground-and excited-state electrochemical potentials. Quantum yield measures the efficiency of a complex to convert absorbed light into emitted light, where higher quantum yields indicate more efficient conversions. The luminescence lifetime of a complex is a measure of the time that a complex is in its excited state before emitting a photon. Longer luminescence lifetimes correlate with more opportunity for electron transfer from catalyst to substrate [10]. The groundand excited-state electrochemical potentials of a complex describe the electrochemical properties of a complex and their thermodynamically allowed range of reactivity. The photochemical reactions discussed in this review are reductions; therefore, more negative excited-state potentials enable the reduction of compounds that are more difficult to reduce.

Typically, resonant ionization occurs via their π−π* transition in a (1 + 1) REMPI scheme with UV photons of about 260 nm. The studied peptides are nonrigid molecules and can adapt multiple conformations with different intramolecular interactions in the gas phase. These small changes in the chemical environment of the chromophore can lead to large differences in the REMPI spectra. This results in conformer selectivity of the REMPI technique; for example, by selecting a single wavelength, a single conformer can be ionized. A typical REMPI spectrum shows a wealth of peaks besides the S 1 −S 0 origin transition (Figure 4.b). Transitions from the vibronic ground state to the vibrationally excited states of the electronically excited state are observed at higher photon energies (highlighted in violet in Figure 4b), forming a vibrational progression. Another feature that can be seen in REMPI spectra is the so-called hot band, which can be used to determine the vibrational temperature of the molecule (section 2.2.1).

When this IR frequency is resonant with a vibrational transition of the selected conformer, IR photon(s) are absorbed and population is transferred from the vibrational ground state to a vibrational excited level of the electronic ground state; see Figure 4c.

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane. The resulting ν s value amounts to (836 ± 18) cm −1 . It is in good agreement with the values, (823 ± 14) cm −1 , 825 cm −1 , and (850 ± 25) cm −1 observed in acetone [7], [C 4 mim][Tf 2 N] [8], and in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] [9], respectively. This vibration corresponds to a Raman active vibration of the uranyl unit and can be correlated to the yl-U -O bond length. Using the empiric relation of Bartlett and Cooney [47]:\nR U−O /(Å) = 106.5 × ν −2/3 s + 0.575(1)\nwe calculated the U -O bond length to be equal to (1.77 ± 0.01) Å (using ν s = (836 ± 18) cm −1 ) for our uranyl sample. This value is in a good agreement with all experimental data listed in Table I, and can therefore serve as reference data to assess the accuracy of the ab initio calculations we will now discuss.",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

[10]. The poor resolution of the presently used apparatus did not allow to resolve well some of the transitions, and revealed only the wide components. Moreover, a difference of the relative intensities is observed around 20 295 cm −1 in n-dodecane due to the long gate width selected for our measurements and small deviations, as the spectrum was predicted by a Lorentzian fit (Table S1 in ESI). The spectrum in n-dodecane is shifted to the blue side by 30 cm −1 , compared to the one in acetone, and only by 5 cm −1 with respect to the one in [Bu 3 MeN][Tf 2 N] ionic liquid [9]. Thus, from the measurements, one can conclude that neither the counter-ion nor the type of solvent have any significant influence on the position of maxima of the luminescence bands. The change in the relative intensities of the transitions along the vibronic progression has been attributed by Sornein et al. [9]  of C -H···Cl hydrogen bonding between the chloride of the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2moiety and a hydrogen atom of a cation present in the ionic liquid. As we are using an aprotic solvent (n-dodecane), this effect may also be present in our uranyl tetrachloride sample.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section. The observed agreement encourages the application of these potentials for 20",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

Experimental luminescence spectra\n\nThe time-resolved luminescence spectrum of the uranyl sample in the presence of chloride ions and Aliquate ® 336 in n-dodecane with 1% of 1-decanol is shown on Figure 5 (black line). It is superimposed with the spectrum (red line) acquired by Görller-Walrand et al. in similar conditions and in acetone [7]. The spectrum also compares well to those obtained earlier in chloroaluminate [17], tetraalkylammonium [9] and pyrrolidinium [8] ionic liquids. The spectrum of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane in Figure 5 show an electronic transition maximum (\"hot band\") at low energy about 21 000 cm −1 followed by a series of vibronic peaks in the 20 300 cm −1 to 16 000 cm −1 range, which is typical of the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2species with a D 4h coordination symmetry [46]. A mono-exponential decay with a fluorescence lifetime of 0.3 µs was measured for the uranium(VI) sample in a presence of chloride ions, Aliquate ® 336 and n-dodecane. It confirms the formation of a unique complex, which was assumed to be [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] with four chloride ions coordinated to uranyl in its equatorial plane, consistently with the extracted complex stoichiometry [10].",

The counter-ions in the secondcoordination sphere only sligthly affect the calculated frequencies with respect to the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2bare ion; the uranium-chloride stretching mode is 29 cm −1 higher, the uranyl bending mode has increased by 13 cm −1 , while the uranyl symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching modes were found to be lower by 18 and 14 cm −1 , respectively. This is a result of the loss of symmetry together with the interplay of some motions of hydrogen and carbon atoms in alkyl chain in the vibrational motions. Based on the Franck-Condon principle, one can note that it should improve the band spacing between the vibronic progressions of theoretical luminescence spectrum that will be discussed further.\n\nThe shifts of theoretical frequencies between the ground and excited state of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] are found to be similar to what was experimentally obtained for Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 . The computed uranyl symmetrical stretching mode shifted by 74 cm −1 , very close to the experimental value of 82 cm −1 . However, the ν U−Cl and ν b do not vary during the excitation. We will later discuss the impact of this on the computed vibronic spectra.\n\n\nC. Theoretical absorption and emission energies\n\nAs the luminescence spectrum of uranium (VI) complexes arises from the electronic transition from the lowest excited state to the ground state, coupled to progression of vibronic bands, the examination of the whole electronic spectrum is useless. In this step, we aim at foreseeing the sensitivity of the quantum chemical method on the first triplet excited state absorption and emission energies of the uranyl tetrachloride complex, and on the spectral features of uranium (VI) complexes.",

[12][13][14]. The AGS equations (2) are solved numerically in the momentum-space partial-wave representation. Six sets of base functions spins of the corresponding particles, among them only s i A depends on the Hilbert sector i, i.e., s g A = 0 and s x A = 2 in the considered case of the 20 O nucleus with the ground and first excited states 0 + and 2 + , respectively. All discrete angular momentum quantum numbers, via the intermediate angular momenta S i α , j i α , and S i α , are coupled to the total angular momentum J with the projection M . We note that the spin s x A = 2 implies roughly five times more basis states in H x as compared to H g , thereby increasing the demand on computer memory and time by a factor of 20 to 40. Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O. Well-converged results for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions are obtained by including J ≤ 25 states with L A ≤ 3, L p ≤ 5, and L n ≤ 10. Higher value for L n is needed due to the Coulomb force present within the A + p pair which is included via the screening and renormalization method [19][20][21].\n|p α q α (l α {[L α (s i β s i γ )S i α ]j i α s i α }S i α )JM\n\nPotentials",

In contrast, for the ℓ = 1 transfer leading to the excited state 11 Be( 1 2 − ) the core-excitation effects have been less remarkable. It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons. First, the 21 O( 5 2 + ) ground state has a significant component of D-wave neutron coupled to the 20 O(0 + ) ground state, thereby allowing the extension of systematics from Refs. [12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions. Last but not least there are experimental data for 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy [16] that have not yet been analyzed with rigorous Faddeev-type calculations.",

The former consists in modifying T gg α through intermediate core excitations, i.e., through the terms of type v gx α G x 0 v xg α and so on in the iterated coupled-channel Lippmann-Schwinger equation (1). The contribution of the three-body nature arises due to nondiagonal components T xg α and T gx α that are responsible for the coupling of the two Hilbert sectors in Eq. (2), i.e., T gx βδ βα G x 0 T xg α and so on, yielding, in fact, an energy-dependent effective three-body force (E3BF). Lowest-order diagrams for both types are depicted in Fig. 1. We note a formal similarity between these contributions and the so-called dispersive and three-nucleon force effects arising in the description of the three-nucleon system with the ∆-isobar excitation [17,18]. Since the full core-excitation effect will be extracted from the solution of Eq. (2), to get insight into the importance of separate two-and and three-body contributions it is enough to exclude one of them. It is most convenient to do so for the E3BF, whose exclusion can be achieved by setting T kj γ = δ kg δ jg T gg γ in Eq. (2). This type of results will be labeled in the following as \"no E3BF\".",

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range. Having no more experimental data, we simply take additional energy value larger by a factor of 3, i.e., E d = 63\n\nMeV. As the core excitation effects for KD and CH turn out to be quite similar, we show only KD results that in general are closer to the experimental two-and three-body data. We multiply KD single-particle β 2 = 0 differential cross sections by the respective SF of the model with the core excitation and compare with the KD(β 2 = 0.5) results fully including the core excitation. The difference between these two results, or the deviation of the ratio  The experimental data at E d = 21 MeV are from Ref. [16].\nR x = dσ/dΩ(β 2 = 0.5) SF · dσ/dΩ(β 2 = 0)(4)\nfrom unity indicates violation of the factorization conjecture. We start with the excited state 1 2 + analysis in Fig. 4 where we expect some similarities with the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) case [12][13][14]. At E d = 21 MeV the two curves are close but, at least below the first minimum, differ by a roughly constant factor, i.e., the core excitation effect is slightly, by about 6%, stronger than predicted by the factorization conjecture.",

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref. [16].",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

To the best of our knowledge, potentials specifically designed for the N + 20 O interaction including the core excitation are not available. The corresponding experimental data are scarce, we are aware of only two p+ 20 O elastic and inelastic scattering measurements at 30 [22] and 43 [23] MeV/nucleon beam energies. In these works the data have been analyzed using DWBA or coupled-channel calculations with global optical potentials, e.g., [24]. Extracted values of the quadrupole vibrational coupling parameter β 2 are 0.50 ± 0.04 [22] and 0.55 ± 0.06 [23]. We also base our calculations on global optical potentials but use more modern parametrizations, namely, those of Koning-Delaroche (KD) [25] and Chapel Hill 89 (CH) [26]. These potentials were designed for A ≥ 24 and A ≥ 40 nuclei, respectively, but one may expect a reasonable extrapolation also to A = 20, especially for the KD potential. To include the core excitation, we extended these potentials for quadrupole vibrations [1] and modify by the subtraction method of Ref. [13] adding a nonlocal contribution. The terms up to the second order in β 2 as given in Ref. [1] are taken into account in our calculations. It turns out that such an approach reproduces the experimental data for elastic and inelastic differential cross sections of Refs. [22,23] reasonably well using the same value β 2 = 0.5 as shown in Fig. 2, especially for the KD potential. To study the sensitivity to β 2 , we also show CH predictions with β 2 = 0.55, that yield a better description of the inelastic cross section.

Some of the ground-state vibrational frequencies are responsible for the band spacing in the experimental luminescence spectrum, while the atomic displacement between the ground and excited-state geometries is responsible for the intensities ratio. The uranium -halide (ν U−X ), uranium -oxygen(ν s ) symmetrical stretching modes and uranium -oxygen bending mode (ν b ) contribute to the luminescence spectra shape to a large extent, and their values for the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2complexes are listed in Table II.

Using the vibrational perturbation theory [52,53] as implemented in Gaussian 16 [25], we have computed the anharmonic corrections, which turned out to be small, of the order of 5 and 3 cm −1 for the ground and excited states respectively (See Table S2 in the ESI).\n\nFor the gas-phase [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2model, the computed ν U−Cl , ν b , ν s and ν a frequencies are smaller in the excited state than in the ground state by 4, 4, 80 and 115 cm −1 , respectively. The PBE0 calculations reproduce with an impressive accuracy the measured red shift of the stretching mode, ν s , 82 cm −1 , in Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 , and underestimates that for the bending mode, 20 cm −1 . The latter discrepancy has negligible impact as the symmetric stretching ν s dominates the vibronic progressions in the luminescence spectra.",

Replacing the CD Bonn potential in the 3 S 1 − 3 D 1 partial wave by a central one reproducing deuteron binding and, roughly, n-p 3 S 1 and 3 D 1 phase shifts, leads to small but visible changes (smaller than KD -CH difference) in the cross sections. However, we do not consider such a n-p potential as realistic and therefore performed another test calculation with the realistic Argonne V18 potential [31] that has a stronger tensor force and a larger deuteron D-state probability as compared to CD Bonn. In this case the differences were minor, so we conclude that uncertainties in a realistic n-p force do not affect the 20 \n\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe analyzed 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions taking into account the vibrational excitation of the 20 O core. Calculations were performed using Faddeev-type equations for transition operators that were solved in the momentumspace partial-wave representation. Well converged results were obtained for several interaction models based on the vibrational extension of KD and CH potentials.\n\nThe only available experimental differential cross section data for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy are quite well described by our calculations including the core excitation. Some sensitivity to the underlying potential was observed, but the core-excitation effects turn out to be almost independent of it. The precise value of the quadrupole vibrational coupling β 2 also turns out to be irrelevant provided that spectroscopic factors are fixed that we take from shellmodel calculations. At this lowest considered energy we found that the core-excitation effect can be approximated to a good accuracy (6% for the 1 2 + state and even better for the 5 2 + state) by a simple reduction of the single-particle cross section according to the respective SF. Thus, the extraction of the SF through the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section as performed in Ref. [16] is a reasonable procedure. Nevertheless, our prediction for a slightly stronger reduction of the 1 2 + cross section leads to an even better agreement between the shell model SF and experimental data.",

Including more states of the core, e.g., the second excited state 4 + would be even significantly more demanding, and for this reason we restrict our present calculations to the inclusion of 0 + and 2 + states of 20 O.

We start with 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy, corresponding to the deuteron beam energy E d = 21 MeV, where the experimental data [16] are available. The results obtained without (β 2 = 0) and with (β 2 = 0.5) core excitation based on KD and CH potentials are presented in Fig. 3. The core excitation effect for the transfer to the 21 O ground state 5 2 + is very large. It strongly reduces the differential cross section bringing it in a good agreement with the experimental data. The sensitivity to the potential model is visible except at very small angles but remains smaller than experimental error bars. To study the sensitivity to β 2 we include also CH-based predictions with β 2 = 0.55; they are almost indistinguishable from the corresponding β 2 = 0.5 results, indicating that the value of β 2 is not critical for transfer observables provided that other properties are fixed. Same conclusions regarding the sensitivity to β 2 and potential apply also for the transfer to the 21 O excited state 1 2 + . However, in this case the core excitation effect is smaller, although it also reduces the differential cross section bringing it closer to the data, except for few points at larger angles. There is also some mismatch between predicted and measured positions of the minimum. We note that for both reactions KD predictions are slightly higher, possibly due to a larger elastic N + 20 O cross section.\n\nObviously, the reduction of the differential cross section the vibrational core excitation based on KD and CH potential models are compared with the experimental data from Ref.

The available experimental cross section data at 10.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy for the 21 O ground state 5 2 + and excited state 1 2 + are quite well reproduced by our calculations including the core excitation. Its effect can be roughly simulated reducing the single-particle cross section by the corresponding spectroscopic factor. Consequently, the extraction of the spectroscopic factors taking the ratio of experimental data and single-particle cross section at this energy is a reasonable procedure. However, at higher energies core-excitation effects are much more complicated and have no simple relation to spectroscopic factors. We found that core-excitation effects are qualitatively very different for reactions with the orbital angular momentum transfer ℓ = 0 and ℓ = 2, suppressing the cross sections for the former and enhancing for the latter, and changes the shape of the angular distribution in both cases. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature.\n\nIntroduction",

Theoretical luminescence spectra\n\nTo simplify the comparison within all spectra, let them be obtained from our quantum chemical calculations or from experiment, they are all normalized so that the first peak matches the experimental amplitude. Neither homogeneous and heterogeneous line broadening effects are included because of their complicated prediction [2]. We will thus only discuss the stick spectra.\n\nThe most relevant parameters influencing the spectral intensity distribution are the vibrational wavefunctions of both initial and excited states. The spectral shape is significantly linked to the bond-length changes between the two electronic states, as identified by Su et al. [4] thanks to a semi-classical vibronic approach. Especially, they concluded that the computed bond-length of the excited state is estimated without a sufficient accuracy to properly simulate the intensities. In our study, the theoretical luminescence spectra of [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2and [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2in gas phase are displayed on Figure 9. In all uraniumbased compounds at room temperature (300 K), luminescence arises from a low oscillator strength electron transition followed by the vibrational progression in the ν s mode of the electronic ground state, as the ν s is totally symmetric and preserves the symmetry of the vibronic (electronic+vibrational) wave function. The first observed band corresponds to the 0-0 vibrational transition. In the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2 -, the totally symmetric ν U−Cl mode is also excited vibronically, contributing to a line in the vibronic progression which is distant from the 0-0 line by 235 cm −1 . However, as we already commented upon the fact that the U-X lengthening from the ground and excited states is underestimated by our quantum approach, we cannot expect the computed relative intensities to match the experimental ones. Still, our predicted spectra place the peaks distribution and band spacing in great agreement with the experimental results. The complete assignment of the observed peaks is provided in ESI.",

However, [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2luminescence spectrum displays some more intense contributions and longer vibronic pro-  9). This results from a larger geometrical displacements between the ground and excited state structures (see Table S10 in ESI), which leads to the appearance of several U-Br vibrational modes in a spectrum. The computed luminescence spectrum of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in gas phase is overlaid with the experimental one on Figure 10. This figure highlights the fact that both the energy positions and the band spacing of the computed vibronic transitions match nicely the experimental envelope, though with the reserve that the band spacing is somewhat red shifted as the ground state symmetrical stretching is slightly overestimated by the R-ECP DFT/PBE0 level of theory. The added value of the theoretical simulation lies in the assignment of the vibronic levels, as detailed in Table S9 of the ESI. In agreement with Görller-Walrand et al. [7] results, our theoretical approach reproduced a contribution from symmetrical stretching and rocking vibrational modes. On the contrary, the doubled U-Cl symmetrical vibrational mode contribution was observed rather than out-of-plane bending of equatorial ligands contribution.\n\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS",

The counter-ions in the secondcoordination sphere only sligthly affect the calculated frequencies with respect to the [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2bare ion; the uranium-chloride stretching mode is 29 cm −1 higher, the uranyl bending mode has increased by 13 cm −1 , while the uranyl symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching modes were found to be lower by 18 and 14 cm −1 , respectively. This is a result of the loss of symmetry together with the interplay of some motions of hydrogen and carbon atoms in alkyl chain in the vibrational motions. Based on the Franck-Condon principle, one can note that it should improve the band spacing between the vibronic progressions of theoretical luminescence spectrum that will be discussed further.\n\nThe shifts of theoretical frequencies between the ground and excited state of [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] are found to be similar to what was experimentally obtained for Cs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 .

In Section IIIB the vibrational part was completely neglected by equating the right hand side of eq. (1) solely to the N O E b of the different computed configurations. The formally correct procedure would be to evaluate for each configuration also the vibrational free energy contribution to the binding energy, F vib. b (T ), and consider it in the parameterization. As apparent from eq. (6), what determines this vibrational contribution are the changes of the vibrational modes during adsorption. Since this will predominantly concern the adsorbate-derived vibrational modes, we estimate the order of magnitude of this contribution by the zero point energy (E ZPE ) difference arising from the change of the O 2 stretch frequency, ω O2(gas) , to the O-substrate stretch mode, i.e. we approximate eq.

Taking the difference between the estimated p(2 × 2)-O and the c(2 × 2)-O vibrational free energy contributions as a measure of the coverage dependence we thus arrive at an uncertainty of ∼ 5 meV in the lateral interactions and an uncertainty of ∼ 30 meV in the on-site energy due to the neglect of vibrational contributions in our approach. The on-site energy is thus much more affected by the predominantly non-coverage dependent shift in vibrational frequency from the O 2 stretch to the O-substrate stretch mode.\n\n\nNumerical uncertainties in the DFT energetics",

The bands are not equally spaced, as the oscillator strength of the electronic transition from the excited state to the highest vibrational level of the ground state is very small. As a result large uncertainty exist on the determination of the \"hot band\" maximum. One can extract ν s value by only taking into account the spacing between the vibrational maxima of the same nature for [A336] 2 [UO 2 Cl 4 ] in n-dodecane.

It is therefore very important to clarify the systematics of the core-excitation effects in transfer reactions, investigating other types of excitation mechanisms and bound states. Furthermore, a deeper understanding may be gained by disentangling the effects of two-and three-body nature. The study of 20 O(d, p) 21 O transfer reactions intended in the present work leads to the desired goal and is interesting for several reasons.

[12][13][14] to the D-wave neutron state and ℓ = 2 transfer. Second, the lowest excitation of the 20 O core 2 + has a vibrational character, giving opportunity to investigate the vibrational model for the nucleon-core interaction [1] in the context of transfer reactions.

Thus, in this regime one really needs to perform full calculations with the core excitation and should not rely on a single-particle cross section to extract the SF. For example, we found that at 31.5 MeV/nucleon beam energy the SF extracted in this naive way would be about 70% too small for the 1 2 + state but 80% too large for the 5 2 + state. This also demonstrates that core excitation acts very differently in the S and D-wave neutron states. In the S-wave case the results are qualitatively consistent with previous findings for reactions involving the 11 Be( 1 2 + ) but based on the rotational model.\n\nTaking into account also the study of the 21 O * (p, d) 20 O(2 + ) reaction, we are able to make an important conclusion on a systematic effect of the quadrupole core excitation at higher energies: it substantially suppresses reactions with ℓ = 0 transfer but enhances those with ℓ = 2. The shape of the angular distribution of the differential cross section is changed in both cases. Of course, the quantitative size of these effects depends on the collision, binding, and excitation energies. Furthermore, the core-excitation effect is a result of a complicated interplay between its contributions of the two-and three-body nature; including only the twobody effect through the modification of the potential is computationally simpler but not justified.",

With increasing of polarity the ν U−Cl stretching frequencies insignificantly increase (4 and 7 cm −1 ) for the ground and excited states, respectively, while the uranyl ν b , ν s and ν a decrease by 5 up to 25 cm −1 in both states. This shift of the ground-state frequencies should be observable in the computed luminescence spectra, namely in the spacing between the vi- brationally resolved peaks, while the minor change of the excited state frequencies should only affect the vibronic intensities. The substitution of chlorides by bromides in the uranyl equatorial plane lead to the following changes in the vibrational spectra. Compared to uranyl tetrachloride, the ν b value decreased by less than 10 cm −1 in both ground and excited states. The ν s increased by 13 and 62 cm −1 in the ground and excited states, respectively. Similarly, the ν a increased by 14 cm −1 for the ground and 76 cm −1 for the first excited state. The U -Br stretching mode is 83 cm −1 lower in both ground and excited states than the U -Cl symmetric stretching vibration. This is in line with the ground-state experimental trends measured for\nCs 2 UO 2 Cl 4 with [C 7 H 16 NO 2 ][UO 2\nBr 4 ] (91, 2, 6 and 9 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively). These changes indicate that the bromide ligand has a smaller effect on the electronic structure of uranium than chloride, since the U-Br bond strength is essentially ionic and has less impact on the U-O bonding. Consistently, the uranium -oxygen symmetrical stretching frequency is higher than in the chloride complex and close to the bare uranyl value. For [UO 2 Br 4 ] 2we estimate a shift of frequencies between the ground and excited state equal to 6, 2, 31 and 53 cm −1 for ν U−Br , ν b , ν s and ν a , respectively.",

However, the absolute orientations of spins in coordinate space can be crucial in understanding the magnetic properties of materials with unpaired electrons. At a low temperature the spins of a magnetic solid may undergo a long-range magnetic ordering, which allows one to determine the directions and magnitudes of spin moments by neutron diffraction refinements. The preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion can be predicted on the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations including electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, most chemists and physicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated spin orientations are related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. This is true even for most crystallographers who determine the directions and magnitudes of spin moments because, for them, they are merely the parameters needed for the diffraction refinements. The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework of thinking about and predicting the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion by examining the relationship between the spin orientation and the local electronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion M (i.e., an ion possessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with main-group ligand atoms L to form an MLn polyhedron, where n is typically 2 -6, and the d-states",

We note that the nature of the GHF solution for the C 20 ring isomer (not shown) is trully collinear, anti-ferromagnetic in character, coinciding with a UHF-type description. In other words, an axial spin-density wave, with alternating up-and down-spins, develops along the ring.\n\nBoth the bowl and the pentagon C 20 isomers display a non-collinear structure, as depicted in Fig. 3. In both isomers a torsional wave develops in order to minimize spin frustrations, even if the nearest-neighbor interactions remain mostly anti-ferromagnetic in character. Interestingly, all the atomic moments in the bowl isomer are coplanar, with an enhanced spin density in the outermost carbon atoms. For the pentagon isomer, each acetylene-like unit along the edges has spins with a perfect anti-ferromagnetic alignment. Although the magnitudes of the magnetic moments displayed cannot be given a meaningful physical interpretation due to the known problems associated with the Mulliken population analysis [58], it is interesting that the magnetic moments in the pentagon isomer are ≈ 1/2 in magnitude, the spin of a single electron.

Assuming a non-magnetic configuration means that the spin degeneracy is enforced for all species. Of course, such a configuration should not be confused with a paramagnet, which could be simulated either by a supercell calculation with random spin orientations or by calling for disordered local moment approaches based on the coherent potential CPA approximation 24 or the LDA+DMFT scheme. 25,26 Subsequent spin-polarized calculations with different initial spin populations can lead at self-consistency either to finite or zero local moments within an implicit long range ferromagnetic order. They allow to confirm trends established within the mean-field analysis. Antiferromagnetic (AF) calculations can be carried out to test for the AF ground state. This can be done for instance by enforcing an up-spin orientation for half of the crystallographic sites and a down-spin orientation for the other half thus creating two magnetic substructures. Such a procedure is followed here to identify the AF ground state of CeRuSn, which contains four formula units per cell.\n\n\nC. Assessment of chemical bonding properties\n\nTo extract more information about the nature of the interactions between the atomic constituents from electronic structure calculations, the crystal orbital overlap population (COOP) 27 or the crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) 28 may be employed. The latter has been already used to study chemical bonding in CeRhSn. 2 While both the COOP and COHP approaches provide a qualitative description of the bonding, nonbonding, and antibonding interactions between two atoms, the COOP description in some cases exaggerates the magnitude of antibonding states. A slight refinement was recently proposed in form of the so-called covalent bond energy E cov , which combines the COHP and COOP to calculate quantities independent of the particular choice of the potential zero. 29 In the present work this covalent bond energy was used for the chemical bonding analysis. In the plots, negative, positive and zero magnitudes of E cov are indicative of bonding, antibonding, and nonbonding interactions respectively.\n\n\nIV. RESULTS FOR NON MAGNETIC CONFIGURATIONS\n\nA.

We use the orbital field (OR) scheme introduced by Brooks 31 as well as Sandratskii and Kübler 32 , which helped to account for the experimental moments within formerly studied Ce intermetallic systems 33,34 . The trend is that the magnitude of the orbital moment (L) is close to that of the spin-only (SO) moment but with opposite signs, in agreement with Hund's 3rd rule. The L moment of cerium stems from a 4f (Ce2) occupation of ∼ 1.3 electrons whose orbital moment (∼ 2.5µ B ) comes close to the one of an atomic orbital, namely 3µ B as expected from Hund's 2nd rule. This reflects an atomic-like character of the 4f (Ce) subshell. A resulting ordered LS moment of cerium of ∼ 2µ B is then obtained; it should be confronted with experimental magnitudes of magnetization from neutron diffraction when the results are made available. Lastly, in order to check for the ground state, AF calculations were carried out. At self consistency, ∆E = −2.3 meV in favor of antiferromagnetic ordering was obtained thus pointing to an antiferromagnetic ground state in agreement with the experiment. The moment carried by Ce2 is ±0.39µ B , slightly smaller than in the ferromagnetic configuration.

Compared to Mn 12acetate and Mn 4 dimers, the Ni 4 molecular magnets need much finer mesh for faster convergence of total energy. Five different Ni 4 molecules are taken into account in density-functional calculations: a tBuEtOH complex and two crystallographically inequivalent molecules of To investigate what may cause the discrepancy between theory and experiment, we calculate the magnetic moment captured by each atom, the electronic density of states projected on individual atom, and the spin-flip energy gaps for the M s = 4 configuration. Within a sphere   (Table II). Interestingly, for the M s = 0 configuration, a bridging O anion in Ni 4 bears a moment of 0.073 µ B within a sphere of 1.2 bohr radius. From the calculated electronic density of states (Fig. 2) projected onto Ni 3d orbitals for M s = 4, we find that most of the electron spin density is localized at the Ni sites. Notice that some of the oxygen 2p orbitals for minority spin are not occupied, although all majority-spin O 2p orbitals are occupied. This might imply a possible small leakage of spin density to the O sites. However, more scrutinized studies are required to conclude that this, in fact, attributes to the antiferromagnetic coupling in the calculated lowest-energy state. Another intriguing point is that as shown in Table I, collinear spin excitations for Ni 4 have an order of magnitude lower energies than those for the Mn 12 -acetate 14 and Mn 4 monomer 15,16 .

This would correspond to the appearance of additional magnon branches in the frozen spin wave calculations. Clearly, this scenario can be sorted out from the beginning, because both La/Ba and oxygen moments are induced by the hybridization with the Mn sites and cannot be totally independent from the latter.\n\n2. The contribution of La/Ba and oxygen states is purely electronic, which implies that these degrees of freedom are \"fast\" and selfconsistently follow the distribution of the spin magnetic moments at the Mn sites. This would roughly correspond to the relaxed constraint conditions in the spin-wave calculations shown in Fig. 10.\n\n3. An intermediate situation when the electronic degrees of freedom at the La/Ba and oxygen sites are not \"sufficiently fast\" so that the magnon dispersion shall be averaged over several intermediate configurations of the La/Ba and oxygen spins. This is the most interesting scenario, which is however only a speculation. If true, the magnon dispersion in FM manganites should have an intrinsic bandwidth, which should be of the same order of magnitude as the difference between \"rigid\" and \"relaxed\" calculations shown in Fig. 10. In fact, the strong magnon broadening has been observed experimentally in several FM manganites [58], though it is of course premature to make a direct connection between this broadening and the behavior of La/Ba and oxygen states considered in this section.\n\n• The non-collinear distribution of magnetic moments at the La/Ba and oxygen sites can interfere with other (extrinsic) factors, such as randomness effects caused by the cation disorder. Then, the chemical disorder may lead to the orientational spin disorder at the La/Ba and oxygen sites, which may also contribute to the magnon broadening associated with the randomness [59].\n\n\nDouble Perovskites",

[50] have discovered a drastic violation of the Curie law in Na 2 V 3 O 7 in the experimentally measured temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility. Analysis of the χ(T) dependence in terms of the Curie law shows that the effective moment of the V 4+ ion is reduced by the one order of magnitude upon reducing the temperature from 100 to 10 K. Gavilano et al. have provided an explanation that \"The reduction of the effective magnetic moment is most likely due to a gradual process of moment compensation via the formation of singlet spin configurations with most but not all of the ions taking part in this process. This may be the result of antiferromagnetic interactions and geometrical frustration.\" Using some crystallographic-arrangement arguments they further conjectured \"the compensation of eight out of the nine V spins ...\" in order to reproduce the observed reduction of the effective moment by one order of magnitude. There is no sign of the magnetic order down to 1.9 K [50]. So we have to accept that Na 2 V 3 O 7 is in the paramagnetic state down to this temperature.\n\nWe could reproduce very well the observed temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibility by considering the electronic structure associated with the V 4+ ion (3d 1 configuration) under the action of the crystal field taking into account the spin-orbit coupling. Despite of the Kramers doublet ground state, a groundstate with quite small magnetic moment is obtained as an effect of the spin-orbit coupling. It turns out that even weak s-o coupling unquenches a quite large orbital moment. In our explanation we have been oriented by our earlier calculations for the V 4+ ion presented in Refs [51].",

We utilize a first-principle pseudopotential density functional theory and local spin density approximation (LSDA) based approach. Our results show that the shape of the Fermi surface for the doped CH AFM spin-configuration is consistent with the experimentally observed one. We study the evolution of the electronic structure from the NM to the AFM cases under magnetization constraints on Fe atoms. Constrained magnetization-based estimates show that the transfer of magnetic moment between Fe atoms induces a larger bandstructure shift than the case when magnetic moments are increased. The strength of the magnon-induced energy shifts is up to one order of magnitude larger then a typical value for an energy shift caused by phonons.

The zeroenergy states are spatially segregated in the two triangular parts of the molecule (Wang et al., 2009a). To satisfy the spin-singlet ground state, the two zero-energy states have to be populated by two electrons with oppositely oriented spins. In other words, the ground electronic configuration breaks spin-spatial symmetry and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering. This result can be verified by mean-field Hubbard model calculations as shown in Figure 5(b). It can be argued that this example violates Hund's rule. However, one has to keep in mind that each of the two non-bonding states is localized within one of the graphene sublattices. That is, there are two electronic sub-bands, each populated by electrons according to Hund's rule.

Within the Stoner model, a nonmagnetic state above the Curie temperature T c would be characterized by the vanishing of the local moments in magnitude. It is well-known and universally accepted that the neglect of the transversal spin fluctuations in the Stoner model leads to an unphysical picture of the nonmagnetic state and a gross overestimate of T c . An alternate description of the nonmagnetic state is provided by the disordered local moment (DLM) model, where the local moments remain nonzero in magnitude above T c , but disorder in magnitude as well as their direction above T c causes the global magnetic moment to vanish. Combining aspects of the Stoner model and an itinerant Heisenberg-like model, Heine and co-workers 28,29 have developed a suitable criterion for a DLM state to be a more appropriate description of the nonmagnetic state than what is given by the Stoner model. Within the collinear magnetic model, where all local axes of spin-quantization point in the same direction, DLM can be treated as a binary alloy problem and thus described using the coherent potential approximation (CPA). [30][31][32][33] We have carried out such DLM calculations, assuming the Cr-sublattice to be randomly occupied by an equal number of Cr atoms with oppositely directed magnetic moments. The object for performing the DLM calculations is two-fold. If the total energy in a DLM calculation is lower than the corresponding FM calculation, we can safely assume that the ground state (for the given lattice parameter and structure) is not FM, albeit of unknown magnetic structure. The exchange interactions in the DLM state can also be used to compute estimates of T c , and such estimates of T c may be considered as estimates from above the magnetic-nonmagnetic transition. T c computed from exchange interactions in the FM state are estimates from below the transition. Of course, if the ground state is known to be ferromagnetic, then estimates of T c based on exchange interactions in the FM reference state are the appropriate ones to consider.",

At zero temperature (ground state) one can express the total energy of the spin system resulting from the exchange and kinetic energies counted from a non-magnetic state as\nE = 1 2 [ m 2 n(EF ) ][1−In(E F )].\nHere I is the Stoner exchangecorrelation integral, which is an atomic quantity derived from spin-polarized scalar-relativistic calculations 31 , and n(E F ) is the DOS at E F in the non-magnetic state. From this expression, the product In(E F ) provides a criterion for the stability of the spin system: A spinpolarized configuration (unequal spin occupation) will be more favourable if In(E F ) > 1. The system then stabilizes through a gain of exchange energy. From the calculations we have for n(E F ) for Ce1, Ce2 in CeRuSn and Ce in the rhodium based stannide 11, 98, and 39 states per Ryd, respectively. To analyze these results we use the Stoner integral for Ce as obtained from former scalar-relativistic calculations 33 : I(Ce4f ) ∼ 0.02 Ryd. The resulting Stoner products In(E F ) for Ce1, Ce2 and Ce are, respectively, 0.22, 1.96 and 0.78. The Stoner criterion is obeyed only for Ce2, which should carry a magnetic moment within CeRuSn when spin polarized calculations are carried out. This agrees with its trivalent character versus the intermediate valent character of Ce1. Still, the rather large magnitude of In(E F ) for Ce in CeRhSn points to a tendency towards a magnetic instability. However, according to the experiment CeRhSn is an intermediate-valence ternary stannide. For this reason, no ordered magnetic moment should develop when spin polarization is allowed for.

The volume of the spheres has to be equal to the cell volume because the wave equation is solved only in the spheres. This is unproblematic for closely packed structures like metals and intermetallics such as ScFe 2 itself. But for less compacked structures such as that of ScFe 2 H 2 studied here, additional augmentation spheres, called empty spheres (ES) are introduced to represent the interstitial space without loss of crystal symmetry and to avoid an otherwise too large overlap between the actual atomic spheres. ES are \"pseudo atoms\" with zero atomic number. They receive charges from the neighboring atomic species and allow for possible covalency effects within the lattice. Within the ASW method, the sphere geometry optimization (SGO) 24 algorithm is used to generate ES without symmetry breaking. For ScFe 2 H 2 one type of ES has been added. In total, 12 ES have been inserted into the Sc 4 Fe 8 H 8 structure. Besides obtaining the electronic band structure with site projected density of states (PDOS) for total spins (non spin polarized NSP configuration), as well as the spinresolved PDOS, the calculations allow discussing quantities such as the magnetic moments and their sign, the magnitude of the exchange splitting, as well as the spin densities at the core due to the ns polarization thanks to the d magnetic moment. These lead to the Fermi contact term of the hyperfine field H F C which constitutes the major part of the hyperfine field obtained by 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy.The calculations are started by assuming a non-magnetic configuration meaning a spin degeneracy for all valence states and equal spin occupations. Such a configuration should not be confused with a paramagnet, which could be simulated either by a supercell calculation with random spin orientations or by calling for disordered local moment approaches based on the coherent potential CPA approximation 34 or the LDA+DMFT scheme. 35 Subsequent spin-polarized calculations with different initial spin populations can lead at self-consistency either to finite or zero local moments within an implicit long-range ferromagnetic order.",

Different values of the energy of magnetic interaction correspond to the values of the different mutual orientations of electron and nuclear spin.\n\nThe direct determination of the nuclear moments of atoms with unpaired electrons is challenging due to the strong magnetic field at the nucleus caused by these electrons. On the other hand this is advantageous, e.g., to obtain sensitively detailed information about the paramagnetism of the respective sample by means of the magnetic resonance in the GHz range [50,[53][54][55][56][57]. Nevertheless it has to be considered that exchange interactions [36] average out the hyperfine structure on magnetically undiluted samples [51].\n\nIf the nucleus of an atom in a paramagnetic system has a magnetic moment a magnetic field of some mT will result that acts upon the electrons. The magnitude of the field depends on the orientation of the nucleus, which is usually fixed during electronic transitions. Therefore any transition (or the respective spectral line) will split in 2 I + 1 components. It has to be mentioned that the field strength of ESR at about 10 GHz is about 0.3 T and does not have a strong influence on the orientation of the nuclear moments. Thus the nuclear magnetic moment or the nuclear spin of the respective nucleus can be identified. Gorter [58] developed the hypothesis that beside 0 B  the nuclear magnetic moment plays a role on splitting the ground state of paramagnetic systems. At the nucleus that field should have a magnitude of some 10,000 mT and should cause a hyperfine splitting larger than 0.01 cm −1 . Penrose [59] delivered the first successful experimental proof of the ESR hyperfine structure. The coupling constant of the hyperfine structure of paramagnetic systems is one of the most important parameters in ESR and from the very beginning it is connected to the different action of isotopes (e.g., 63 Cu and 65 Cu) [59][60][61][62].",

As shown in Figure 2 (b), all the Mn(3d) majority spin states are occupied, while all the minority spin states remain empty, and none of them hybridize appreciable with the TCNQ LUMO [see the inset]. Additionally, the TCNQ LUMO is fully occupied due to a large electron transfer from the Mn atoms of practically two electrons and, therefore, the DOS at the Fermi level is negligible, i.e., the system is insulating. The spin magnetic moments are localized on the Mn atoms, as shown in Figure 3   Now we turn to the analysis of the coupling between the magnetic moments of the Ni and Mn atoms in their corresponding networks. We start by doing DFT calculations in a double size (2x1) supercell that contains two metal atoms in a checker-board configuration, so that we can treat both parallel (FM) and antiparallel (AFM) alignment of spins. For the Ni-TCNQ network we find that the FM configuration is energetically favored by 105.7 meV, while for the Mn-TCNQ network the AFM configuration is more favorable by 8.75 meV, per surface unit cell (2x1). Taking into account that the Mn atoms spin magnetic moment is five times larger than that of the Ni atoms, we see that the coupling in the Mn-TCNQ system is two orders of magnitude smaller, and of opposite sign, as compared with Ni-TCNQ. The corresponding spin densities are shown in Figure 3 (a) and 3 (b) for Ni-TCNQ and Mn-TCNQ, respectively, exhibiting rather different behavior.

However, if theν e spin and the 14 N spin are aligned, conservation of angular momentum will require one additional unit of angular momentum to come from either theν e or the e + wave function in order for the total angular momentum on the right-hand side to equal the 3/2 on the left-hand side. This is known from basic nuclear physics  to introduce roughly an order of magnitude smaller cross section for the latter case compared to the former. However, this also introduces a parity change. Since the transition from 14 N to the 14 C ground state is between nuclear states of the same parity, two units of angular momentum must therefore come from the anti-neutrino and/or positron wave functions. Thus the inhibition may be closer to two orders of magnitude. This spin-dependent reaction probability is the origin of the effect predicted for the SNAAP model.\n\nDetailed quantum molecular calculations (Famiano et al., 2018a,b) have shown that the complex interactions of the molecules with the intense magnetic field of a neutron star or a two neutron star merger and the effective electric field caused by the motion of the meteoroids through the magnetic field, a result of the Lorentz force, do produce an environment that is truly chiral (Barron, 2008). In this situation, the interaction of the 14 N nuclei with theν e s is chirally selective, and will in many cases, destroy more of the right-handed amino acids than the left-handed ones .\n\nThe external magnetic field aligns the 14 N nuclei via their nuclear magnetic moments, whereas the effective electric field aligns the molecular electric dipole moments, which depend on the chirality. The external magnetic field, however, is modified at the nucleus by the effects of the orbital electrons, known as shielding.\n\nThis, in turn causes a chirality sensitive perturbation on the magnetic orientation of the nuclei, which leads to a chirality-dependent magnetization (a bulk property).",

The result is presented in Fig. 4. There, only one atom of each kind is involved. As a consequence, the absolute E cov values are smaller than in Fig. 3. The major interactions in the two subsystems occur clearly for Ce-Ru, which is bonding throughout the VB but with twice larger intensity for Ce1 than for Ce2. This follows from the relative distances whereby 233 < d Ce1−Ru < 246 pm while 288 < d Ce2−Ru < 291 pm. This is concomitant with the different behavior of the two cerium sites as discussed above. The larger Ce2-Ru separation leads to a stronger localization of Ce2 states, which fact is favorable for the onset of an atomic magnetic moment. We also note that the Ce-Rh separation is even larger (d Ce−Rh ∼ 307 pm) in CeRhSn. The antibonding peak above the Fermi level just like in the Rh based system is in line with the magnetic instability of Ce2. Finally, albeit with a much smaller magnitude, the Ce-Sn interaction is bonding throughout the VB and should contribute to the bonding within the system.\n\n\nV.

According to these calculations, electrons form a bound state around the impurity site and the magnitude of the local moment is enhanced, as observed experimentally [45,34].

Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) have shown that this system has preferred outof-plane magnetization with a splitting between ground-state and first excited state of 14 meV at zero external magnetic field, corresponding to the zero-field split (ZFS) measured by IETS (selection rule ∆S = 0, ±1). 2,43 The orbital moment is unquenched and large which leads to an effective g-factor of 2.6, significantly larger than the g-factor for a free electron of 2.0. 2,43 We perform multiplet calculations on a reduced basis including 6 orbitals on the adatom and 20 surface orbitals (N W = 26). The Coulomb interaction is parametrized by an average repulsion U eff = U − J = 5 eV. We consider N e = 9 electrons in the phase space with a final electron occupation of 4s 2 3d 6 for the adatom and one remaining electron on the surface. The results of our calculation are shown in Figure 5. The calculated spectrum is in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. The IETS ZFS of 14 meV, the MAE of 21 meV, as well as the unquenched orbital moment L z are on top of the experimental values. 42 The unquenched orbital moment leads to an effective g-factor of 2.56 in our calculation. The splitting between the S z = ±2 states implies the presence of a small quantum spin tunneling (QST), which leads to a null average magnetization at zero field. The magnitude of the QST only slowly decreases with the basis size which is why the calculated value exceeds the experimentally found value of approximately 1 neV. 44 We also calculated the expectation values for S z and L z (details on the calculation of observables from the multiplet model can be found in the appendix) for in-plane and out-of-plane external magnetic field. As shown in Figure 5 (b) and (c) they quickly saturate for out-of-plane (indicated by b=z) magnetic field which confirms the preferred out-of-plane magnetization axis.

The spins may lose energy and return to a lower energy state, restoring the population imbalance and net magnetization along the field. This process is known as spin-lattice relaxation because the energy is lost to the surroundings and it has a characteristic time conventionally denoted T 1 . A return to the state of thermal equilibrium is also accompanied by a loss of magnetization in the plane perpendicular to the field. This process requires dephasing of the magnetic moments and is referred to as spin-spin relaxation. In this process, the precession of individual magnetic moments is affected by local magnetic fields due to neighboring magnetic moments. This interaction leads to dephasing with the characteristic time denoted T 2 . In general, T 1 is about an order of magnitude slower than T 2 .\n\nA strength of the signal in MRI is determined by the magnitude of the net magnetization vector created by the radiofrequency pulse. Tissues, in which this vector is large, appear white in the images. On the contrary, tissues with a weak response to the radiofrequency pulse, appear dark. Furthermore, important data may be obtained by collecting T 1 and T 2 weighted images separately. Typically, water and lipid molecules represent two extreme cases with respect to the decay times. The differences arise due to structural peculiarities of the molecules. Hydrogen atoms in water are linked to an electronegative oxygen which withdraws electrons leaving the hydrogen nuclei less shielded and, therefore, more susceptible to the external magnetic field. Furthermore, water is a small molecule with a wide range of vibrational frequencies. As a result, only a small fraction of water hydrogen nuclei may effectively transfer energy to the molecular lattice, leading to long T 1 relaxation times for water. On the contrary, hydrogen atoms in lipids are connected to electroneutral carbon atoms that do not deplete their electron density. When placed in an external magnetic field, these electrons act as a shield. Lipid molecules in tissues are tightly packed; their bonds vibrate at frequencies close to the Larmor frequency of the magnetic moments, thus, making the process of losing energy to the molecular lattice effective, which manifests itself in short T 1 relaxation times.",

Furthermore, in the energy spectra of both models, the quartet level appears as a second excited level. In this regard, both models describe reasonably well the two ground state transitions with intensities given by (6), (7) and shown in Figures 3 and 4 with solid lines. Since for all T, the difference in the values of p 0 T obtained via the spin-sigma and Heisenberg Hamiltonians is negligible, both models predict the same magnitudes for each integrated intensity, see (6) and (7). Nevertheless, only the energy spectrum (2) accounts for the existence of a third excited level and therefore explains the appearance of the high temperature magnetic excitation. The high scattering probability related to the magnitude of the third peak is reproduced only by accounting for the probability of observing a transition from quartet non-magnetic states such as the spin-quadrupole ones [31][32][33][34][35]. The respective intensity is given by (8). On the other hand, the spectrum (4) does not account for the contribution of electrons' orbital moments to the system's energy. Therefore, in the presence of an external magnetic field the Heisenberg model fails to explain the observed dc magnetization and susceptibility measurements. While the spin-sigma model provides a good qualitative and quantitative description of these properties, see Figures 5 and 6.

Thus, the redistribution of charge densities over water molecules balances the magnitudes of the magnetic moments between the two Fe atoms in the nanoclays.Additionally, the presence of water tends to reduce the spin polarization of the AA molecules, resulting in both up and down spin components localized on different parts of the AA molecules interacting with various nanoclay configurations, independent of their magnetic order, as depicted in Figure 11.However, there are exceptions, such as AA3 interacting with all nanoclay configurations and AA1 interacting with the Sc1 nanoclay.In these cases, the spin density of the AA molecule remains polarized, with a dominant spin-up contribution, although not as strongly as in the vacuum.The reduced spin polarization of the AA molecules is attributed to the magnetic moment induced on the nearest water molecules, as illustrated in Figure 11 and quantitatively presented in Table 1.The additional effect of water on the nanoclays with adsorbed AA molecules is to enhance the total magnetic moment of the nanoclay configurations exhibiting the FM order, as indicated in Table 1.This increase in magnetic moment is more pronounced for interacting AA3 and",

In the case of the ZnO nanoribbons, the sulfur atoms or thiol groups were attached in different ways to the zinc or oxygen atoms located at the edges, whereas in clusters, the sulfur atoms were set on the surface, mainly interacting with atoms with low-coordinate number. After an exhaustive atomic relaxation, we found that a magnetic moment emerges in zigzag nanoribbons both with and without sulfur-passivation on the edges. However, the magnitude of the magnetic moment is very sensitive to sulfur passivation. In particular, we found that when sulfur is attached to the zinc atoms in an alternating fashion along the ribbon edges, the magnetic moment is a maximum (1.4 μ B /unit cell). In the case of clusters, we found that the Zn 15 O 15 cluster exhibits a high spin moment of 5.5 μ B when capped with sulfur atoms. Our calculations indicate that sulfur-passivating of ZnO nanosystems could be responsible for recently observed ferromagnetic responses.\n\nIntroduction",

The magnetic moment at the B site increases linearly from Ti to Mn compounds such that the total magnetic moment follows the Slater-Pauling rule. With an increasing number of valence electrons, the magnetic moment increases linearly up to Mn and after that it deviates from this trend. At least for high magnetic moment compounds one should consider on-site electron-electron correlation. In the Co 2 BSi series, the trends are the same as in the previously discussed Al series. The only difference is the detail of the magnetic moments at Co and B atoms. The increase of the magnetic moments is attributed to the rearrangement of the electrons (discussed briefly in the next section). In summary the Co atoms contribute 1 µ B and drive the properties of the B atoms to have a magnetic moment according to the number of valence electrons of the compounds. The properties of the Co 2 BC compounds are dominated by the nature of the Co atoms which force the extent of localization of the electrons and the resulting magnetic moment at the B site.",

Considering the symmetry of the monomer and the fact that there are two kinds of Mn spins, we recognize that there are two types of exchange interactions between Mn spins within a monomer as shown in Fig. 2. To calculate the exchange coupling constants, we assume that magnetic moments of all Mn spins are aligned along a particular direction and of Ising type. So a Mn 3+ spin can have either M z = +2 or M z = −2 and a Mn 4+ spin can have M z = +3/2 or M z = −3/2. Thus we can construct three different spin configurations other than the ground-state shown in Table 2. For example, M s = 15/2 (M s is an eigenvalue of the z component of the total spin operator S) is achieved by flipping a Mn 4+ spin from the ground-state S = 9/2: M s = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3/2 = 15/2. Notice that all of the examined spin configurations are not eigenstates of S 2 . We set up geometries of the three spin configurations using the optimized ground-state geometry with corresponding Ising-type spin arrangements and proper magnetic moments. Then we minimize self-consistently the energies of the spin configurations. Comparing the energies of the three configurations (refer to Table 2) with the energy gap between the minority LUMO and the majority HOMO, we find that the examined spin configurations have an order of magnitude smaller energy than other kinds of spin excitations such as moving one majority spin to the unoccupied minority orbital. So we call those spin configurations low-energy spin excitations. Since there are three unknowns (the background energy, E 0 , the two types of exchange constants, J 1 and J 2 ) and four equations to solve, we can calculate the exchange constants by the least-square-fit (LSF) method.

They claimed that this [2Fe-2S] cluster containing protein polymerizes and forms a ferrimagnet that is sensitive to geomagnetic field [6]. Meister calculated the magnetic moment of the Fe atoms in the IscA1 complex in the size measured in [6], and found that its interaction energy with geomagnetic field is five magnitudes smaller than kBT [7]. Winklhofer and Mouritsen pointed out that the spins of the Fe atoms in the [2Fe-2S] cluster in proteins are diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and thus in principle IscA1 or the Cry-IscA1 complex cannot be a ferrimagnet [8]. They also argued [8] that the claimed directional preference in the single-particle Cry-IscA1 complexes by electron microscopy cannot be deduced by the statistical data presented in [6]. Their calculation from the magnetization curve obtained for the Cry-IscA1 complex in solution [6] leads to a magnetic moment with geomagnetic interaction energy seven magnitudes smaller than thermal energy [8] (If the concentration of the Cry-IscA1 complex 3.8 mg/ml in solution [6] is considered, the energy is still about 10 5 smaller than kBT). Finally, there is an evident directional preference in the IscA1 crystals when applied by an external magnet [6]. We suspect that this is due to deposition of small iron oxide magnetite crystals, manifested by the tiny hairs, on the IscA1 crystals. As pointed by Meister [7], small magnetite crystals have strong magnetic moment due to high density of Fe atoms with strong exchange interaction, and can thus be very sensitive to external magnetic field.

In an itinerant antiferromagnet, there should be significant damping due to decay of the spin waves into electron-hole pairs. Measurements on CaFe 2 As 2 [148] and BaFe 2 As 2 [151] suggested that considerable damping is present in the spin wave spectrum as expected for an itinerant system. On the other hand, measurements of the full excitation spectrum in CaFe 2 As 2 are well described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian [150] with some damping (Γ ∼ 0.15 E) which they attribute to predominately local moment physics. Interestingly, despite the contradictory conclusions with respect to itineracy, the magnitude of damping extracted by McQueeney et al. [148] and Zhao et al. [150] both on CaFe 2 As 2 are largely consistent with one another. Ultimately there may well be aspects of both localized and itinerant magnetism as predicted from DFT calculations where it was suggested that the moments were local but the interactions were itinerant in nature [96].\n\n\nEvolution of the Spin Excitations\n\nWe now turn to the evolution of the spin excitations as a function of a tuning parameter.

The energy of the d orbitals is important for hybridization and the magnitude of the orbital moment, as illustrated in Figure 3. This is confirmed in our calculations, where the orbital moment of the Co site close to the manipulated ligands decreases with the number of removed methyl groups (0.311, 0.278, and 0.269 μ B for 0, 1, and 2 abstracted methyl groups, respectively), while that of the other Co site remains fairly constant (0.295, 0.302, and 0.298 μ B ).

METHOD\n\nCalculations were carried out in the framework of density-functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA). The Perdew-Zunger parametrization [6] of exchange-correlation energy was used. The nuclei and the core electrons are described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials [7] with the parameters of Ref. [8]. The Ni single atom contact was simulated by a regular monatomic Ni wire, infinite along the z axis, and periodically repeated in a square lattice along x and y. The spacing used, 8.46Å, was checked to be large enough to avoid measurable wire-wire interactions. The kinetic energy cut-offs of the plane wave basis set were 25 Ry and 300 Ry for the wave functions and the charge density, respectively. Integration of the 1D Brillouin zone was done on a uniform mesh of 80 k-points. These parameters proved sufficient to provide converged results. The integration up to the Fermi level was done by a standard broadening technique [9] with the smearing parameter of 0.002 Ry.\n\nA single Ni atom per cell is required for both nonmagnetic and ferromagnetic states. To study the state with spin reversal (actually two spin reversals with periodic boundary conditions) we extended our cell up to 8 Ni atoms. While our calculations were restricted to collinear spins thus excluding for simplicity the possibility of spin moment rotation, the magnetization magnitude and sign were allowed to vary with total freedom as a function of position. In order to find the state of lowest energy with a given total magnetization we applied the fixed-spin-moment (FSM) method [10,11], introducing two Fermi energies E ± F for different spin directions. The difference B = (E + F −E − F )/2 is a magnetic field which is needed to stabilize the state at the chosen magnetization. The stable configurations correspond to zero magnetic field (when E + F = E − F ).\n\n\nIII. FERROMAGNETIC AND NONMAGNETIC MONATOMIC WIRES",

HF theory was a simplest ab initio technique and among the first principles of quantum-chemical theories, being attained directly from the Schrodingerwave equation that did not incorporate any pragmatic contemplations. Although such theories and techniques proved beneficial, it was density functional theory (DFT) that laid a demanding theoretical foundation in 1964 by an outstanding result established by Hohenberg and Kohn [2]. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems state that the exact ground state energy of the system is produced by a unique functional of the electron density r. The first theorem demonstrates a many-particle system n(x,y,z) for which one-to-one plotting happens between the ground state electric density and the ground state wave function. The second theorem verifies that total electric energy of the system E[n(x,y,z)] is minimalized by the ground state density [3]. The work of Kohn and Sham instantly surveyed and paved the way for hands-on computational applicability of DFT to physical systems, by linking a reference-state comprising of a set of noninteracting one-particle orbitals with a particular functional. The reference orbitals determined by a set of operative one-particle Schrodinger-wave equations are called Kohn-Sham (KS) equations [4]; one of them is depicted in Eq. (1).\nÀ 1 2 ∇ 2 r ! þ V KS Ψ i ¼ ε i Ψ i(1)\nwhere V KS is a local one-body potential defined as total density of the noninteracting system and is the same as the density of a real system.\n\n\nSpectral implementations of DFT",

In naive reaction methods like DWBA or ADWA the dynamic core excitation is usually neglected, i.e., it is assumed that the bound state component |Φ x p takes no part in the reaction, and the core excitation effect is a reduction of the single-particle differential cross section by the SF. However, this conjecture on factorization may be wrong as it was demonstrated by rigorous Faddeevtype calculations using the 10 Be(d, p) 11 Be transfer to the ground state of 11 Be( 1 2 + ) as example [12][13][14]. We therefore investigate in Figs. 4 and 5 the validity of factorization conjecture for 20 O(d, p) 21 O reactions over a broader energy range.

The absolute potentials, expressed in eV, are shown bellow.SupplementaryFigure 24. Calculated redox potentials of 3e and 3g. In order to convert the absolute potentials into values comparable to experimental results, we have to compare them with the known absolute potential of a common reference electrode. The IUPAC recommended absolute potential of NHE E ⊖ (H + /H 2 ) abs value is 4.42 V. 41 Thus, redox potential for the reduction of 3e and 3g NHE are -3.28 V and -3.31V respectively. Considering that Saturated Calomel Electrode has a potential of +0.244 V vs NHE the values of reduction potentials of our photocatalysts vs SCE are: -3.52 V for 3e and -3.55 V for 3g. Effectively, such values are too negative and definitely should fall out of the measurable range in acetonitrile solution. Estimation of redox potential from excited state arise from consideration of the energy found for S 1 .

However if the hindering potential is weak, the dipoles undergo reorientational motion (i.e. large angular jump) over and above the oscillatory motion. The reorientational motion, which involves reorientation of the dipole from one orientation to another, is a thermally activated process. The above stochastic reorientation process exhibits as a quantum mechanical rotational tunneling process at low temperatures. 10,11 The rotational tunneling gives rise to the splitting of the rotational ground state of the dipole and the magnitude of splitting energy (referred to as rotational tunneling energy) depends on the strength of the hindering potential V(θ). This splitting of ground state has been seen for K(CN) x Br 1−x , where CN − ions reorient by 180 • via quantum mechanical tunneling at low temperatures. 8,9 Neutron incoherent inelastic scattering is an excellent technique for measuring rotational tunneling states in solids.

This initial wavepacket is shown in Fig. 2 in red. The vertical excitation energy at the equilibrium position R 0 ≈ 1.4 a.u. corresponds to ω m (R 0 ) ≈ 12.75 eV, far detuned from the plasmon resonance. As the wavepacket starts oscillating and spreading on the B curve, within less than 10 fs it reaches the region where the cavity and molecular transition are on resonance. There, the coupling to the plasmonic mode leads to population transfer into the plasmonically excited surface, which almost immediately decays to the ground state. As we have recently shown, the photons emitted from a plasmonic cavity in similar setups can give direct optical access to ultrafast nuclear motion 27 . However, in the current case, the plasmonic mode is nonradiative and no photons are emitted into the far field. Nonetheless, the plasmonic decay conserves the kinetic energy accumulated by the nuclear wavepacket during its propagation on the B surface 67 . The nuclear wavepacket arriving on the ground-state surface V X (R) (shown in green at t = 10 fs in Fig. 2) can thus keep propagating, with a significant fraction overcoming the dissociation barrier. At the same time, some fraction of the wavepacket remains trapped in the bound vibrational states of V X (R), shown in brown for t = 27 fs in Fig. 2.",

The functional in DFT is the electron density, which is a function of space and time. It was described by two Hohenberg-Kohn (H-K) theorems in 1964. The first H-K theorem stated that the ground state density uniquely determines the external potential of a system because the external potential is a unique functional of electron density in the ground state, therefore the total energy is also a functional of the ground state electron density [125][126][127]. Because of this theorem, all properties of a system are calculated only from the ground state electron density. In the second H-K theorem, the total energy of a system is minimized from the correct ground state energy.\n\nThe method of computing ground-state density of a system was formulated by Kohn and Sham. The aim of the Kohn-Sham method is to calculate the ground state density as a real system by replacing a fully interacting system to a non-interacting one [128,129]. The exact ground state density of a N-electron system is calculated from the individual electron wavefunction (3):\nρ(r) = 2 ∑ ϕ i * ϕ i (r) (3)\nwhere single-particle wavefunctions, ψ, are the N lowest-energy solutions of the Kohn-Sham equations.

Some of the commonly used approximation methods include local density approximation (LDA), generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and adiabatic connection method (ACM). The selection of a suitable V XC (r) functional for a simulated system is crucial because it determines the accuracy of the DFT calculation. V H (r) = e 2 {( ρ (r ))/|r-r |} d 3 r",

It is clear that such a weak attractive force cannot account for the observed G-L critical temperature, T c = 0.151 eV, of fluid mercury.

See Supplemental Material [36] for computational details. The neutral ground state of the molecule is X 1 Σ 0 + , and its electronic configuration is [3d 10 ][σ 2 π 4 σ * 0 ]. The two ionic ground states, X 2 Π 3/2 and X 2 Π 1/2 , arise from the [3d 10 ][σ 2 π 3 σ * 0 ] configuration, and the associated spinorbit splitting is 0.328 eV [37]. In the experiments, a femtosecond pump pulse (red arrow) strong-field ionizes the molecule and launches coherent wave packets on these ionic ground potentials. After a controlled delay time t, an attosecond probe pulse (blue arrow) interrogates the 3d → π core-to-valence transitions and encodes the valence dynamics in the characteristic core-level absorption signals. The lowest core-excited states arise from the [3d 9 ][σ 2 π 4 σ * 0 ] configuration, which splits into five energy levels ( 2 ∆ 5/2 , 2 Π 3/2 , 2 Σ 1/2 , 2 ∆ 3/2 , and 2 Π 1/2 ) due to spin-orbit coupling and ligand-field effects [33,38].

Figure 8 shows the total and vibrationally resolved ICSs of Li(2p) + H 2 (X 1 Σ + g ) → LiH(X 1 Σ + ) + H reaction calculated by the S-matrix method. There are a small amount of tiny oscillations on the ICSs curves, which is different from the intense and sharp peaks on the curves of probability. It is because the resonance structure is erased by summing over all the partial waves. For the total ICSs, the threshold is 0.225 eV which is consistent with the probability for J = 0. With the collision energy increasing, the total ICSs increases and the four vibrational excitation states of product appear in the order of v′ = 1 to v′ = 4. With the collision energy increasing, the ICS of ground vibrational state increases until reaching the maximum value at collision energy of 0.505 eV. When the collision energy increases from 0.505 eV, the ICSs for the vibrational excitation states still increases, but it decreases for the ground vibrational state. Therefore, the increase of the total ICSs comes from vibrational excitation states when the collision energy is higher than 0.505 eV. Figure 9 presents the DCSs of the  Li(2p) + H 2 (X 1 Σ + g ) → LiH(X 1 Σ + ) + H reaction at three collision energies to study the angular distribution of the product LiH. As shown in the figure, the product molecule LiH tends to be forward scattering at low collision energy (0.3 eV). With the collision energy increasing, the peak at 180° appears, which implies that the trend of the backward scattering of LiH molecule becomes more and more obvious. However, the peak at 0° is still higher than that at 180°, thus the forward scattering is dominant in the title reaction.\n\n\nDiscussion",

As both effects stabilize the Pa cations, the ZORA-cGHF values are much lower than those at correlated levels of theory due this imbalanced consideration of electron-correlation effects.\n\n\nElectronic excitation energies",

The potential energies and electric dipole moments used in the calculations are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The X 1 Σ + state potential energy and dipole moment functions are based on the data of Ref.

Radiative association can occur through two main classes of mechanisms commonly called direct and resonance mediated. The difference between them is illustrated in Fig. 3 and by inspecting the potential curves in Fig. 1 we conclude that reaction (9) only can occur through direct radiative association. This is a consequence of the fact that the A 1 Π potential is purely repulsive, except for a tiny van der Waals well, and therefore it does not support any quasibound states.

We confirm the dominant contribution of 2 Π u symmetry in both processes starting from v = 0. Both cross sections however increase rapidly with increase in the vibrational excitation of the molecule and for these vibrationally excited states it is necessary to consider the contributions from all four of the low-lying O − 2 resonance states. Finally, Fig. 5 compares cross sections for different resonant processes involving electron-O 2 (X 3 Σ − g , v) scattering: our previous results for v → v + 1 vibrationalexcitation [4], with the present cross sections for DEA and EID for the cases when the O 2 is initially in its vibra- tional ground state and in its v = 20 state. For the v = 0 level vibrational excitation is the dominant low-energy process. However for vibrationally excited molecules the DEA increases rapidly and becomes much the most important process at low energies. We expect that the inclusion of these results will have important consequences in models of plasmas containing molecular oxygen and, in particular, will lead to a significant increase in O − ion production in these models.\n\nRecently, we have calculated also the rate coefficients for the processes (1) and (2) as a function of the electronic temperature and for all the vibrational levels.

Abnormalities in theta-gamma coupling have been thus suggested as a possible electrophysiological substrate of disordered thoughts and impaired working memory 8,38 . Also, it should be noted that recent CFC studies have demonstrated that theta modulates multiple higher frequency bands, which occur within (30-100 Hz) and beyond (.100 Hz) the traditional gamma band [22][23][24]39 . For instance, theta preferentially modulates high-gamma (60-100 Hz) in CA1 and low-gamma (30-60 Hz) in CA3 22,24,40 . Additionally, theta phase also modulates higher frequency activity circumscribed into the 110-160 Hz band in stratum oriens-alveus 23,39 , which we refer to as HFO. Interestingly, ketamine leads to a significant increase in HFO activity in the nucleus accumbens 28 , a limbic region implicated in schizophrenia that receives massive connections from the hippocampus 41 . This suggests that higher frequency oscillations above the gamma range may also be altered in schizophrenia.  Here we showed that ketamine increases theta-HFO coupling during peak locomotion at all doses studied, while its effect on theta-gamma coupling was dose dependent. Importantly, none of these effects can be explained by changes in theta power occurring during hyperlocomotion. The cognitive implications of increased theta-HFO coupling remain to be better understood, as well as the functional role of HFO per se 23,28,39 . A recent study has shown that physiological theta-HFO coupling significantly increases during REM sleep 31 . REM sleep is a brain state associated with incongruous thoughts and dreams. Many similarities have been pointed out between REM sleep and psychosis 42 , leading some to suggest that psychotic symptoms would be associated with intrusion of a dreaming state into an awake mind 43,44 . While these suggestions remain to be appropriately tested, the finding of enhanced theta-HFO coupling during REM sleep 31 and following NMDAR blockade (present results) supports such a view.",

NMDAR involvement of LEV-induced theta may be explained by the observation that LEV increased selectively NMDA-induced glutamate release [29]. LEV specifically binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), which is widely expressed in different brain regions. Interestingly, SV2A is a only subtype of the SV2 family expressed in GABAergic neurons [31] and is implicated in the control of GABA release [32]. a potent activator of extrasynaptic GABA A receptors [33, 34]. Extrasynaptic GABA A R may down-regulate theta oscillation, as extrasynaptic GABA A R-mediated tonic inhibition counteracts the excitation of interneurons and down-regulate network oscillations [35]. This may explain taurine blockage of LEV induction of theta oscillation. Thus it can infer that LEV may inhibit extrasynaptic GABA A R activation via reducing taurine level in the hippocampus [27], indirectly boost GABA action and contribute to the theta oscillations. In this study LEV-induced theta oscillation was partially blocked by atropine but not affected by nAChR antagonist, indicating that mAChR but not nAChR was involved in the regulation of LEV-induced theta, although nAChR agonist nicotine induced theta oscillations in hippocampal CA3 area[22]. Our results were supported by the observation that LEV facilitated cholinergic function via mAChR activation [36]. It is likely that LEV may activate G-protein related signaling molecules including mAChR activation and NMDAR, leading to the excitation of GABAergic neurons and GABA release as well as activation of GABA A receptors within local neuronal network. Thus LEV-induced oscillation in hippocampal CA3 area is mediated by GABA A R, NMDAR and mAChR. Animal model of TLE exhibits a decrease in the power of theta oscillations correlated with spatial memory deficits [37]. LEV can improve the impaired spatial memory in the TLE rats [19], LEV induction of theta oscillation may contribute to the improvement of cognition. Thus our findings provide additional evidence to support clinical application of LEV in the neuropsychological disorders associated with impairment of theta activity. 9",

RESULTS\n\nCollapse from homogeneous self-attraction.\n\nAs a test scenario, we first considered the limit case of collapse of a simple polymer with homogeneous self-attraction (a homopolymer). In this case one expects to find the conventional theta transition, and this is the case in our simulations. To show this, we considered the swelling parameter α, defined here as the ratio of the mean end-to-end distance of the polymer R e = |r N − r 1 | in a given condition and its value R 0 = λN 1/2 at the theta point. Fig. 2A shows a plot of this quantity as a function of the homogeneous attraction energy per bead u , for polymers with increasing N . The theta point is located where the swelling parameter equals one. We verified that its position corresponds well to the prediction of the Flory mean-field theory, which defines the theta point from the balancing, in the second virial coefficient, of the excluded volume interaction term with the attraction term. In our case both terms can be estimated from the Mayer function, respectively as\nv 1 = 4 3 πσ 3 (repulsion) and v 2 = 4 3 πβ u (a 3 −σ 3 ) (attraction), with β = 1/(k B T ).\nIn our simulations, the shape of the collapse curves of the swelling parameter changes with varying excluded volume (Fig. 2), i.e. varying σ. As σ increases, the theta point correctly shifts towards larger energy values (Fig. 2B). However, for increasingly \"thin\" polymers, while the theta point still follows the predicted behavior, the inflexion point of the swelling ratio plotted as a function of u becomes very steep, and radically moves towards increasingly larger values of u instead of smaller ones. These values, and not the theta point, correspond to where the \"collapse\", intended as a major jump in the swelling ratio, effectively takes place. This phenomenology has been reported previously [49], and may correspond to a first-order transition related to polymer crystallization [50].",

The former process maintains the balance by redistributing antennae excitation between the photosystems, meanwhile the latter by dissipating excessive excitation inside the antennae. In the present study, these mechanisms have been analysed in the cryptophyte alga Guillardia theta. Photoprotective non-photochemical quenching was observed in cultures only after they had entered the stationary growth phase. These cells displayed a diminished overall photosynthetic efficiency, measured as CO 2 assimilation rate and electron transport rate. However, in the logarithmic growth phase G. theta cells redistributed excitation energy via a mechanism similar to state transitions. These state transitions were triggered by blue light absorbed by the membrane integrated chlorophyll a/c antennae, and green light absorbed by the lumenal biliproteins was ineffective. It is proposed that state transitions in G. theta are induced by small re-arrangements of the intrinsic antennae proteins, resulting in their coupling/uncoupling to the photosystems in state 1 or state 2, respectively. G. theta therefore represents a chromalveolate algae able to perform state transitions.\n\nIntroduction",

Power at each time point was averaged across the frequency range to obtain time-varying estimates of oscillatory power. Time points were collected when the power exceeded 2 SD of the time-averaged power. Time windows, 160 ms in length, were cut around the identified time points.\n\nIn each 160-ms segment, the maxima of gamma oscillatory amplitude were determined from the gamma bandpass filtered versions of the recordings. Duplicated gamma oscillatory periods, a common consequence of extracting overlapping time windows, were avoided by discarding identical maxima values within a given gamma oscillatory subtype and further requiring that maxima of a given subtype be separated by at least 100 ms. Individual gamma oscillatory windows were finally constructed from the original, non-bandpass filtered recordings as 400 ms long windows centered around the gamma oscillatory amplitude maxima.\n\n\nRelationship of gamma to theta phase\n\nLFP recordings were bandpass-filtered in the theta range (2.5-4.5 Hz), and theta phases for each time point were estimated using the Hilbert transform function from the Signal Processing Toolbox in MATLAB. Theta phases at the time points associated with gamma maxima (determined as described above) as well as theta phases for spikes were collected.

Indeed, the sum of our cross sections for double and triple detachment of O − at 535 eV amounts to 0.43 ± 0.07 Mb and agrees well with the cross section for nonresonant K-shell absorption in neutral oxygen of 0.5 Mb [20]. Similar values were measured for photoabsorption of O + and O 2+ [21]. In this comparison it is assumed that direct K-shell ionization is followed by one or more Auger decays rather than radiative transitions and that, therefore, the absorption cross section can be well approximated by the sum of the cross sections for double and triple detachment. The lowest threshold for K-shell ionization is associated with the 1s 2s 2 2p 5 3 P 2 K-vacancy level. The next higher thresholds are the 3 P 1 and 3 P 0 thresholds at calculated energies of 0.035 and 0.064 eV above the 3 P 2 levels. This small splitting is not resolved in the data of Fig. 1 due to the much larger energy spread ∆E = 0.36 eV of the incident photons. However, the next higher threshold, i. e., the 1s 2s 2 2p 5 1 P 1 threshold (2.87 eV above the 3 P 0 threshold) is clearly observed in the triple-detachment channel. No hint of this threshold was seen by Gibson et al. [14] probably because an even larger photon energy spread was used in their experiment. For a more accurate determination of the threshold energies we have fitted step functions that were convoluted with a gaussian to the experimental data, and this gives rise to the threshold energies 529.56±0.07 eV and 532.13±0.40 eV for the 1s 2s 2 2p 5 3 P and 1s 2s 2 2p 5 1 P thresholds, respectively.

To that end, we plotted mean CFC strength as a function of the theta/delta power ratio (Fig. 7a, b). We note that due to the spectral leakage of delta power into the theta rage that occurs during periods of immobility (c.f. section above), the theta/delta ratio is a better measure of genuine theta activity in the LFP than the mean power in the theta range. Moreover, the theta/ delta ratio is a spectral measure highly correlated with locomotion speed ( Supplementary Fig. S2 online), and thus also serves to investigate whether changes in CFC strength are explained by changes in locomotion. We found that ketamine altered CFC in a similar way as described above even after controlling for this confounding factor (see Fig. 7c for multiple regression analyses).

Since the dielectric constant of the solvent remains virtually constant during the chain collapse, the counterion binding is entirely caused by the reduction in the polyion chain dimension. Remarkably the counterion binding occurs already well above the theta dimension of the polyion which was also reported for the Sr 2+ induced collapse of sodium polyacrylate (NaPA) in aqueous sodium chloride solution. 58 The theory of uniform collapse induced by concomitant counterion binding agrees quantitatively with the location of the phase boundary, but does not properly reproduce the width of the transition as mentioned above. Besides possible anisotropic chain conformations specific ion-solvation effects could also be the origin of the observed discrepancy.\n\nFuture work will focus on the variation of the degree of quaternization as well as on the influence of the molar mass and of the chemical charge density, particularly at high charge.\n\n\na system specific parameter.

The band gap evaluation inFigure 3bgives a value of 3.21 eV for sample prepared at 500 °C, which corresponds well with values for the indirect band gap of anatase. However, for samples prepared at 800 °C and 900 °C, the band gap evaluation leads to an increasingly lower value of 3.15 eV for 800 °C 3.00 eV for states close to the conduction band of anatase.40,41 To explain the beneficial effect of an anatase/Ti4O7 junction on the photocatalytic hydrogen generation one may consider previous theoretical work on the electronic structure of Magnéli phases and namely Ti4O7.37,41 At room temperature, DOS calculations for Ti4O7 show a metallic band of a width of approx. 0.5 eV that consists of 3d Ti states with a formal Ti +3.5 charge. The electron hopping activation energies to move an electron from a Ti 3+ to a neighboring Ti 4+ is < 0.2 eV (i.e. sufficient to provide room temperature conductivity). The Fermi level of this metallic band, in absolute energy, is located approx. 0.1 -0.2 eV below the conduction band of anatase. The energetic situation of an anatase/Ti4O7 junction can thus roughly be outlined as shown inFigure 3c. From these considerations, one can deduce Ti4O7 to act as a charge transfer mediator for photogenerated electrons (similar to a noble metal co-catalyst). Anatase, to a large extent, acts as the carrier harvesting phase whereas the Ti4O7 extracts electrons and mediates their transfer to the surrounding liquid phase. Due to the close proximity of anatase and Magnéli phase (in a single particle), charge carrier separation can be very efficient. Additionally, the Magnéli phase provides a high electronic conductivity, which ensures a high carrier mobility through the co-catalyst and thus further facilitates the charge separation in the photocatalytic process.",

It is somewhat surprising that the simple simulations reported in Figures 5-7 are so successful at reproducing the Golgi cell response to brief tactile stimuli in vivo (Vos et al., 1999a;Volny-Luraghi et al., 2002). For example, the timing of Golgi cell spikes in vivo is assumed to be related to differential delays in the afferent fibers (trigeminal and cortico-pontine mossy fibers: Vos et al., 2000, see also Morissette and Bower, 1996, as well as parallel fibers: Volny-Luraghi et al., 2002;Vos et al., 2000), but in our model intrinsic mechanisms tune the response toward the appropriate spike burst. Intrinsic mechanisms also provide the substrate of the silent pause in the model, but the response lacks the subsequent rebound in activity observed in vivo (Tahon et al., 2005;Vos et al., 1999a), suggesting that the silent pause is enhanced by Golgi cell inhibition by molecular layer interneurons (Dumoulin et al., 2001;Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974). This inhibition may also explain the long-lasting depressions of firing evoked by strong electrical stimuli (Holtzman et al., 2006b). Equally interesting is the finding that Golgi cell response to repetitive stimulation is anticipated, intensified and made more precise at theta frequency. Golgi cell theta-frequency oscillation and resonance, together with theta-frequency resonance in granule cells (D'Angelo et al., 2001) may intensify and improve time precision to theta-frequency cortical inputs during certain sensory-motor behaviors, like active whisking (for review see Kleinfeld et al., 2006). Resonance, in turn, could promote the coherent oscillation of granular layer neurons observed in awake rats and monkeys (Hartmann and Bower, 1998;Pellerin and Lamarre, 1997).",

The data suggest that CDK1 is not required for CMG unloading or ICL repair. c, Left, reaction scheme of a control experiment to ensure that the addition of CDK1i in b blocked CDK1 activity. As recently described (Deng et al., in press), when replication forks are stalled at a LacR array, the subsequent addition of Cyclin B1-CDK1 promotes TRAIPdependent CMG unloading and fork breakage, alternative end joining, and the formation of aberrant replication products that migrate in the well of an agarose gel. To verify that CDK1 was effectively inhibited in a, we used this CDK1-dependent well-product formation as an assay. To this end, replication of pCTRL-lacO with a pre-assembled LacR array was initiated (−55 min) by addition of NPE. Forty-five min after initiation (−10 min), reactions were supplemented with CDK1i or buffer and allowed to incubate for an additional 10 min. Cyclin B1-CDK1 was then added to activate fork breakage and well product formation (0 min). Right, experiment described in left scheme. As expected, addition of Cyclin B1-CDK1 in the absence of CDK1i led to the formation of well products (lanes 25-30) but not in the presence of CDK1i (lanes [31][32][33][34][35][36]. Note that the experiments in b and c were performed in parallel; extracts were aliquoted for the various conditions described at 0 min. Therefore, the CDK1i effectively inhibited CDK1-dependent activation of TRAIP. We conclude that TRAIP activation at ICLs does not depend on residual CDK1 activity.   Fig. 4d).

In support of this hypothesis of a major role for steric effects, we note that the indicators of pure π electronic stability do not show any clear correlation with the computed relative energies of attachment isomers ( Table 2, Aa-Ad, Pa-Pf). For example, whilst it is true that the isomer Pb, which has the lowest all-electron energy, has a higher Kekulé count, larger π energy per electron and bigger HOMO-LUMO gap than its nearest competitor, Ab, it does not stand out on any of qualitative measures from the mass of the phenanthrenoid Figure 13.

Furthermore, we show that APP23 mice have marked alterations in theta and gamma oscillations and impaired cross-frequency gamma modulation by the phase of theta oscillations. We found markedly enhanced spike activity in APP23 after riluzole treatment. Surprisingly, we found that hypersynchronicity in APP23 mice could be enhanced by MK801 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Spectral analysis showed that enhanced hypersynchronicity in APP23 by riluzole, MK801 and SB203580 is accompanied by alterations in theta and gamma wave power. CFC analysis showed that impaired coupling strength in APP23 mice, while not altered by MK801 or SB203580 treatment, is significantly increased by riluzole (Table 1). Spontaneous hypersynchronicity, possible induced by Aβ [53], has previously been described for transgenic mouse models of AD [24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32]54]. Our study corroborates previous findings by showing spontaneous hypersynchronicity in APP23 mice, which express human APP carrying the Swedish double mutation. APP23 mice present memory deficits as early as 3 months of age [55], while plaque pathology is not seen before 6 months of age [44]. Our data show pronounced neuronal network aberrations and EEG abnormalities such as epileptiform activity, spectral power differences and CFC impairments in APP23 mice already at an age when memory deficits manifest, and well before Aβ plaque formation. This is paralleled by altered molecular signalling with hippocampal p38 activation. Neuronal networks may even be compromised before memory deficits develop, since network aberrations and hypersynchronicity have been observed in brain slices of APP-expressing TgCRND8 mice at 1 month of age [36,54]. Spectral analysis showed significantly lower interictal theta power in APP23 EEG recordings, while strength of gamma oscillations was significantly increased ( Figure 2). As outlined above, hippocampal oscillations of theta and gamma frequencies contribute to physiological processes required in memory and cognition [11][12][13]. Thus, hippocampal network aberrations leading to spectral changes in these frequency bands may underlie onset of cognitive deficits in APP23 mice [55,56]. Alternative APP-expressing mouse models show similar alterations in theta and gamma waveforms",

The HPC theta power was not significantly reduced but showed a trend to decrease ( Fig. 2F; p=0.06, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

ProtaBank provides a format to describe and compare all types of protein mutational data, spanning a wide range of properties and techniques. It features a user-friendly web interface and programming layer that streamlines data deposition and allows for batch input and queries. A suite of analysis and visualization tools are provided to facilitate discovery, to guide future designs, and to benchmark and train new predictive tools and algorithms. ProtaBank will provide a valuable resource to the protein engineering community by storing and safeguarding newly generated data, allowing for fast searching and identification of relevant data from the existing literature, and exploring correlations between disparate data sets. We demonstrate the importance of a standardized format for reporting protein engineering data that allows for accurate comparisons between different data sets and enables meta-analysis of protein sequence and function as well as future data mining and machine learning approaches. ProtaBank is available at https://protabank.org. Cells use enzymes such as DNA polymerases to maintain genomic stability during DNA repair. DNA Polymerase Theta is the predominant polymerase involved in alternative double-stranded break repair. Despite this, it is often error-prone as it does not accurately match the nucleotide on a DNA template with the correct complementary base. Studies have also found that high expression of Theta leads to increased rate of mutation in cancer cells, suggesting that Theta could be a potential cancer driver. This polymerization mechanism begins once DNA binds to Theta in the region of the thumb domain. This aligns the active site in the palm domain to incorporate the correct nucleotide opposite the template strand with the final rate-limiting step being the release of the extended DNA strand. If this mechanism is flawed, it could lead to mutations, genomic instability, and a pathway for cancer cells to avoid apoptosis. This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of Theta during DNA repair using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) in which we internally fluorescently labeled fingers domain of Theta to observe its interaction with DNA and a nucleotide. Preliminary results suggest that only in the presence of correct nucleotide does Theta experience a global conformational change during polymerization to ensure correct matching, suggesting nucleotide selection by Theta is monitored in open conformation and only when the correct pair is formed does polymerization proceed. Our FRET system can be used to further understand mutagenic incorporation pathway of Theta and",

[55] who suggested that the laser can be tuned to a magic wavelength λ magic , where lattice potentials of equal depth are produced for the two electronic states of the clock transition. At such wavelength, the AC polarizabilities of the two relevant states satisfy the condition α upper (λ) = α lower (λ). (65) Ab initio calculations of the dynamic polarizability are valuable in making an initial estimate of the magic wavelength prior to construction of the optical lattice. However, it is possible to make very precise determinations of the magic wavelength once the lattice has been constructed and atoms have been trapped since the experimental design is that of a null experiment. The experimental magic wavelength can be used as a constraint upon the dynamic polarizability and used to refine the polarizability calculation.\n\nExamples of a magic wavelength calculation are depicted in Fig. 3, where polarizabilities of the Li 2s and 3p 1/2 states obtained using RLCCSDT method are plotted. The magic wavelengths are located at the crossing points of the two curves. The ground state polarizability is nearly flat in this wavelength region, while the 3p 1/2 polarizability has several resonances noted by the vertical lines.\n\nOne of the current goals of the quantum information projects is to design an apparatus capable of interconnecting \"flying\" and \"stationary\" qubits. The ability to trap neutral atoms inside high-Q cavities in the strong coupling regime is of particular importance for such schemes. In a far-detuned optical dipole trap, the potential experienced by an atom can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the sign of the AC Stark shift due to the trap light. The excited states The magic wavelengths in Na, K, Rb, and Cs atoms for which the ns ground state and either of the first two np j excited states experience the same optical potential for state-insensitive cooling and trapping were evaluated in [29].

Attempts were made by Born and his assistants to discuss the stationary state energy levels of 'simple' non-trivial systems such as He, H + 2 , H 2 , H 2 O. The molecular species were tackled as problems in electronic structure, that is, as requiring the calculation of the energy levels for the electron(s) in the field of fixed nuclei as a calculation separate from the rotation-vibration of the molecule as a whole. Pauli gave a lengthy qualitative discussion of the possible Bohr orbits for the single electron moving in the field of two fixed protons in H + 2 but could not obtain the correct stationary states [32]. Nordheim investigated the forces between two hydrogen atoms as they approach each other adiabatically 6 in various orientations consistent with the quantum conditions. Before the atoms get close enough for the attractive and repulsive forces to balance out, a sudden discontinuous change in the electron orbits takes place and the electrons cease to revolve solely round their parent nuclei. Nordheim was unable to find an interatomic distance at which the energy of the combined system was less than that of the separated atoms; this led to the conclusion that the use of classical mechanics to discuss the stationary states of the molecular electrons had broken down comprehensively [33], [34]. This negative result was true of all the molecular calculations attempted within the Old Quantum Theory framework which was simply incapable of accounting for covalent bonding [35].",

The time τ 0.9 to reach a steady state strongly depends on ε + 1 , as shown in Figure 2a. We define τ 0.9 as the time when water concentration reaches 90% of its stationary value. It is well approximated by the function τ 0.9 ≈ 0.13 × (ε + 1 ) −0.834 ns.

Since barrier calculations alone will not settle the controversy about the desorption mechanism [91], dynamics calculations are necessary in order to find out how the potential energy at the barrier is distributed over the various degrees of freedom of this system (hydrogen vibration, rotation, and translational energy, and vibrations of the Si substrate). Due to the importance of lattice relaxation effects on the desorption dynamics, substrate degrees of freedom have to be taken into account in the dynamics simulations. This makes a full quantum dynamical treat-ment not possible at the moment. Ab initio molecular dynamics calculations using both the supercell approach [58] and clusters [59] have therefore been performed. In the supercell calculations DFT-GGA was employed to determine the desorption dynamics of deuterium desorbing from the monohydride (MH) state using a (2×2) surface unit cell and a five-layer Si slab [58] (see Fig. 16). In the cluster calculations hydrogen desorption was treated on the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) level.

This agrees with the equivalent observation for L-alanine, but in the case of bDA this feature is more prominent. The inclusion of ZP quantum motion is therefore central in calculating finite temperature shielding anisotropies, and sampling the vibrational phase space using molecular dynamics would fail to reproduce the effects of vibrations on the shielding anisotropy. In line with the observation from the temperature dependence of the isotropic shift, the CH 3 methyl group dominates the temperature dependence of the shielding anisotropy.\n\nThe Monte Carlo calculations reported used 1000 sampling points. The quadratic expansion used 618 data points, taking into account the need to average over positive and negative displacements. For this larger system, the computational gain obtained with the quadratic expansion is not as dramatic as for MgO and L-alanine, but it is nonetheless important. We note that the number of Monte Carlo sampling points required is determined by the desired size of the statistical uncertainty. For the isotropic shift, the use of 1000 data points leads to statistical uncertainties in the range 10-30% of the full ZP correction for hydrogen atoms 2-4 and 8-12, for atom 6 of about 60%, and for atom 1 the statistical uncertainty is too large to be able to distinguish the ZP correction from zero. At finite temperature the uncertainties are expected to be even larger. These uncertainties suggest that the number of data points used here would still be inadequate for some applications.

By comparison, the 2 3 P J states of 4 He are narrow (1.6 MHz vs. 100 MHz) because they cannot decay to the ground 1 1 S 0 state by allowed electric dipole transitions. Since the energy differences between the three 2 3 P levels and the corresponding transition frequencies can be calculated and measured with reasonably small uncertainties, it has long been hoped that the fine structure of 4 He could one day provide a competitive value of α. Although the past 4 years has seen considerable progress toward this goal, it has not yet been reached. In brief, the situation is as follows.",

For X = Br, I, the most relevant stationary points were located, including the rate-limiting transition state and the local minima it connects. The energy required for S 2 loss increases with decreasing halogen electron affinity from chlorine to iodine, while the loss of a halogen atom becomes less endothermic. At the same time, direct dissociation of a halogen atom is entropically favored over the S 2 dissociation pathway shown in Figure 6, which involves a series of tight transition states; dissociation of an iodine atom from [Mo 3 S 7 I 5 ] − with 2.04 eV lies below the barrier for S 2 dissociation at 2.12 eV. While this small difference lies within the computational uncertainties, both entropy and calculated energetics are in line with the experimental observation of exclusive iodine loss.\n\nDiscussion. The experiments also yield further insight into the stability of the Mo 3 core unit. After the loss of S 2 as the second step, the required energy for halogen atom loss remains relatively unchanged (see Figure 5). The pathways listed in Table 1 show that further fragmentation of the X = Cl species involves disintegration of the Mo 3 S 5 core and loss of [Mo m S n Cl p ] species, consistent with the high binding energy of chlorine. In contrast, the much weaker bound iodine atoms are readily lost as I or I 2 units, while S 2 elimination is observed in overall low abundance and most likely only after additional iodine loss. The strength of the Mo−X bond decreases from Mo−Cl through Mo−Br to Mo−I, and consistently, loss of [Mo m S n Br p ] as well as Br, Br 2 , and even SBr is observed.",

For example, when it was introduced in 1994 [19], the many-electron problem which was solved was that of the time-dependent multi-photon ionisation of a strongly correlated, multi-configurational ground state, with a multi-channel continuum. Specifically, we chose a negative ion, Li − , and the initial state was labelled by an MCHF wavefunction, 0.93 (1s 2 2s 2 ) + 0.36(1s 2 2p 2 ) 1 S. The final channels were defined by the 1s 2 2s 2 S and 1s 2 2p 2 P o states of Li. The solution of the METDSE for states of negative ions with near-degeneracies constitutes a good test for the quality of any formalism and methodology.\n\nThe central argument of the SSEA is to invoke the fundamental equation of Quantum Mechanics concerning the expansion of (t ) over the stationary states of the Hamiltonian. Hence, by taking into account the characteristics of each problem, the foundational starting point is the construction of expansions such as those of Equations (1) and (2). This means that the N-electron stationary wavefunctions representing discrete, scattering and resonance states must be as stateand property-specific as possible [2,10]. For example, this is done straightforwardly, conceptually and practically, for the hydrogen atom where the state-specific eigenfunctions of the discrete and the continuous spectrum are known exactly. (Of course, no resonance states are present in the hydrogen spectrum.) However, when it comes to many-electron arbitrary electronic structures and complex spectra, one is obviously faced with multifaceted problems and serious challenges. Some of them have already been treated. Obviously, many remain, especially as regards the (approximately) state-specific calculation and use of excited wavefunctions in polyatomic molecules.",

We show that some of these results appear questionable and in a few cases even clearly unreliable, a fact which may also affect the prediction of collision cross sections based on such data. Our analysis uses Quantum Defect Theory scaling laws and is supported by variational R-matrix calculations. Some simple recipes are discussed, which may help users of ab initio quantum chemistry packages to assess the quality of their results.\n\nUncertainty estimates in theoretical calculations and modeling are becoming an important issue in present-day Atomic and Molecular Physics, both in spectroscopic and collisional applications [1]. Until recently, numerical theoretical data were typically published either in graphical form or as extensive data tables, usually without much indication as to their expected uncertainty. New theoretical data were compared to theoretical or experimental results available in the literature, and the agreement between the new results and existing data was then taken as an indicator of the accuracy of the results obtained.\n\nTo some extent the comparison of new data with previous ones may indeed serve as a rough measure of the uncertainty. However, when new calculations are presented for which no previous results exist to compare with, it is desirable to provide estimated uncertainties or error bars along with the data. Such estimates are important when experimental work based on high quality theoretical predictions is carried out, and they may become crucial, for instance when theoretical and experimental data are combined in metrology.\n\nThe present contribution deals with first principles calculations of highly excited molec-ular electronic states in instances where spectroscopic level accuracy is needed to interpret levels and transitions observed in high-resolution spectroscopy. Specifically we present a critical review of selected published quantum-chemical calculations of Rydberg and doubly-excited Born-Oppenheimer electronic states of diatomic hydrogen H 2 and the helium hydride ion HeH + , which serve here as benchmark systems for homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules in general.",

In the case of adsorption under the interface, a decrease in the density of surface states is also observed, and the binding energy of the adatom with the supercluster is higher than in the previous case (Figure 6b). For adsorption under the interface, the effect of the Au atoms' mobility on the value of the binding energy with the D atom was also investigated. As shown by calculations, if we allow the two nearest Au atoms to move, the binding energy will increase by 0.46 eV (+2Au*), and if we remove the \"freezing\" from degrees of freedom for all Au atoms, the binding energy will increase by only 0.05 eV (+13Au*). Thus, it is possible to describe the interaction of D with a supercluster as local, since the perturbation of the atomic and electronic structure occurs on the atoms closest to D. In Figure 6c, one can see that the adsorption of the D atom at the top of the Au 13 cluster does not lead to any noticeable decrease in the density of surface states. The binding energy of the D atom with the supercluster is calculated for three similar cases. Note that the difference in the adsorption energy at the interface and at the top is small (i.e., the surface migration of D adatoms is constrained because of a significant activation barrier). Existence of this barrier was confirmed experimentally in our previous work [20], where we described strong bonding between hydrogen and gold nanoparticles on the surface of graphite and the long transition time (up to 25-30 h) of the system to the final (stationary) state. Of course, the real values of binding energy are likely to be significantly lower than the calculated ones, which is at least partly due to the absence of the correction of basis set superposition error, but such comparison of calculated values is valid.

By taking the ratio of base-10 exponents of the values displayed for a given transition state and the relevant minimum, and multiplying by the speed of light and reaction path degeneracy as shown in Equation 1, the reaction rate can be calculated. As such, the integrated state-density for the final hydrogen-loss transition state is about three orders of magnitude less than for the limiting transition state for the ethylene-loss pathway, despite the similar energies of these transition states.

The first estimation of the deceleration rates was done in [12], semiclassical calculations were done in [13,14], and quantum mechanical calculations in [9,11,15].\n\n\nCoulomb De-excitation\n\nThe Coulomb de-excitation (Table 1), where the transition energy is shared between the colliding particles, is an important acceleration mechanism producing 'hot' (E ≫ 1 eV) exotic atoms (see Fig. 4a). The highly-energetic π − p atoms were discovered experimentally in [52], and a multicomponent structure of the energy distribution was found in [46]. Recent experiments in liquid and gaseous hydrogen [47,48] found the shape of the kinetic energy distribution to be consistent with the Coulomb mechanism. The cascade calculations [29] show that the π − p atoms with kinetic energy E ≥ 50 eV are not significantly decelerated between the Coulomb de-excitation and the nuclear reaction. For the atoms with E ≤ 20 eV the deceleration is important and the Coulomb peaks are expected to be smeared out.\n\nThe earlier calculations of the Coulomb transitions [16][17][18][19] were rather controversial. The latest calculations [20][21][22] seem to clarify the theoretical picture. This removes one of the uncertainties in the cascade calculation of the past where a Coulomb rate-tuning parameter was used to normalize the calculated high-energy component to the measurements in pionic hydrogen [29]. It is not excluded that the Coulomb de-excitation can be part of a multistep process. For instance, the formation of excited molecular states can be followed by a Coulomb-like decay [2,54,55].\n\n\nAtomic Cascade in H-D Mixtures",

For iron ions at r = 0.0 μm (Fig. 9), the measured distribution ranges from~2 to~200 keV μm −1 , whereas the calculated distribution ranges from~30 to~200 keV μm −1 .

Also, in step 3 → 4, a water molecule migrated into the active site. These processes involve very small energy fluctuations because all the changes that occurred were limited to the hydrogen bonding framework. To verify that no significant barriers were present, these reactions were simulated by applying a small potential that mimicked a pull in the reaction direction. As expected, all barriers encountered were very small and were identified as being associated with specific weak noncovalent interactions.\n\n\nProperties of transition states",

As already observed in the case of MgO, the two approaches are in agreement within the statistical uncertainty of the Monte Carlo sampling results for all atomic species and all atoms. We note that the uncertainty associated with the ZP correction of individual atoms in the Monte Carlo evaluation is highly correlated because for every structure sampled we calculate the chemical shielding tensor on all atoms in the crystal.

For all species and atoms, the ZP correction is quite large, and represents about 50% of the overall vibrational correction even at a temperature of T = 500 K.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we show the ZP correction to the shielding anisotropy of L-alanine, evaluated by Monte Carlo sampling (light red bands) and using the quadratic expansion (red triangles). For carbon atom 3 and oxygen atom 1, the ordering of the principal values of the chemical shielding tensor reverses between the static and vibrationallyaveraged calculations, and this is indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 5. In these cases, the ZP correction shown corresponds to ∆σ SA = | σ SA | − |σ SA |.",

For all investigated cases, ‫ܬ‬ ଵ remains largely ferromagnetic although in some cases it experiences a noticeable decrease. On the other hand, ‫ܬ‬ ଶ does switch from ferro-to antiferro-character depending on the conformation. Nevertheless, ‫ܬ‬ ଵ is, in all cases, one order of magnitude larger than ‫ܬ‬ ଶ , thus remaining the dominant magnetic interaction. To conclude the study, a similar analysis was carried out on more realistic molecules where the steric protection of the radical centres is increased by i) substituting the hydrogen atom in each carbon-based radical by a phenyl ring for ܰ = 4, 5, 7, 8 or ii) substituting all hydrogen atoms by chlorine atoms for ܰ = 4 (see Table SI 9 in the SI). The general trends are the same but the absolute values of the magnetic coupling constants are smaller, due mainly to a larger delocalization of the unpaired spin density on the rings that do not participate in the exchange coupling. For instance, ‫ܬ‬ ଵ drops from 2333 to 1637 cm -1 for the lowest stationary point found for ܰ = 8 after replacing the hydrogen atoms in the radical centre by phenyl groups.\n\nAdditionally, the fully chlorinated ܰ = 4 case also shows a ferromagnetic ground state in both stationary points found, despite presenting a smaller ‫ܬ‬ ଵ value. Finally, the relative energy position of the molecular orbitals does not depend on the size of the molecule and the steric protection of the radical centres does not significantly modify the HOMO-LUMO gap, which remains around 2 eV (see Figures SI2 and SI3 in the SI). This is in contrast with what is predicted for planar arrangements of triarylmethyl-based polyradicals. 74 Nevertheless, the important finding is that, irrespective of the HDVV used to map the different magnetic solution, removing edges significantly stabilizes the FM ground state, strongly suggesting that this may be a potential way to obtain polyradicals with robust ferromagnetism.",

We show that some of these results appear questionable and in a few cases even clearly unreliable, a fact which may also affect the prediction of collision cross sections based on such data. Our analysis uses Quantum Defect Theory scaling laws and is supported by variational R-matrix calculations. Some simple recipes are discussed, which may help users of ab initio quantum chemistry packages to assess the quality of their results.Uncertainty estimates in theoretical calculations and modeling are becoming an important issue in present-day Atomic and Molecular Physics, both in spectroscopic and collisional applications [1]. Until recently, numerical theoretical data were typically published either in graphical form or as extensive data tables, usually without much indication as to their expected uncertainty. New theoretical data were compared to theoretical or experimental results available in the literature, and the agreement between the new results and existing data was then taken as an indicator of the accuracy of the results obtained.To some extent the comparison of new data with previous ones may indeed serve as a rough measure of the uncertainty. However, when new calculations are presented for which no previous results exist to compare with, it is desirable to provide estimated uncertainties or error bars along with the data. Such estimates are important when experimental work based on high quality theoretical predictions is carried out, and they may become crucial, for instance when theoretical and experimental data are combined in metrology.The present contribution deals with first principles calculations of highly excited molec-ular electronic states in instances where spectroscopic level accuracy is needed to interpret levels and transitions observed in high-resolution spectroscopy. Specifically we present a critical review of selected published quantum-chemical calculations of Rydberg and doubly-excited Born-Oppenheimer electronic states of diatomic hydrogen H 2 and the helium hydride ion HeH + , which serve here as benchmark systems for homonuclear and heteronuclear diatomic molecules in general.On the basis of Rydberg scaling laws we are able to show that certain published calculations are not converged and doubtless deviate substantially from the exact values. We further demonstrate that the alternative approach that we have been developing for a number of years now, based on variational R-matrix theory[3], may help to avoid these drawbacks and is able to provide a comprehensive insight into the structure and dynamics of highly-excited states.References[1] Chung H-K et al 2016",

Recent work has shown that primordial gas that is not collapsing gravitationally but is cooling from an initially ionized state forms hydrogen deuteride, HD, in sufficient amounts to cool the gas to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background. This extra cooling can reduce the characteristic mass for gravitational fragmentation and may cause a shift in the characteristic masses of population III stars. Motivated by the importance of the atomic and molecular data for the cosmological question, we assess several chemical and radiative processes that have hitherto been neglected: the sensitivity of the low temperature H 2 cooling rate to the ratio of ortho-H 2 to para-H 2 , the uncertainty in the low temperature cooling rate of H 2 excited by collisions with atomic hydrogen, the effects of cooling from H 2 excited by collisions with protons and electrons, and the large uncertainties in the rates of several of the reactions responsible for determining the H 2 fraction in the gas.It is shown that the most important of neglected processes is the excitation of H 2 by collisions with protons and electrons. This cools the gas more rapidly at early times, and so it forms less H 2 and HD at late times. This fact, as well as several of the chemical uncertainties presented here, significantly affects the thermal evolution of the gas. We anticipate that this may lead to clear differences in future detailed three dimensional studies of first structure formation. In such calculations it has previously been shown that the details of the timing between cooling and merger events decides between immediate runaway gravitational collapse and a slower collapse delayed by turbulent heating.Finally, we show that although the thermal evolution of the gas is in principle sensitive to the ortho-para ratio, in practice the standard assumption of a 3:1 ratio produces results that are almost indistinguishable from those produced by a more detailed treatment.Johnson & Bromm 2006;Johnson, Greif & Bromm 2007;Yoshida et al. 2007). Note, however, that even without HD cooling the characteristic masses of objects collapsing from gas within a relic primordial H ii region have already been demonstrated to be smaller(O'Shea et al. 2005).This difference in thermal evolution, depending on whether or not the gas was once ionized, is a consequence of the chemistry of HD formation and destruction.

The VASP optimized structure is then used to derive all the results reported here using the NRLMOL code [24][25][26][27]. The NRLMOL code has previously been used to study large light-harvesting systems [28][29][30]. In this work, we have used both the all-electron formalism and pesudopotential formalism wherever all-electron approach was difficult to apply due to the large size of the molecule. we used a mixed all-electron and pseudopotential approach for the ground state calculations. In the ground state calculation, all-electron basis is used for the hydrogens and the zinc atoms whereas for all the other types of atoms pseudopotential given by Bachelet, Hammam and Schluter is used [31].",

Therefore, our results indicated that the two forms actually had slightly different bond lengths at the Fe 4 S 4 cluster. The Fe 4 S 4 cluster consists of two Fe 2 S 2 subclusters, Fe1-S4-Fe2-S3 and Fe3-S1-Fe4-S2 [32]. The intra-subcluster bond lengths are decreased by the oxidation, while inter-subcluster bond lengths are not (Fig 5A). The largest changes are observed in the Fe−S bonds around Fe1 and Fe2. In addition, the bond lengths of Fe-(Cys-S γ ) for all Fe atoms are also decreased by the oxidation. The almost identical redox-related structural changes are",
