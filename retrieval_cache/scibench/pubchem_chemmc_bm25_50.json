Upon administration, teverelix directly competes with GnRH for receptor binding in the anterior pituitary gland, thereby inhibiting GnRH receptor signaling. This inhibits the secretion and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In males, the inhibition of LH secretion prevents the release of testosterone. Since testosterone is required to sustain prostate growth, reducing testosterone levels may inhibit hormone-dependent prostate cancer cell proliferation. In females, this prevents the production of estrogen by the ovaries and may relieve symptoms from sex-hormone dependent diseases.']",

Nitrogen oxides are released to the air from the exhaust of motor vehicles, the burning of coal, oil, or natural gas, and during processes such as arc welding, electroplating, engraving, and dynamite blasting. They are also produced commercially by reacting nitric acid with metals or cellulose. Nitrogen oxides are used in the production of nitric acid, lacquers, dyes, and other chemicals.
