A five-step procedure was developed: (i) Low-angle background, consisting of a portion of the incident x-ray beam that passes directly to the detector, is measured using a specially designed replacement for the sample holder which absorbs most of the photons that otherwise would scatter off the sample holder cavity. (ii) Angle-dependent effects including monochromator efficiency and projected beam area are characterized by extracting the incoherent signal from the diffraction pattern of powdered graphite. The incoherent signal divided by the calculated incoherent cross section gives a correction factor as a function of scattering angle theta. (iii) Diffraction patterns are measured for the samples for theta = 2 degrees -150 degrees. (iv) The scattering data are corrected for background and then for angle-dependent effects. (v) The data are normalized to calculated free atom form factors at high theta, and the coherent form factor extracted. The method was implemented on two diffractometers at different energies (Co Kalpha and Cu Kalpha), and the results compared for water and plastics. Over the range 0.117 &lt; x &lt; 5.39 nm(-1), where x = lambda(-1) sin(theta/2), the average form factor ratio for water was 0.93. Systematic errors are difficult to eliminate. While this x-ray powder diffractometer technique suffices for a survey measurement of the form factor of a material, its accuracy is probably insufficient for detailed studies.",

At grazing angles, the positions are calculated using the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), whereas for larger angles where the diffracted beams are transmitted though the substrate, the Born approximation (BA) is used. This method has been incorporated into simulation code (called NANOCELL) and may be used to overlay simulated spot patterns directly onto two-dimensional (2D) grazing angle of incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) patterns and 2D SAXS patterns. The GISAXS simulations are limited to the case where the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle (alpha(i) &gt; alpha(c)) and the diffraction occurs above the critical angle (alpha(f) &gt; alpha(c)). For cases of surfactant self-assembled films, the limitations are not restrictive because, typically, the critical angle is around 0.2 degrees but the largest d spacings occur around 0.8 degrees 2theta. For these materials, one finds that the DWBA predicts that the spot positions from the transmitted main beam deviate only slightly from the BA and only for diffraction peaks close the critical angle. Additional diffraction peaks from the reflected main beam are observed in GISAXS geometry but are much less intense. Using these simulations, 2D spot patterns may be used to identify space group, identify the orientation, and quantitatively fit the lattice constants for SAXS data from any angle of incidence. Characteristic patterns for 2D GISAXS and 2D low-angle transmission SAXS patterns are generated for the most common thin film structures, and as a result, GISAXS and SAXS patterns that were previously difficult to interpret are now relatively straightforward. The simulation code (NANOCELL) is written in Mathematica and is available from the author upon request.",

Numerical solutions were obtained for all theta(B) (0-90 degrees ) and samples with tau(0) from 0 to 30, and xi(0) from 0 to 25. The relationship between the power ratio distribution curves, the integrated reflection power ratio and the diffraction geometry of cylindrical crystals is obtained for the first time and analyzed in detail.

To build up the coupled solutions of these basic equations beyond the perturbation theory constraint 2k\u03c3\u03b80 &lt; 1, a simple iteration procedure is proposed as opposed to the self-consistent wave approach [Chukhovskii (2011). Acta Cryst. A67, 200-209; Chukhovski (2012). Acta Cryst. A68, 505-512]. Using the first-order iteration, analytical expressions for the averaged specular and non-specular scattering intensity distributions have been obtained. These expressions are further analysed in terms of the GISAXS parameters {k, \u03b8, \u03b80} and surface finish ones {\u03c3, l, h}, where \u03b8 and \u03b80 are the scattering and incidence angles of the X-rays, respectively, \u03c3 is the root-mean-square roughness, l is the correlation length, h is the fractal surface model index, k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, and \u03bb is the X-ray wavelength. A direct way to determine the surface finish parameters from the experimental specular and diffuse scattering indicatrix scan data is discussed for an example of GISAXS measurements from rough surfaces of \u03b1-quartz and CdTe samples.",

The equations given here can be used in many optical applications. For example, ellipsometric data measured at an incidence angle theta(p) will have higher precision than data measured at other incidence angles. theta(p) is the principal angle. Instead of three principal angles, there is only one principal angle, which can be found in the region of 0 &lt; or = theta(p) &lt; or = 90 degrees for most metallic materials used in applications. Results show good agreement between the measured and the calculated spectra of delta(p) and rho(po).",

The IMPF values (\u03bb) were obtained from the NIST database [21]. For the present application to Cu, Ag and Au the available option \"recommended IMPF values\" was preferred. The TRMFP was computed using Eq.[A9] below and the numerical values of the elastic scattering cross section \u03c3 tr available from the NIST database [22] :\n[A9] ! tr X = 1 N V X \" tr X\nThese last three parameters are varying with the kinetic energy of the photoelectron, and for each emission line they were evaluated at the measured peak energy. Finally, the numerical values of the atomic asymmetry parameter and of the total photoelectric cross-section were read from the tables of Yeh and Lindau [23] and Scofield [24] respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, the TD(E K ) can be expressed in the frame of the first principles method, by the following equation\n[A10] TD(E K X ) = I(E K X ) K !

The angle between U and V is \u03c0-\u03b2 with \u03b2 equal to 58\u00b0 in our experimental setting-up. The cosine of angle \u03c8 between U and W is equal to the dot product U\u2022W. The cartesian coordinate system Ox,Oy,Oz is so defined as to have V colinear with Oz, and U in plane xOz. Using spherical coordinates r,\u03b8,\u03c6 one may write : U = i sin\u03b2 -k cos\u03b2 and W = i sin\u03b1 cos\u03b8 + j sin\u03b1 sin\u03b8 + k cos\u03b1.

Special angles at which quarter-wave phase shifts are achieved are determined as functions of the relative refractive index N. When the average phase shift equals pi/2, the differential reflection phase shift delta is maximum, and the reflection Jones matrix assumes a simple form. For N &gt; square root 3, the average and differential phase shifts are equal (hence deltap = 3 deltas) at a certain angle phi that is determined as a function of N. All phase shifts rise with infinite slope at the critical angle. The limiting slope of the delta-versus-phi curve at grazing incidence (partial partial differential delta/partial partial differential phi)phi=90 degrees = -(2/N)(N2 - 1)1/2 = -2 cos phic, where phic is the critical angle and (partial partial differential2 delta/partial partial differential phi 2)phi=90 degrees = 0. Therefore delta is proportional to the grazing incidence angle theta = 90 degrees - phi (for small theta) with a slope that depends on N. The largest separation between the angle of maximum delta and the critical angle is 9.88 degrees and occurs when N = 1.55377. Finally, several techniques are presented for determining the relative refractive index N by using TIR ellipsometry.",

The width is the same as that given by Scherrer (1918) and can be modified for different shapes by using the average number of planes N hkl , e.g. Wilson (1963), Fewster (2015. The direction of this broadening was discussed earlier, which gives the full fringe pattern around the Bragg condition peak. The impact of not including all these fringes is not a problem provided the same dynamic range is assumed during the data collection; this is covered in x7. So as not to deviate too far from traditional methods, the structure factor is assumed to represent the full scattering for each reflection, i.e. F hkl . The integral of I 2X should therefore equate to |F hkl | 2 .",

The middle row of Fig. 4 shows results for ion beams with different intensities incident from the same polar angle ( (2) and (3) in Table I) and the lower row shows corresponding results for ion beams of identical intensities, but incident from different polar angles and with different beam parameters ( (1) and (4) in Table I). White arrows in Fig. 4 indicate the projection of the ion beams into the x \u2212 y plane (thus they enclose \u2206\u03c6), and we have chosen the geometry such that the x-axis always is the bisector of this angle. For balanced beams and 0 \u2264 \u2206\u03c6 < 90 \u2022 , we observe ripples with a wave vector parallel to the x-axis, for 90 \u2022 < \u2206\u03c6 < 180 \u2022 , the ripple wave vector is parallel to the y-axis, but the ripple pattern shows more defects. Exactly at \u2206\u03c6 = 90 \u2022 , square patterns replace the ripples. For unbalanced beams, we observe ripples in oblique directions, which we will discuss below. The erosion rates parallel and perpendicular to the beam projection onto the x \u2212 y plane, \u03bd and \u03bd \u22a5 , are given in Table I. The middle and lower row of Fig. 4 are given to emphasize that we did not observe any differences in pattern formation due to different mechanisms of imbalance. All mechanisms we tried lead to the same patterns, if they imply the same erosion rates of linear theory, up to a common constant factor.\n\nNote, however, that in all our simulations both rates \u03bd and \u03bd \u22a5 are negative -unlike the situation in Ref. 13 -indicating that the crossed beams do not mutually suppress their generated ripples. Thus we have nothing to say here about the puzzling results of Ref. 13, who find structures in DIBS setups, for which a straightforward application of continuum theory would predict smooth surfaces.",

In range I, an iso-Phi(p)B contour resembles a cardioid. In range II, the contour gradually transforms toward a circle centered on the origin as Phi(p)B increases. However, the deviation from a circle is still substantial. Only near grazing incidence (Phi(p)B &gt; 80 degrees ) is the iso-Phi(p)B contour accurately approximated as a circle. We find that |?| &lt; 1 for Phi(p)B &lt; 37.23 degrees , and |?| &gt; 1 for Phi(p)B &gt; 45 degrees .

Valid multiple solutions (n,k) for a given measurement set (R(0),phi(p)B) are possible in the domain of fractional optical constants. An analytical solution of the (R(0),Phi(p)B) ?

X-Ray Crystallography - \nThe size of the unit cell and the arrangement of atoms in a crystal may be determined from measurements of the diffraction of X-rays by the crystal, termed X-ray crystallography. Diffraction is the change in the direction of travel experienced by an electromagnetic wave when it encounters a physical barrier whose dimensions are comparable to those of the wavelength of the light. X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths about as long as the distance between neighboring atoms in crystals (on the order of a few $\\AA$ ).\n\nWhen a beam of monochromatic X-rays strikes a crystal, its rays are scattered in all directions by the atoms within the crystal. When scattered waves traveling in the same direction encounter one another, they undergo interference, a process by which the waves combine to yield either an increase or a decrease in amplitude (intensity) depending upon the extent to which the combining waves' maxima are separated (see Figure 10.63).\n\n\nConstructive interface\n(a)\n\n\nDestructive interface\n(b)\n\nFIGURE 10.63 Light waves occupying the same space experience interference, combining to yield waves of greater (a) or lesser (b) intensity, depending upon the separation of their maxima and minima.\n\nWhen X-rays of a certain wavelength, $\\lambda$, are scattered by atoms in adjacent crystal planes separated by a distance, $d$, they may undergo constructive interference when the difference between the distances traveled by the two waves prior to their combination is an integer factor, $n$, of the wavelength. This condition is satisfied when the angle of the diffracted beam, $\\theta$, is related to the wavelength and interatomic distance by the equation:\n\n$$\nn \\lambda=2 d \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nThis relation is known as the Bragg equation in honor of W. H. Bragg, the English physicist who first explained this phenomenon. Figure 10.64 illustrates two examples of diffracted waves from the same two crystal planes. The figure on the left depicts waves diffracted at the Bragg angle, resulting in constructive interference, while that on the right shows diffraction and a different angle that does not satisfy the Bragg condition, resulting in destructive interference.",

As the planes are rotated the intensity associated with the intersection of the truncation rod moves as expected (the specular peak) but the peak at 2 B remains stationary. The explanation given by Fewster (2014Fewster ( , 2016Fewster ( , 2017 is that there is persistent intensity along 2 B for the feature of interest, which can be understood by considering the phase relationships between scattering points along each The distribution of path lengths equal to one wavelength (to within a very small tolerance) from scattering points on adjacent planes. As the tolerance is reduced it concentrates on a single value at 2 B and the other coincidences become sparser.

For example, in Fig. 1(c), the black curve for \u03b8 = 40 0 is lower from the 19th to the 49th order, while the red curve for \u03b8 = 50 0 is lower from the 49th to the 93rd order. The striking intersection of the two curves is at the 49th order. As the laser intensity changes, the intersection of the two curves is almost invariable, as indicated by the vertical solid line. The calculated harmonic spectra at other orientation angles \u03b8 also show the similar phenomena as those revealed in Fig. 1. But the intersections of the harmonic curves change as the orientation angles change. For example, as presented in Fig. 2, the intersection of two harmonic curves at \u03b8 = 30 0 and \u03b8 = 50 0 is at the 39th order (indicated by the vertical solid line). This is different from that in Fig. 1.\n\nNext, we concentrate on the physical mechanism behind these phenomena. In Fig. 3, with the same parameters as in Fig. 1, we plot the harmonic spectra calculated using the Lewenstein model Eq. 2 and the modified transition dipole Eq. 5. One can see that the primary characteristics of the harmonic spectra in Fig. 3 are analogous with those of the corresponding curves in Fig. 1. For instance, in each subpannel of Fig. 3, the intersection of two harmonic spectra in the plateau region is at the 49th order, as indicated by the vertical solid curves. This is in agreement with that in Fig. 1. The parallelism between the corresponding curves in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 shows that the modified model, i.e., Eq. 2 with Eq. 5, is applicable here for the description of the molecular HHG, especially for the angle dependence of the HHG. This applicability is also consolidated below.",

The difference between theta(p) and theta(o) is most significant in the Otto and Kretschmann geometries using metal films with large damping loss, such as Ni or Fe. In addition, we determine the angle theta(m) at which maximum power density is coupled into the metal surface and show that in general the value of theta(m) is also different from both theta(o) and theta(p), the difference being again largest in the Otto or Kretschmann geometries. The differences between theta(o), theta(p), and theta(m) are much smaller, but still detectable, in long-range surface plasmon and extended-range surface plasmon geometries. In all cases, the preferred incidence angle depends on whether one needs to optimize either the plasmon field composition or the power density in the metal.",

The same methodology is used for the inclined planes.\n\nIf we assume that the crystal is not strained and the number of planes in each region is the same, then the calculation is simplified [equation (15) is the same for all regions]. It is clear with this approach that the level of complexity can be extended (including crystal shape as well as distortions, the influence of defects that define the relationship between and d etc.) to the point where the whole pattern is a summation of all the point scatterers, but the latter is impractical to compute even for small crystals.

It has to be noted that the sample had to be corrected for preferred orientation along (100) and the obtained structural results due to mounting method.\n\nThe diffraction patterns are best reported using the interplanar distance d hkl rather than the value of 2h angle. The peak position at 2h angle depends on instrumental characteristic such a wavelength. The value of d hkl is a characteristic material property, which is used for identification of the substance. Therefore, for each investigated sample, the calculations of d hkl values were done. The value of 2h angle for each diffraction line was drawn from the diffraction pattern. Then, the Bragg's Law was used to convert the observed 2h angle position to d hkl .\n\nNext, the calculated interplanar distances d hkl were compared with the d hkl values from the ICDD database.\n\nThe calculated values of d hkl are in a good accordance with those presented in the ICDD database (see Tables 5 and 6).\n\nAccording to [10] if peak shifts within a suspect product XRD spectrum are greater than 0.2\u00b0for a given 2h diffraction angle compared to the authentic XRD spectrum, then the product meets the criteria for a counterfeit product.\n\nBelow, in Fig. 5, we present an exemplary comparison of the calculated and basic values of d hkl for Aspirin Bayer and Vitamin C (Apteo). We obtained similar results for the rest of the tested samples. For all samples, the calculated values of d hkl , and those from the ICDD database are in a good agreement, confirming that the investigated samples contain a correct amount of active substance.\n\nThe intensities of the diffraction lines depend on the content of the component in the tested preparation. This dependence is not linear, because at the same amount of substance in different mixtures, the intensities of its diffraction lines vary depending on the X-ray absorption coefficient in the mixture. Therefore, different intensity lines for the active substance were observed in the obtained diffraction patterns.",

At pi &lt; pi(s) there is a molecular tilt of 16 degrees +/- 7 degrees . Independent x-ray reflectivity data yield a tilt of 26 degrees +/- 7 degrees . Concomitant with the tilt, the diffraction data indicate a transition from a hexagonal to a distorted-hexagonal lattice.

Our results suggest that compressive hydrostatic pressure lowers the energy barrier for the parent DA reaction while suppressing the undesirable side reaction, thereby leading to a direct increase in the yield of cyclohexene. Compressive pressure also increases the exothermicity of the parent DA reaction, which would lead to increased temperatures in a reaction vessel and thereby indirectly increase the yield of cyclohexene. Our estimates indicate that the compression used in our study corresponds to a range of 68 MPa-1410 MPa. ",

Here, two confined chemicals A = (A 1 , A 2 ) and two open chemicals B = (B 1 , B 2 ) are involved in the two reactions R 1 and R 2 . We can regard the open chemicals B 1 and B 2 as a resource and a waste, respectively, because they are consumed and produced when the reactions forwardly progress. The stoichiometric matrices can be represented as\nS = R 1 R 2 A 1 \u22121 1 A 2 2 \u22121 , O = R 1 R 2 B 1 \u22121 0 B 2 0 1 .(12)\nThe regularity of the matrix S is confirmed by det[S] = \u22121 = 0. Denoting the number of A = (A 1 , A 2 ) by X = (X 1 , X 2 ), the reaction dynamics for the confined chemicals is written as\ndX i dt = S i r J r (t) .(13)\nIn this example, we employ mass action kinetics with the local detailed balance condition [44,45,52,53,61] for the reaction flux J(t) (see Sec. VIII for details).

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Derive reaction quotients from chemical equations representing homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions\n- Calculate values of reaction quotients and equilibrium constants, using concentrations and pressures\n- Relate the magnitude of an equilibrium constant to properties of the chemical system\n\nThe status of a reversible reaction is conveniently assessed by evaluating its reaction quotient ( $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ ). For a reversible reaction described by\n\n$$\nm \\mathrm{~A}+n \\mathrm{~B} \\rightleftharpoons x \\mathrm{C}+y \\mathrm{D}\n$$\n\nthe reaction quotient is derived directly from the stoichiometry of the balanced equation as\n\n$$\nQ_{c}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{C}]^{x}[\\mathrm{D}]^{y}}{[\\mathrm{~A}]^{m}[\\mathrm{~B}]^{n}}\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $c$ denotes the use of molar concentrations in the expression. If the reactants and products are gaseous, a reaction quotient may be similarly derived using partial pressures:\n\n$$\nQ_{p}=\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{C}}^{x} P_{\\mathrm{D}}^{y}}{P_{\\mathrm{A}}^{m} P_{\\mathrm{B}}^{n}}\n$$\n\nNote that the reaction quotient equations above are a simplification of more rigorous expressions that use relative values for concentrations and pressures rather than absolute values. These relative concentration and pressure values are dimensionless (they have no units); consequently, so are the reaction quotients. For purposes of this introductory text, it will suffice to use the simplified equations and to disregard units when computing $Q$. In most cases, this will introduce only modest errors in calculations involving reaction quotients.",

Now in order to determine the temperature and species concentration gradients within the representative cell; the cell is discretized into a number of control volumes which will be discussed below.\n\n\nConservation of Mass\n\nThe two main sets of equations, conservation of mass and conservation of energy, are solved simultaneously in each of the nodes. It will be seen that the number of unknowns matches the number of equations so a unique solution is obtained. The conservation of mass is solved by the following equations for total number of moles:\nout in N R N dt dN & & \u2212 + = \u2211 (8) \u239f \u239f \u23a0 \u239e \u239c \u239c \u239d \u239b \u2212 + = \u2211 out u in out T R PV dt d R N N & & (9)\nNote that the amount of moles in the node is known through the ideal gas law. Also, in this discretized setup it is assumed that the mole fractions and temperature of the node are the same as those at the node exit. Of course, it would have been equally valid to use the mole fractions and temperature at the node inlet instead. Each of these assumptions produces an error, which can only be resolved by selection of an infinitesimally small node.\n\nThe conservation equations for the individual species can be found by expressing the moles of a species as the product of the total number of moles with the mole fraction of that species.",

In the present paper we employ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the bulk and surface molecular structure of ethanol-water mixtures from 0.2 to 95 mol %. The observed XPS binding energy splitting between the methyl C 1s and hydroxymethyl C 1s groups (BES_[CH<sub3</sub-CH<sub2</subOH]) as a function of the ethanol molar percentage can be divided into different regions: one below 35 mol % with higher values (about 1.53 eV) and one starting at 60 mol % up to 95 mol % with 1.49 eV as an average value. The chemical shifts agree with previous quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations [ L\u00f6ytynoja , T. ; J. Phys. Chem. B 2014 , 118 , 13217 ]. According to these calculations, the BES_[CH<sub3</sub-CH<sub2</subOH] is related to the number of hydrogen bonds between the ethanol and the surrounding molecules. As the ethanol concentration increases, the average number of hydrogen bonds decreases from 2.5 for water-rich mixtures to 2 for pure ethanol. We give an interpretation for this behavior based on how the hydrogen bonds are distributed according to the mixing ratio. Since our experimental data are surface sensitive, we propose that this effect may also be manifested at the interface. From the ratio between the XPS C 1s core lines intensities we infer that below 20 mol % the ethanol molecules have their hydroxyl groups more hydrated and possibly facing the solution's bulk. Between 0.1 and 14 mol %, we show the formation of an ethanol monolayer at approximately 2 mol %. Several parameters are derived for the surface region at monolayer coverage.",

At the initial stage of supercritical drying, mole fraction of the solvent inside the pores is accepted as 1 since there is only solvent in the pores. Then, CO2 diffuses into pores whereas the solvent diffuses in the reverse direction, resulting in an increase of the mole fraction of CO2 in the solvent. Consequently, density of the solvent-CO2 mixture in the pores varies during drying. Figures 12 and 13 show how density varies with composition for ethanol-CO2 and acetone-CO2 systems for temperatures and pressures commonly employed in supercritical drying. Maximum percent density changes of the systems between the start of the drying until the point where mole fraction of CO2 is 0.95 can be calculated from the plots as 9% and 4% for ethanol and acetone mixtures, respectively from the data given in Figures 12 and 13. Since the percent density change is small, the main parameter determining the relative volume expansion would be the mole fraction of CO2.

The excess of water favors these desired reactions, which was confirmed by the increase in the selectivity of ethanol-to-CO 2 conversion ( Figure 4) and the increase in the hydrogen yield ( Figure 3). Additionally, a large amount of steam in the substrates inhibited the ethanol dehydration reaction (eq 8) and reduced the selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethylene, acetylene, and coke ( Figure 4). The excess of water did not affect the selectivity of ethanol-to-methane conversion (eq 11) because, in this reaction, water is absent. A reduction of  ethanol-to-methane conversion selectivity (eq 11) at a low water/ethanol molar ratio resulted from the acceleration of the dehydration reaction (eq 8). Increasing the importance of ethanol dehydration (eq 8) increased the selectivity of ethanol conversion to ethylene, acetylene, and coke. This is an expected effect since an increase in ethylene concentration promotes the formation of acetylene (eq 9), and, consequently, an increase in acetylene concentration promotes the formation of coke (eq 10). The selectivity of ethanol conversion to these three products (C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 2 , and coke) reached a total value of \u223c30%. A high coke production (360 mg/h) is particularly disadvantageous since a filter should be frequently replaced.

Nishikawa et al. [1] suggested that concentration fluctuations reach their maximum at ~40 mol % ethanol, based on small angle X-ray scattering experiments. Ben-Naim [6] found that at ~47 mol % ethanol concentration the average affinity between water molecules reaches its maximum, while between ethanol and water molecules, reaches its minimum. All of these findings can be connected to the fact that, according to our simulation data, the percolation threshold for water can be found somewhere between 40 and 60 mol % ethanol concentration in ethanol-water mixtures.\n\nFurthermore, Oleinikova et al.

In this study, a comparison of two gasohol releases (E10 (10:90 ethanol and gasoline, v/v) and E25 (25:75 ethanol and gasoline, v/v) under monitored natural attenuation (MNA) and nitrate biostimulation, respectively) was conducted to assess the most effective remediation strategy for each gasohol release. Microbial communities were assessed to support geochemical data as well as to enable the characterization of important population shifts that evolve during biodegradation processes in E25 and E10 field experiments. Results revealed that natural attenuation processes sufficiently supported ethanol and BTEX compounds biodegradation in E10 release, due to the lower biochemical oxygen demand they exert relative to E25 blend. In E25 release, nitrate reduction was largely responsible for BTEX and ethanol biodegradation, as intended. First-order decay constants demonstrated that ethanol degradation rates were similar (p\u202f&lt;\u202f0.05) for both remediation technologies (2.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.15 and 2.22\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23, for E25 and E10, respectively) whilst BTEX compounds exhibited different degradation rates (p\u202f&gt;\u202f0.05) that were higher for the experiment under MNA (0.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.06 and 0.43\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03, for E25 and E10, respectively). Therefore, ethanol content in different gasohol blends can influence the decision-making on the most suitable remediation technology, as MNA processes can be applied for the remediation of gasohol blends with lower ethanol content (i.e., 10% v/v), once the aquifer geochemical conditions provide a sufficient electron acceptor pool. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first field study to monitor two long-term gasohol releases over various time scales in order to assess feasible remediation technologies for each scenario.",

At the initial stage of supercritical drying, mole fraction of the solvent inside the pores is accepted as 1 since there is only solvent in the pores. Then, CO 2 diffuses into pores whereas the solvent diffuses in the reverse direction, resulting in an increase of the mole fraction of CO 2 in the solvent. Consequently, density of the solvent-CO 2 mixture in the pores varies during drying. Figures 12 and 13 show how density varies with composition for ethanol-CO 2 and acetone-CO 2 systems for temperatures and pressures commonly employed in supercritical drying. Maximum percent density changes of the systems between the start of the drying until the point where mole fraction of CO 2 is 0.95 can be calculated from the plots as 9% and 4% for ethanol and acetone mixtures, respectively from the data given in Figures 12 and 13. Since the percent density change is small, the main parameter determining the relative volume expansion would be the mole fraction of CO 2 . Therefore, the amount of volume expansion would most likely be determined by the mole fraction of CO 2 in the pores which depends on how fast CO 2 diffuses into the pores. Since volume of the pores can be considered as constant during drying, volume expansion would eventually lead to spillage of the pore filling liquid to CO 2 stream. During volume expansion and consequent pressure increase of liquid in the pores, resistances due to surface tension and friction by pore walls are overcome so that there would be a flow and spillage of the expanded liquid. Therefore, both operating conditions and textural properties of gel would affect this transport mechanism.",

In fact, the same ionic conductivity measured in neat methanol is also recorded in the 75:25 and 50:50 methanol-water mixtures (i.e., 0.2 S\u00b7cm \u22121 ). However, when the amount of water exceeds the amount of methanol, an abrupt change of the conductivity properties is recorded. Although the ionic Ohmic behavior is preserved, the 25:75 methanol-water mixture exhibits a far larger conductivity with respect to the remainder samples with different molar ratios, as shown in Figure 4. In particular, a proton conductivity \u03c3 p (X075) = 0.4 S\u00b7cm \u22121 is recorded. This sudden increase of the conductivity is likely due to a structural change of the H-bond network, the latter representing the locus where correlated proton transfers take place. There exist experimental evidences that, at this specific concentration (i.e., 25:75), segregation of the water and methanol phases occurs [6], in that a bi-perculating H-bond network is established for such a molar ratio both in methanol-water mixtures [6] and in ethanol-water mixtures [7]. Hence, because of the more percolated H-bond network in water, exhibiting two donor and two acceptor sites of protons per molecule, a twice ionic conductivity is established with respect to the neat methanol case and the 75:25 and 50:50 methanol-water mixtures. The same rationale, corroborated by the fact that water molecules hold a larger number of protons a priori available for conduction, is capable to account for the noticeably larger proton conductivity measured in neat water. From the respective current-voltage diagram shown in Figure 4 (magenta diamonds), an ionic conductivity \u03c3 p (water) = 1.3 S\u00b7cm \u22121 is inferred. This value is about six times lower than that determined by means of pioneering Car-Parrinello MD simulations [29]. This implies, once again, that a richer statistics and dispersion-corrected GGA functionals are crucially important in describing water and the behavior of its ions [66][67][68]. In summary, under the action of intense static electric fields, the protonic subsystem of water is so far more conductive than that of",

All gelation experiments were performed at a neutral pH (approximately 7.2), allowing an overall mild environment. This comes at the cost of mechanical stability and binding capacity compared to the other methods, putting more chemical or thermal stress on the protein solutions [6]. Figure 1 illustrates the property (ethanol mole fraction versus BSA mole fraction) space of samples prepared at 37 \u2022 C after an incubation time of 16 h. The mole fractions were used to remove the effect of volume dilution that would have to be taken into account for the concentrations. As mentioned above, there also seems to be a minimum amount of BSA needed for the gelation. Below this concentration (1.07 mM), the proteins cannot form enough cross-links to build a gel, potentially because of low probabilities for intermolecular secondary structure (\u03b2-sheet) formation. The absolute values (without ethanol) for gel formation have been extensively studied in a previous publication [6] to find the absolute minimum with ethanol; more experiments are needed and are beyond the scope of this study. Another interesting phenomenon can be observed by the addition of high amounts of ethanol. At molar fractions between 0.3 and 0.35 of ethanol, the obtained gels show a high turbidity. After adding more ethanol, only a turbid liquid is obtained. Nevertheless, above a molar fraction of 0.49, turbid gels can be observed again. The turbidity reflects the inhomogeneity of the gel structure.\n\n\nGeneral Gelation Properties",

The samples obtained had a rod morphology. When the ratios of water to ethanol increased to 20 mL:60 mL and 20 mL:80 mL, relatively large polyhedral granules sized about 300 and 500 nm were obtained. The XRD analysis shown in Figure 1 shows the phase-pure synthesis of the MOF-801 crystals [4,14]. Subsequently, the ratio of ethanol to water was decreased below 1. When the proportion of water in the reaction increased, the white precipitate formed much faster, indicating a higher rate of nucleation. When the volume of water was 40 mL, polyhedron granules sized approximately 40 nm were obtained. These granules began to show partial interconnection, with a small minority of the crystals accreting. Then, when the volume of water was increased to 60 and 80 mL, small nanosized polyhedrons of lengths less than 10 nm that were intergrown and could not be separated by ultrasound were observed, as shown in Figure 2. It should be noted in the XRD diagrams in both Figures 1 and 2 that, as the ratio between ethanol and water decreased, the peaks became lower and wider, indicating smaller crystal sizes of the MOF-801 crystals. This is coherent with our observations from the SEM that decreasing the ratio led to a fall in crystal size. Furthermore, we used the Debye-Scherrer equation to calculate the sizes of all these crystallites [15]. When the ratios of ethanol to water were 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 3, and 4, the corresponding crystal sizes were 9, 13, 39, 121, 294, and 536 nm, respectively, derived from the Debye-Scherrer equation. This supports our observation from the SEM. The exception of the shape of the MOF-801 should be noted when the solvent ratio was 2.

Hence a calculation which assumes that this difference in entropy is zero, as is in a simple Ising model in which the entropy difference vanishes by symmetry 14 , cannot capture this temperature shift in a dilute solution. I now address the question as to whether the contribution to the shift in transition temperature due to the partitioning of the solute, the last term in Eq. (24), is the dominant one. The first term in Eq. (24) can certainly be ignored compared to the last for the case of a biological membrane. The change in area per lipid 12,13 between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases is about \u2206a = 0.2nm 2 . Further, the surface tension decreases on the addition of solute, and this decrease cannot be larger than the surface tension itself. In cells 15 , this is on the order of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 k B T /nm 2 . Thus in order for the first term in Eq. (24) to be greater than the last, the difference in mol fractions of the solute in the two phases would have to be less than 1 \u00d7 10 \u22123 . There remains to discuss only the terms in Eq. (24) proportional to changes in chemical potential differences \u2206(\u00b5 i \u2212 \u00b5 p ), i = 1, ...p \u2212 1. It would appear that these quantities are not controlled in the experiment, and to this extent, the change in transition temperature upon addition of alcohol is not a well-defined quantity; i.e. by varying these chemical potentials upon addition of the alcohol, one could vary the shift in transition temperature at will. Nevertheless it is reasonable to assume that, except for the addition of the short-chain alcohol, the composition of the giant plasma membrane vesicles utilized by Gray et al. 4 are essentially the same as vesicles without alcohol. Therefore with the exception of the change in chemical potential of all solvent components brought about by the entropy of the solute, Eq.

As the solution-phase ethanol concentration increases, \u0394G ads for ethanol becomes less favorable. Again, two factors contribute to this change: aggregation of ethyl tails makes the solution phase more hospitable, and, once the micropores are filled by ethanol, additional adsorption in the mesopore leads to an unfavorable environment for the ethyl group.

Accordingly, the value of \u03bb is around 0.764 \u03bcm. Thus, when the ratio is 2, the temperature change should be 4.6 \u00b0C. This is different from the value observed in Figure 3, which was over 1 \u03bcm. What is the reason for this difference? Maillard et al. reported that this formula should only be used for quantitative estimations [11]. The difference in surface tension could be less than 50 mN/m due to impurities.

It still exists, but it no longer dominates. When the ratio of ethanol to water reaches 3, the temperature change drops to 0.8 \u00b0C. This causes the characteristic wavelength to become larger. The MOF-801 single crystals formed in this way are much larger due to larger distances between each stream of the Marangoni convection. On the other hand, when the ratio becomes 1, the temperature change rises to 7.6 \u00b0C. Thus, \u03bb is much smaller, resulting in relatively smaller sizes of the MOF-801 crystals. These nanosized MOF-801 crystals also easily interconnect because of the smaller distances between each stream of convection. In both of these cases, the role that the Marangoni flow plays no longer dominates.\n\nAt this point, we want this work to help further research gain insight into the role that ethanol plays in the synthesis of MOFs.

The amount of alcohol in a homeopathic remedy is adjusted following the different homeopathic pharmacopoeias but it is rarely below 30% v/v, which is a molar mass established to meet both Hahnemann's traditional heritage and the hypothetical role of ethanol in \"imprinting\" water, through the formation of nanobubbles, with the homeopathic activity of the remedy. This article aims at discussing the role of ethanol in homeopathic dilutions and how its chemical nature should affect the experimental approach in homeopathy. While the content of ethanol in a homeopathic remedy should be as low as 20% v/v, which is a molar fraction able to catalyze the formation of nanobubbles in a dynamized alcohol-water dilution, this amount raises concern about ethanol toxicology in the experimental research with laboratory animals or in vitro. Several authors diluted 1:100 ethanol 30% v/v from their tested homeopathic dilutions with distilled water to prevent the cytotoxic effect of the alcohol, but in doing so, they probably reduced the ability of ethanol (now 0.3% v/v) to induce the formation of nanobubbles, thus probably affecting the homeopathic property of the same dilution. This may generate concerns about how to manage an experimental setting, to meet both the \"chemical\" nature of ethanol and its role in \"homeopathy,\" an issue that is discussed in the article. Any author working with homeopathic dilutions containing a molar fraction of ethanol higher than 20% should take into account the fact that ethanol is cytotoxic and may be a catalyst to the formation of nanobubbles, and so should adjust the experimental approach accordingly.",

Guo 15 reported that in a microwave discharge with a power of 700 W, the energy yield of hydrogen production from a mixture of air and ethanol was 38.5 mol(H 2 )/kW h. However, due to the greater possible productivity, hydrogen production from a mixture of water and ethanol is the most interesting. Because ethanol needs to be produced and its quantity is limited, efforts should be made to obtain as much hydrogen as possible from the ethanol used. Water is readily available and cheap. Therefore, currently, in commercial-scale steam reforming of natural gas, excess water is used to improve the use of natural gas. This paper presents the effect of water content in the mixture introduced into the reactor on the efficiency of hydrogen production. The water content is an important parameter affecting steam reforming of various substrates. A novelty is a study of ethanol steam reforming in the spark discharge in a wide range of water/ethanol molar ratios. So far, the influence of this parameter on the ethanol steam reforming process in the spark discharge has not been studied. The studies were carried out in a stoichiometric mixture, i.e., a water/ethanol molar ratio equal to 3, with excess water (water/ ethanol molar ratio equal to 4, 5, and 6) and water deficiency (water/ethanol molar ratio equal to 2). The aim was to confirm that an increase in the water/ethanol molar ratio reduces coke production. In contrast, a decrease in this ratio increases the energy efficiency of hydrogen respectively.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS",

A barometer is a glass tube that is closed at one end, filled with a nonvolatile liquid such as mercury, and then inverted and immersed in a container of that liquid. The atmosphere exerts pressure on the liquid outside the tube, the column of liquid exerts pressure inside the tube, and the pressure at the liquid surface is the same inside and outside the tube. The height of the liquid in the tube is therefore\nproportional to the pressure exerted by the atmosphere.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.4 In a barometer, the height, $h$, of the column of liquid is used as a measurement of the air pressure. Using very dense liquid mercury (left) permits the construction of reasonably sized barometers, whereas using water (right) would require a barometer more than 30 feet tall.\n\nIf the liquid is water, normal atmospheric pressure will support a column of water over 10 meters high, which is rather inconvenient for making (and reading) a barometer. Because mercury ( Hg ) is about 13.6-times denser than water, a mercury barometer only needs to be $\\frac{1}{13.6}$ as tall as a water barometer-a more suitable size. Standard atmospheric pressure of 1 atm at sea level ( $101,325 \\mathrm{~Pa}$ ) corresponds to a column of mercury that is about 760 mm (29.92 in.) high. The torr was originally intended to be a unit equal to one millimeter of mercury, but it no longer corresponds exactly. The pressure exerted by a fluid due to gravity is known as hydrostatic pressure, $p$ :\n\n$$\np=h \\rho g\n$$\n\nwhere $h$ is the height of the fluid, $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity.",

These include uncertainty in the density of mercury, about 20 ppm; in the gravitational constant, about 10 ppm, and in the end standards, about 2 ppm.\n\nThe original plan for the NBS gas thermometer was to measure the ratio of the pressures generated in the gas thermometer at two temperatures, one of which would approximate the ice point (later refined to the more precise triple point of water). By fixing the number of moles of gas involved and using the ratio technique, Stimson and his colleagues planned to employ a more advanced form of eq (3) to evaluate the unknown temperature in thermodynamic terms, relative to the first. Initial NBS discussions probed the possibility of using a gas-bulb material made of an alloy whose thermal expansion might be nearly zero over a limited range of temperature. They also considered the relative advantages of utilizing a working gas of known non-ideality, versus the technique of making measurements over such an extended range of filling pressures that an extrapolation to zero pressure might be valid.

Hg22+(g) also forms, and it is a stable species due to the relativistic shortening of the bond. Hg2(g) does not form because the 6s2 orbital is contracted by relativistic effects and may therefore only weakly contribute to any bonding; in fact, Hg\u2013Hg bonding must be mostly the result of van der Waals forces, which explains why the bonding for Hg\u2013Hg is weak enough to allow for Hg to be a liquid at room temperature.",

We considered that following that step, as the magma ocean cools down, it equilibrates with the Ca-Mg-rich sulfides at a slightly lower temperature than during core formation (2000 K instead of 2230 K). Since S solubility in silicate melt decreases at lower temperature (Namur et al. 2016a \n= ( * ( + ) + * * )/( + + ) (8) = * (1 \u2212 ) + * * (9)\nIn this case, we consider that the magma ocean becomes sulfide-saturated as soon as it cools down right before its crystallization. If sulfide saturation happens at a later stage, only a fraction of the BSM would equilibrate with sulfides, and resulting bulk Cr/Al would be closer to the one calculated in the sulfide-free models (Fig. 9a). We considered a log fO2 range from IW-6 to IW-4. The lower limit was based on the super-chondritic bulk sulfur (similarly to scenario 2, Boujibar et al. 2019) and the upper limit was fixed at IW-4 because of the low fO2 required to permit the presence of stable Mg-Ca-rich sulfides (Namur et al., 2016a). We fixed the temperature at 2000 K (Boukar\u00e9 et al., 2019) and we assumed that the sulfide phase contained 20 wt% Mg and 45 wt% S, i.e., the average composition of Mg-Ca-rich sulfides in Namur et al.

For all three scenarios, since there are significant uncertainties related to partition coefficients ( / , / , and / ), surface Cr surface measurements ( ), and crustal thickness, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to account for these errors. Random numbers were generated from normal distributions, which yielded 10 7 models for Mercury differentiation for each of the considered combinations of fO2 and sulfide mass fraction.

In the present study, the temperature dependence of the rate coefficient for the OH + CH3OH reaction, k(T), has been revisited and additional experimental and computational data are reported. New kinetic measurements were performed to fill the existing gaps (&lt;22 K, 22-42 K and 88-123 K), reporting k(T &lt; 20 K) for the first time. The lowest temperature ever achieved by a pulsed CRESU has been obtained in this work (11.7 K). k(T) abruptly increases by almost 2 orders of magnitude from 177.5 K to around 100 K. At T &lt; 100 K, this increase is less pronounced, reaching the capture limit at temperatures below 22 K. The pressure dependence of k(T) has been investigated for selected temperatures and gas densities (1.5 \u00d7 1016 to 4.3 \u00d7 1017 cm-3), combining our results with those previously reported. No dependence was observed within the experimental uncertainties below 110 K. The high- and low-pressure rate coefficients, kHPL(T) and kLPL(T), were also studied in detail using high-level quantum chemical and theoretical kinetic methodologies, closely reproducing the experimental data between 20 and 400 K. The results suggest that the experimental data are near the high pressure limit at the lowest temperatures, but that the reaction remains a fast and effective source of CH2OH and CH3O at the low pressures and temperatures prevalent in the interstellar medium.",

In the specific cases of melting and freezing, it's called enthalpy of fusion or heat of fusion. If the molecular bonds in a crystal lattice are strong, the heat of fusion can be relatively great, typically in the range of 6 to 30 kJ per mole for water and most of the metallic elements. If the substance is one of the monatomic gases, (which have little tendency to form molecular bonds) the heat of fusion is more modest, ranging from 0.021 to 2.3 kJ per mole. Relatively speaking, phase transitions can be truly energetic events. To completely melt ice at 0 \u00b0C into water at 0 \u00b0C, one must add roughly 80 times the thermal energy as is required to increase the temperature of the same mass of liquid water by one degree Celsius. The metals' ratios are even greater, typically in the range of 400 to 1200 times. And the phase transition of boiling is much more energetic than freezing. For instance, the",

Mercury's surface lavas are unlike any others observed in the solar system. They are very low in Fe (and essentially FeO-free), sulfurrich, and highly enriched in alkalis (Table 2.1). From crater size-frequency distributions it has been estimated that these volcanic deposits formed between 4.2 and 3.5 Ga (Marchi et al., 2013;Byrne et al., 2016; Chapter 6 and 9). The oldest volcanic rocks are found in the intercrater plains and heavily cratered terrain (IcP-HCT), and the youngest are found in smooth plains deposits, including the large expanse at high northern latitudes (Head et al., 2011;Chapter 6). A number of researchers have used petrologic modeling and experiments to infer candidate mineralogies and infer the melting conditions and mantle source compositions for the surface lavas Charlier et al., 2013;Namur et al., 2016a;Vander Kaaden et al., 2017). One approach to this methodology, discussed in detail in Chapter 7, relates various geochemical terranes to the overall geological history of Mercury. In this section, The low multiple saturation point pressures indicate shallow depths of melt segregation (~ 60 km) within Mercury. The most straightforward mechanism for producing these high extents of melting would be batch adiabatic decompression melting. By this mechanism, a parcel of mantle ascends in a mantle plume or as a mobile blob (Figure 2.5), it cools slightly as its temperature follows the adiabatic gradient (0.3 o /km), and it begins to melt at the depth where the adiabat intersects the solidus. The primary control on melt production is the temperature of the upwelling mantle; this effect on melting is illustrated in Fig. 2.5 for two different adiabatic paths. Magma is produced by the conversion of internal heat to heat of fusion. As a parcel of mantle continues to rise, melting continues and melt is extracted and transported upwards until a depth is reached at which the temperature of the parcel of mantle is lower than the solidus temperature for the residuum, i.e., the material",

The surface was decomposed using a many-body expansion. Accurate two-body potentials for HgBr, HgAr, and ArBr were calculated using coupled cluster theory with single and double excitations and a perturbative treatment of triple excitations [CCSD(T)], as well as the multireference averaged coupled pair functional method. Correlation consistent basis sets were used to extrapolate to the complete basis set limit and corrections were included to account for scalar and spin-orbit relativistic effects, core-valence correlation, and the Lamb shift. The three-body potential was computed with the CCSD(T) method and triple-zeta quality basis sets. Quasiclassical trajectories using the final analytical potential surface were directly carried out on the CID of HgBr by Ar for a large sampling of initial rotational, vibrational, and collision energies. The recombination rate of Hg and Br atoms is a likely first step in mercury depletion events that have been observed in the Arctic troposphere during polar sunrise. The effective second order rate constant for this process was determined in this work from the calculated CID rate as a function of temperature using the principle of detailed balance, which resulted in k(T) = 1.2 x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 260 K and 1 bar pressure.",

The drop in pressure is apparently due to the oxidation of mercury vapour in the bulb. The oxide then distils out and condenses in the colder part of the apparatus, more mercury vapour diffuses in and the process goes on continuously. By keeping the tap between the bulb and the mercury surface closed between readings, the difficulty was overcome and no further drop in pressure was noticed.\n\n(3) A further difficulty was met with in connection with the use of tap grease on the tap mentioned above. Blank experiments showed a slow but appreci able absorption of oxygen by the ordinary type of grease, consisting of rubber, paraffin, and vaseline.

A gas and several condensed phases of single, double, and triple layers of lying-down molecules are found, depending on n and T. At high coverages, the alkanes studied here show transitions from a triple to a double to a single layer with increasing temperature. The transition temperature from a double to a single layer is found to be approximately 5 degrees C, lower than the bulk rotator-to-liquid melting temperature, while the transition from a triple to a double layer is about as much below the double-to-single layer transition. Both monolayer and bulk transition temperatures show a linear increase with n with identical slopes of approximately 4.5 degrees C/CH2 within the range of n values addressed here. It is suggested that the film and bulk transitions are both driven by a common cause: the proliferation of gauche defects in the chain with increasing temperature.",

For the first model where sulfides are absent (Fig. 8a), these calculations were applied for a range of log fO2 from IW-7 to IW-2. In the context of Mercury's core-mantle differentiation, sulfides are known to form as immiscible phases when the metal phase is enriched in Si (Morard & Katsura, 2010) or C Dasgupta et al., 2009). Indeed, the immiscibility field shrinks at higher pressure (> 15 GPa) while pressure at Mercury's core-mantle boundary (5.5 GPa) is low enough to allow for a large range of compositions where FeS-and FeSior FeC-rich liquids are immiscible. In addition, Mercury's bulk S reaches the upper estimates of S abundances in chondrites at IW-7, because of increased S solubility in magmas at low fO2 (Namur et al. 2016a). The addition of sulfides at IW-7 would yield a sulfur abundance higher than in chondrites. Therefore, here we considered the possible presence of sulfides for models where the log fO2 is between IW-6 and IW-2 (Fig. 8b).",

Nevertheless, relatively few thermodynamic data other than dissociation constants (K) for a few dozen of these complexes have been determined experimentally at elevated temperatures and pressures. The calculations summarized below are intended to supplement these experimental data by providing interim predictions of the thermodynamic properties of supercritical aqueous metal complexes using the revised HKF (Helgeson et al., 1981) equations of state for aqueous species (Tanger and Helgeson, 1988; Shock et al., 1992) and correlations among equations of state parameters and standard partial molal properties at 25 degrees C and 1 bar (Shock and Helgeson, 1988, 1990; Shock et al., 1989). These equations and correlations permit retrieval of the conventional standard partial molal entropies (mean S0), volumes (mean V0), and heat capacities (mean C0P) of aqueous metal complexes at 25 degrees C and 1 bar from published values of log K in the supercritical region and the limited number of experimental dissociation constants available in the literature over relatively short ranges of elevated temperature at PSAT (PSAT and SAT are used in the present communication to refer to pressures corresponding to liquid-vapor equilibrium for the system H2O except at temperatures &lt;100 degrees C, where they refer to the reference pressure of 1 bar). The standard partial molal properties computed in this way can then be used to generate corresponding values of delta mean S0, delta mean V0, and delta mean C0P of association, which for similar complexes correlate linearly with mean S0, mean V0 and mean C0P, respectively, of the constituent cations and ligands at 25 degrees C and 1 bar. Generalizing these correlations and combining them with the equations of state permits prediction of the temperature and pressure dependence of log K and other thermodynamic properties of a large number of aqueous metal complexes. As a consequence, it is possible to retrieve values of log K at 25 degrees C and 1 bar from the results of hydrothermal experiments at higher temperatures and pressures or to predict values of log K at hydrothermal conditions when no experimental data are available at temperatures and pressures above 25 degrees C and 1 bar. Such predictions can be made for temperatures and pressures from 0 degrees C and 1 bar to 1000 degrees C and 5000 bars.",

Electron detachment from SF6(-).\nDetailed statistical rate calculations combined with electron capture theory and kinetic modeling for the electron attachment to SF(6) and detachment from SF(6)(-) [Troe et al., J.

A new method to calculate the specific detachment rate constants k(det)(E) and the electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon) as functions of the total energy E of the anion and the energy epsilon of the emitted electrons is presented, which is computationally simple but neglects fine structures in the detailed k(det)(E). Reduced electron energy distributions f(E,epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) were found to be of the form (epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;)(n) exp(-epsilon/&lt;epsilon&gt;) with n approximately = 0.15, whose shape corresponds to thermal distributions only to a limited extent. In contrast, the average energies &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; can be roughly estimated within thermionic emission and finite heat bath concepts. An effective temperature T(d)(E) is determined from the relation E - EA = &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; + kT(d), where &lt;E(SF(6))(T(d))&gt; denotes the thermal internal energy of the detachment product SF(6) at the temperature T(d) and EA is the electron affinity of SF(6). The average electron energy is then approximately given by &lt;epsilon(E)&gt; = kT(d)(E), but dynamical details of the process are not accounted for by this approach. Simplified representations of k(det)(E) in terms of T(d)(E) from the literature are shown to lead to only semiquantitative agreement with the equally simple but more accurate calculations presented here. An effective \"isokinetic\" electron emission temperature T(e)(E) does not appear to be useful for the electron detachment system considered because it neither provides advantages over a representation of k(det)(E) as a function of T(d)(E), nor are recommended relations between T(e)(E) and T(d)(E) of sufficient accuracy.",

This combined methodology is shown to be instrumental towards revealing the temperature-dependent structural motifs in Au nanoclusters of sizes 90, 147, and 201 atoms. The reported phenomenology is particularly rich, displaying a size- and temperature-dependent competition between the global energy minimum and other structural motifs. In the case of Au<sub90</sub and Au<sub147</sub, the global minimum is also the dominant structure at finite temperatures. In contrast, the Au<sub201</sub cluster undergoes a solid-solid transformation at low temperature (&lt;200 K). Results indicate that PTMD and HSA very well agree at intermediate temperatures, between 300 and 400 K. For higher temperatures, PTMD gives an accurate description of equilibrium, while HSA fails in describing the melting range. On the other hand, HSA is more efficient in catching low-temperature structural transitions. Finally, we describe the elusive structures close to the melting region which can present complex and defective geometries, that are otherwise difficult to characterize through experimental imaging.",

Nevertheless, it is convenient to tag a structure with an average thermal conductivityk (the average is performed by analytically integrating Eq. 12 over the system width or length):k is a well-defined quantity, but it should not be used in a diffusion equation (such as Fourier's law) in an attempt to reconstruct a temperature profile.\n\nIn Fig. 4, we plotk as a function of the crystal size at room temperature and contrast our results with the commonly used Surf-RTA modeling of surface effects. Our approach preserves the qualitative behavior of the Surf-RTA:k goes to zero in the small crystal limit and reaches bulk values for large sizes with a smooth transition in between the two cases. Such intermediate region, which is the most relevant to estimate the impact of nanostructuring on  Another comparison with the Surf-RTA is shown in Fig. 5, where we plot the average thermal conductivity as a function of temperature, together with the bulk conductivity.\n\nIn agreement with conventional expectations, the impact of surfaces is the largest at low temperatures: here our theory has the largest departure from Surf-RTA estimates. In fact, at smaller temperatures more Umklapp processes are frozen out [6], impeding heat flux dissipation by phonon scattering events and thus giving rise to more pronounced collective effects, which can only be captured by the exact solutions of the LBTE [30]. As temperature is increased, the conductivity slowly reduces the deviation from the bulk limit, although even at 1000K our estimate ofk still differs from the bulk value or from the Surf-RTA estimate, even more so considering that a log-log scale is used. Although not shown in detail, we stress that the difference between our approach and the Surf-RTA also depends on the crystal size chosen; Fig. 4 is specific to a system of size 4 \u00b5m. We also stress that all the concepts exposed in this model of surface scattering don't rely on the dimensionality: although we compared with the Surf-RTA in a 2D system, we expect similar trends to hold in 3D materials as well.",

We also stress once more that in deriving this equation we have assumed that the flow of the electron liquid is laminar, i.e., we are far from the onset of a turbulent regime [14,15]. Obviously, in writing Eq. (37) we have assumed that some thermodynamic quantities like temperature and entropy for an electron liquid flowing in a nanostructure can be defined. This is a much debated point, and obviously we do not have a general solution for it. However, here we argue that the electron temperature may be defined as the one ideally measured by a probe weakly coupled to the system and in local equilibrium with the latter [2]. While this operational definition may not be simple to realize in practice, we know from experiments that local heat generation due to current has a large effect on the stability of nanostructures [9]. From the form of Eq. (37) we can deduce a general relation between the applied bias and the electron temperature. To do this, we realize [7] that the electron fluid velocity, v, (which is generally smaller than the Fermi velocity [22]) responsible for the transport of current and heat is, in linear response, proportional to the bias V . 4 This simple proportionality, and the usual result that k \u221d c V , bring us to the general result\nT e = \u03b3 ee V,(38)\nwhere \u03b3 ee is a constant whose expression in terms of microscopic parameters of the electron liquid has been recently derived for a quasi-adiabatic connection between the leads and the nanojunction [7] \n\u03b3 ee = 1.16 \u00d7 G nA c d \u2212 1 3d \u03b7 \u03b3 (39)\nwhere G is the conductance of the system in the limit of zero bias, A c its cross section, d is the dimensionality (d > 1).

Here S \u2261 V th /\u2206T , where V th is the thermovoltage developed in response to a temperature difference \u2206T . For this, they detected, similarly as in Ref. [8] and, more recently, Ref. [9], the thermovoltage generated across a pair of quantum point contacts (QPCs) with a heated electron gas between them. Then \u2206T was estimated as V th /S, where S was obtained using the Mott relation [10]: \nS = \u03c0 2 k 2 B T 3e 2 d ln \u03c3 dE E=\u00b5 .(1)\nHere k B is the Boltzmann constant, e is the electronic charge, \u2261 h/2\u03c0 with h being Planck's constant, \u03c3 is the electrical conductivity, E is the total energy and \u00b5 is the chemical potential. This technique has been used to measure \u03ba in quantum wires [5,11] and energy-loss rates in 2DEGs [12]. Chickering et al. [13] showed Eq. 1 to be broadly valid in gated regions of a 2DEG between 0.8 K and 2 K and therein suggested the possibility of using a symmetric pair of bar-gates as a thermometer for the local T e . This method was recently employed to measure S in mesoscopic 2DEGs [14][15][16]. Usefully, the relatively large size of the bar-gates eliminates the need for electron beam lithography which simplifies the fabrication process. However, it was noted in Ref. [13] that the data systematically deviated from the Mott prediction. Rojek et al. [1] attributed these deviations to the spatial extent of the BGTs being comparable to the energy relaxation length in the 2DEG and developed a model to account for this. In this manuscript, we adapt the model developed by Rojek et al. to refine the analysis of the signal produced by a BGT, and to make an accurate measurement of .

The simplest problem involves quantum particles localized within the 'groove', a quasi-1D region created by two adjacent, identical and parallel nanotubes. At low temperature (T), the transverse motion of the adsorbed gas, in the plane perpendicular to the axes of the tubes, is frozen out. Then, the low T heat capacity C(T) of N particles is that of a 1D classical gas: C(*)(T) = C(T)/(Nk(B)) --&gt; 1/2. The dimensionless heat capacity C(*) increases when T \u2265 0.1T(x, y) (transverse excitation temperatures), asymptoting at C(*) = 2.5. The second problem involves a gas localized between two nearly parallel, co-planar nanotubes, with small divergence half-angle \u03b3. In this case, too, the transverse motion does not contribute to C(T) at low T, leaving a problem of a gas of particles in a 1D harmonic potential (along the z axis, midway between the tubes). Setting \u03c9(z) as the angular frequency of this motion, for T \u2265 \u03c4(z) \u2261 \u03c9(z)\u0127/k(B), the behavior approaches that of a 2D classical gas, C(*) = 1; one might have expected instead C(*) = 1/2, as in the groove problem, since the limit \u03b3 \u2261 0 is 1D. For T &lt;&lt; \u03c4(z), the thermal behavior is exponentially activated, C(*) \u223c (\u03c4(z)/T)(2)e(-\u03c4(z)/T). At higher T (T \u2248 \u03b5(y)/k(B) \u2261 \u03c4(y) &gt;&gt; \u03c4(z)), motion is excited in the y direction, perpendicular to the plane of nanotubes, resulting in thermal behavior (C(*) = 7/4) corresponding to a gas in 7/2 dimensions, while at very high T (T &gt; \u0127\u03c9(x)/k(B) \u2261 \u03c4(x) &gt;&gt; \u03c4(y)), the behavior becomes that of a D = 11/2 system.

In the hotter region, the system behaves like the (totally) asymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP), and experiences particle blockage in front of the interface to the critical region. To explain this particle density accumulation near the interface, we have measured the steady-state current in the KLS model at T&gt;T_{c} and found it to decay as 1/T. In analogy with TASEP systems containing \"slow\" bonds, we argue that transport in the high-temperature subsystem is impeded by the lower current in the cooler region, which tends to set the global stationary particle current value. This blockage is induced by the extended particle clusters, growing logarithmically with system size, in the critical region. We observe the density profiles in both high- and low-temperature subsystems to be similar to the well-characterized coexistence and maximal-current phases in (T)ASEP models with open boundary conditions, which are respectively governed by hyperbolic and trigonometric tangent functions. Yet if the lower temperature is set to T_{c}, we detect marked fluctuation corrections to the mean-field density profiles, e.g., the corresponding critical KLS power-law density decay near the interfaces into the cooler region.",

The CO 2 gas is heated using a cylindrical cell made of solid Cu, which incorporates a 4 mm long nozzle of 0.6 mm diameter. The cell itself has an internal diameter of 10 mm and a length of 12 mm, with a quartz fibre. The cell is heated by wrapping a resistive coaxial sheath wire around it, and can reach temperatures up to about 850 K. A magnetic shield, placed around the cell, prevents the field generated by the heater, around which there is wrapped a pipe with flowing water that provides an outer cooling jacket, from penetrating into the interaction region. A thermocouple was set in to a small hole on the cell, and can serve to monitor the cell temperature. From an earlier experiment [12] that produced a gas phase C 60 beam, it has been confirmed that the gas temperature of the cell can be estimated approximately to be the same as that for the CO 2 beam at the collision centre (~1.5-2 mm from the cell nozzle exit). While sweeping the electron impact energies over the range 1-9 eV, the excitation function experiments were carried out at the respective energy loss values of 0.083 eV and -0.083 eV and at the scattering angles of 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0.

Analytically, this problem has been studied by calculating the relaxation rate gamma(q) of the normal modes of vibration as a function of its wave vector q. Two theoretical studies of classical chains, one using the mode-coupling formulation and the other the Boltzmann equation method, led to gamma(q) proportional to q(5/3), which is consistent with alpha = 0.4.

We have characterized the energetic and structural properties of unsupported neutral Aln (2 &lt;or= n &lt;or= 65) particles (clusters and nanoparticles) via molecular dynamics quenching simulations with a recently validated many-body analytic potential. For each particle size (n), the global minimum-energy structure, the distribution of the local energy minima, and the finite-temperature thermodynamics have been calculated, the latter by evaluating approximately 100,000 rovibrational partition functions for the low-energy isomers of the various particles. This analysis demonstrates that the dominant structures of clusters and nanoparticles depend on temperature as well as particle size and that one must consider statistical mechanics as well as electronic structure in determining the dominant structures, stabilities, and properties of nanoparticles. As a particularly dramatic example, although the electronic magic numbers of Aln are n = 13, 19, 23, 38, and 55 when thermal energy is neglected, the n = 38 magic number is found to become unstable relative to its neighbors (n = 37 and 39) at temperatures of 500 K and above due to vibrational energy and entropy effects. Furthermore, an energy-landscape analysis based on the probability of finding an isomer demonstrates that for many particle sizes, the global-minimum-energy structure on the potential energy surface is not the dominant structure at moderate temperatures, and other low-energy isomers may be dominant at temperatures as low as room temperature. For example, the four lowest-energy structures account for less than 50% of the population for n = 17, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 41-43, 50, 56, 58, and 63-65 at 300 K and for n = 10, 11, and 17-65 at 1500 K.

The increased importance of higher-energy structures at finite temperatures has important implications for understanding the size-selective reactivity and catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles. The isomeric energy (EIso), which is the difference between the thermal average energy of the particle and that of the corresponding global minimum structure in the ground electronic state, is introduced as an indicator of how well the thermochemical properties of a multi-isomer particle can be represented by those of the global minimum structure.

This condition guarantees local equilibrium, i.e. E + i = E \u2212 i . This balance leads to defining the temperature as T \u223c E \u00b1 .

In the case where \u03b1 = 2, the equivalent mean free path is \u03b4x since thermalization occurs at the lattice scale. v plays the role of the thermal speed.

We find that the mean FPT (MFPT) for folding has a U (or V)-shaped dependence on the temperature with a minimum at a characteristic optimal folding temperature T(opt). The optimal folding temperature T(opt) is located between the thermodynamic folding transition temperature and the solidification temperature based on the Lindemann criterion for the solid. Both the T(opt) and the MFPT decrease when the energy bias gap against nonnative contacts increases. The high-order moments are nearly constant when the temperature is higher than T(opt) and start to diverge when the temperature is lower than T(opt). The distribution of FPT is close to a log-normal-like distribution at T &gt; or = T(opt). At even lower temperatures, the distribution starts to develop long power-law-like tails, indicating the non-self-averaging intermittent behavior of the folding dynamics. It is demonstrated that the distribution of FPT can also be calculated reliably from the derivative of the fraction not folded (or fraction folded), a measurable quantity by routine ensemble-averaged experimental techniques at dilute protein concentrations.",

Temperature responses that have sub-Kelvin temperature changes and sub-ls transient features impose a variety of experimental challenges such as the need for amplification hardware with extremely high speed sampling and resolution, along with rapid settling times.

In obtaining \u03b3 ee we have assumed an inelastic mean free path \u03bb e of 1 \u00b5m, a value in line with the expectations for this system [44]. We have also assumed that the electron density that enters the local heating is the one of the chemical bonds between the D and Pt atoms. This density is estimated to be close to the Pt bulk density, n = 6.6 \u00d7 10 28 m \u22123 which gives the electron constant r s \u2243 3.

This means that the Pt-D 2 -Pt system heats up more than the Au QPC. For instance, at 0.1 V the ions of the Pt-D 2 -Pt junction have an average temperature of about 130 K while at the same bias the gold atoms heat up locally to about 54 K. This larger temperature is reasonable since, while the conductance is similar for a Au point contact and Pt-D 2 -Pt, the D 2 molecule is lighter than Au with a consequent increase of the electron-phonon coupling. In addition, the modes of the D 2 molecule have lower probability to elastically scatter into the bulk modes of Pt -thus reducing lattice heat dissipation into the bulk electrodes -than the modes of a single Au atom into the bulk modes of Au. Both effects lead to a higher local ionic temperature. We thus expect the Pt-D 2 -Pt junction to be more unstable under the same bias conditions than a Au point contact, i.e., we expect that the chain Pt-D 2 -Pt breaks,",

It was demonstrated that there was only one phase in the reaction system in the absence of CO2. The reaction system underwent two-phase--&gt;three-phase--&gt;two-phase transitions with increasing pressure. The pressure of CO2 or the phase behavior of the system affected the equilibrium conversion of the reaction markedly. As the pressure was less than 3.5 MPa, there were two phases in the system, and the equilibrium conversion increased as pressure was increased. In the pressure range of 3.5-9.5 MPa, there existed three phases, and the equilibrium conversion increased more rapidly with increasing pressure. As the pressure was higher than 9.5 MPa, the reaction system entered another two-phase region and the equilibrium conversion was nearly independent of pressure. The total equilibrium conversion was 64% without CO2 and could be as high as 80% as pressure was higher than 9.0 MPa. The apparent equilibrium constants (K(x)) in different phases were also determined, showing that the K(x) in the middle phase or top phase was much greater than that in the bottom phase.",

This parameter characterizes the electronic structure of semiconductors and the efficiency of photon absorption is related to its value [86]. E g can be defined in different ways as the fundamental gap, optical gap, electronic gap, and HOMO-LUMO gap. The fundamental gap is defined as the difference in energy between the first electron affinity (EA) and the first ionization potential (IP), according to the equation [87]:\nE g (fund) = EA \u2212 IP(49)\nThe optical gap is the energy of transition between the ground state and the first excited state. Its value is close to the value of E g (fund) and it can be described by the equation [87]:\nE g (opt) = EA \u2212 IP \u2212 E b (50)\nwhere E b is the exciton formation energy significantly lower in comparison with E g (fund). The band gap can be also defined as a difference between the top of valence band (E VB ) and the bottom of the conduction band (E CB ), which can be denoted as the HOMO-LUMO band gap or the mono electronic band gap [87]:\nE g (mono) = E CB \u2212 E VB(51)\nIn the case of solids, it can be assumed that E g (fund) is almost equal to E g (mono).

The positions of the curve were adjusted by aligning the Ti 4+ 2p core level. This allows us to quantitatively compare the change in band gap reported by others to the change in valence band, presuming the conduction band is unaffected by N doping [11]. Due to its formal Ti 4+ oxidation state, pure TiO 2 primarily has a filled O 2p derived valence band separated from an empty Ti 3d, 4s, and 4p derived conduction band by a bulk bandgap of 3.2 eV [20]. The valence-band spectra show the emission from the O 2p band, and visual examination reveals two features in the N doped sample: a tailing of the valence-band maximum to higher kinetic energy, and an impurity state just above this maximum compared to undoped TiO 2 . The tail like state is attributed to the N 2p level since the binding energy of N 2p is less than O 2p thus extending the valence-band maximum to lower binding energy. However, the shift observed in the valence band (of about 0.3 eV) is not enough to explain the observed red shift observed in optical absorption spectra reported (of about 0.5-0.8 eV) by several groups [10,13,14].",

There are three molecular orbitals above the HOMO and below LUMO + 3 in the putative band gap, which are the LUMO, LUMO + 1, and LUMO + 2, all containing anti-bonding \u03c0 * C = C combinations of the bipyridine rings and unoccupied Ru 4d orbitals; see Table 2 and Figure 7. The LUMO + 2 is 0.3 eV below the \"conduction band edge\" MO (L + 3). These MO energy levels are similar to the calculations of Persson and Lundqvist [30], where the penultimate MO in the band gap was 0.2 eV below the conduction band edge in the much larger (TiO 2 ) 38 NP. Thus, the ground state electronic structure in our model is similar to the N3-(TiO 2 ) 38 model [30] except for the fact that our MO energies are shifted up ca. 1.5 eV because of the negative charge on the complex.

In graphs of the electronic band structure of solids, the band gap generally refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron, which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, then current can flow (see carrier generation and recombination). Therefore, the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a",

Band Theory - \nIn order to conduct electricity, electrons must move from the filled valence band to the empty conduction band where they can move throughout the solid. The size of the band gap, or the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, determines how easy it is to move electrons between the bands. Only a small amount of energy is required in a conductor because the band gap is very small. This small energy difference is \"easy\" to overcome, so they are good conductors of electricity. In an insulator, the band gap is so \"large\" that very few electrons move into the conduction band; as a result, insulators are poor conductors of electricity. Semiconductors conduct electricity when \"moderate\" amounts of energy are provided to move electrons out of the valence band and into the conduction band. Semiconductors, such as silicon, are found in many electronics.\n\nSemiconductors are used in devices such as computers, smartphones, and solar cells.

The heterostructures used in this study were produced on the basis of N-doped TiO 2 . The difference absorption spectrum for N-doped TiO 2 is represented at Figure 7a.

This can lead to the accelerated photodegradation of the dye on the surface of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide when illuminated at a 500-nm wavelength. In addition, the doped material of the photocatalyst itself absorbs radiation at the wavelength of 500 nm (used for the measurement), which can also lead to the observed effect. Samples of TiO 2 -WO 3 , TiO 2 -MoO 3 and TiO 2 -MoO 3 -WO 3 more effectively absorb light in the visible region than N-doped TiO 2 . The difference between the absorption spectra of these nanoheterostructures and pure titanium dioxide in the visible region is shown at Figure 7b, but there is a clear dip in their absorption spectra in the range of 420 to 540 nm. Therefore, the illumination of such samples at a 500-nm wavelength should not lead to a significant photocatalytic effect. Although all three of these structures can effectively absorb radiation with the wavelength of~575 nm, this means that in their electronic spectrum there are states that could be acceptors for non-radiative energy transfer from the dye molecules.",

Ab initio DFT calculations of the electronic gap for a-TiO2 give results in the range 2.2-2.85 eV The various models proposed [45,48] agree that in a crystalline to amorphous transition (called an Anderson transition [54]), some of the extended levels of energy (which are valid for the whole crystal, with a finite contribution for conductivity, described by Bloch wave functions) must be replaced by localized electron states, which can be described by wave functions that are confined to a few atoms. Away from the central atom, the wave function amplitude decreases exponentially as exp(\u2212a r), in which a is the inverse localization length. Therefore, these electrons cannot contribute significantly to conductivity [48]. These localized electron levels seem to be concentrated near the top E V of the valence band and in the bottom E C of the conduction band (see Figure 3), creating tails that extend the valence and conduction bands, reducing effectively the electronic band gap [55,56]. According to some experimental evidence, smaller gaps have been measured for successively more disordered systems [46].\n\nAb-initio calculations for a-TiO 2 , showing the similarity of shape of the electronic density of states in the conduction band of amorphous and crystalline TiO 2 phases, have also been reported [50,[57][58][59][60].

Between these two monoclinic forms and the already deposited in the Protein Data Bank P2 1(\u03b2) (PDB code: 1EV6; [28]), an unusual crystal packing for the P2 1(\u03b3) polymorph is noteworthy. While P2 1(\u03b2) , consists of six molecules per asymmetric unit, and 48% solvent content, according to Matthews Coefficient calculation [75,76], the novel P2 1(\u03b3) polymorph contains twelve molecules per asymmetric unit and 39% solvent content (Matthews coefficient = 2.03 \u00c5 3 \u00b7Da \u22121 ). This difference between the cell contents among the two polymorphs, reveals a denser crystal packing in the case of P2 1(\u03b3) which could be of great pharmacological importance.",

This study mainly focuses on two points, namely the crystal properties, and the in vitro and in vivo characterizations of drug crystals during the nanosizing process. We used glyburide, an oral type 2 diabetes (T2D) medication, as our model drug. We sought to reduce the crystalline size of this drug and evaluate its absorption properties by comparing it with the original coarse drug because of previous reports about its gastrointestinal absorption insufficiency. Glyburide crystals, ranging from 237.6 to 4473\u00a0nm were prepared successfully by jet milling and media milling. The particle sizes and the crystal morphology were analyzed by characterization of the solid states, equilibrium solubility, and dissolution behavior. Additionally, pharmacokinetic study was performed in SD rats. The solid state results indicated a loss in crystallinity, amide-imidic acid interconversion, and partial amorphization during nanosizing. Further, in in vitro tests, nanocrystal formulations remarkably increased the solubility and dissolution of the drug (compared to microcrystals). In the in vivo test, reducing the particle size from 601.3 to 312.5\u00a0nm showed no improvement on the C <submax</sub and AUC <sub(0-36\u00a0h)</sub values, while a profound slowing of the drug elimination occurred with reduction of particle size. Further reduction from 312.5 to 237.6\u00a0nm lead to a significant increase (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) of the AUC <sub(0-36\u00a0h)</sub from 6857.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0369.3\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup-1</sup\u00a0h to 12,928.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01591.4\u00a0ng\u00a0mL<sup-1</sup\u00a0h, respectively, in rats.

The main peak at 2.2 (\u00b10.5) MDa in the mass-distribution clearly corresponds to relatively uniform spherical particles, while the smaller less welldefined peaks at higher molecular weights frequently arise from multiple nanoparticles sticking together (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the mass values of peaks 3 and 4 are also close multiples of 2.23 MDa. SAPNs with a particle mass of 2.23 MDa must be formed by approximately 180 peptide chains, implying that they have a T = 3 icosahedron-like structure with a predicted diameter of 25 nm (Fig 1D, bottom). This is in good agreement with the 27 or 28 nm average diameter indicated by TEM and DLS for SAPNS under close to physiological conditions. The second peak in the massdistribution, 3.8 (\u00b10.5) MDa, implies the presence of particles with approximately 300 peptide chains, which may explain the somewhat elongated structure of some SAPNs. This might be an infrequent unique structure or, as evident for some of the projections, arise from the association of two lower mass SAPNs.

These substances seem to enhance the activity of the immune system, but today there is no accepted mechanism, and not even any agreement on the parameters which influence the activity. Therefore, glucans with different structures and/or varying molar mass were characterized by multi-angle laser-light scattering coupled with size-exclusion chromatography in order to obtain the molar mass distribution and to gain an idea of the structure in solution. After ensuring that all samples were free of pyrogens, the Tumour-necrosis-factor-alpha release activity and the superoxide-anion released from human blood monocytes were measured in groups of samples with comparable polydispersity and degree of substitution. All glucans investigated, regardless of molar mass and solution structure, stimulate the investigated immunological measures more than a commercially available biomedical drug used for comparison. The greatest magnitude of molar mass was found to be about 550,000 g/mol for all the glucans investigated.

The compounds displayed thermotropic multilamellar phases. In the gel phase, DMMA formed also a crystalline phase of orthorhombic symmetry, and DMME an interdigitated phase. The gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature T(c) of DMMA depended on the storage and hydration conditions, a precooled sample having a T(c) around 45 degrees C, and a freshly prepared sample around 33 degrees C. In contrast, the phase transition temperature for the gel to liquid crystalline phase of DMME was always found at 24 degrees C. Surface pressure isotherms of the lipids on water and buffer showed that DMMA covers only a small surface area (approximately 35A(2)) whereas DMME requires 50 A(2) of space on the surface. Films of DMMA can be compressed up to a maximum compressibility Pi(max) of 54 mN m(-1) whereas the tilted DMME forms less stable films with Pi(max) of 34 mN m(-1).

The structure of co-crystals of WGA (isolectin 1: WGA1) with a bivalent sialoglycopeptide fragment of glycophorin A (T5), determined at 2.0 A resolution, has been further refined and analyzed with respect to ligand-induced changes in the tertiary structure, mobility, solvation, saccharide conformation and protein/saccharide interactions at three independent N-acetyl-D-neuraminic (NeuNAc) binding sites. The final model, which includes the two independent WGA1 monomers (composed of domains A, B, C and D), two positions for bound T5 sialo-tetrasaccharide (NeuNAc-alpha 2,3-Gal-beta 1,3-(alpha 2,6-NeuNAc)GalNAc) and 386 water molecules, refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 17.1% (Fo &gt; 1.0 sigma) and an average temperature factor of 31.99 A2. Comparisons between the tertiary structures of the liganded and unliganded WGA1 dimers indicate that the largest deviations from 2-fold symmetry are localized in domains engaged in sugar binding (B1 and C2) and at the C-terminal domain of monomer II (D2), forming a strong lattice contact. Interactions of the tetrasaccharide with amino acid ligands in the three binding sites and with water were carefully analyzed and compared. Bound conformations of terminal NeuNAc match to within a root-mean-square delta r of 0.3 A. The specificity-determining N-acetyl group superimposes best in comparison with other substituents of the sugar ring. Of the five domain binding sites that are not occupied in this dimeric crosslinked complex, only one is accessible to the NeuNAc monosaccharide as determined from a difference Fourier map at 3.0 A resolution.",

Dissociation followed by re-association leads to the formation of a blend of various macromolecular topologies, where the cyclic species make up a significant fraction. In this study, the molecular properties of these nanosized cyclic structures of (1--&gt;3)-beta-D-glucans were probed using a combination of AFM and SEC-MALLS. The cyclic structures were obtained by subjecting linear triple-helical molecules of (1--&gt;3)-beta-D-glucans to a denaturation-renaturation cycle, and the fraction of cyclic structures in the renatured sample was determined by AFM. Samples containing different known fractions of linear and circular molecules were studied by SEC with online multi-angle laser-light scattering and viscometric detectors. The molecular weight and the radius of gyration of the molecules eluting from the SEC column, as well as the concentration and the intrinsic viscosity, were determined simultaneously. By extrapolating the results to a situation of only circular species, the results allowed to determine the linear mass per unit length (M(L)) of not only the linear but also the circular morphologies of the (1--&gt;3)-beta-D-glucans. The values obtained were M(L)=2140+/-180 g mol(-1)nm(-1) for the circular species and 2045+/-80 g mol(-1)nm(-1) for the linear species. This is the first direct determination of the M(L) parameter of the circular topology, and the results indicate that the reassociation of the individual chains yield a triplex structure also for the circular morphology, similar to the initial triple helix.",

Given the possibilities that the valence electrons can exchange momentum with the lattice during the excitation or that the electron-electron interaction is more efficient for heavy ions as the electron clouds are compressed during the collision, the maximum energy transferred will be greater than the value shown above and consequently the threshold velocity will be below that range [27].\n\nFrom this discussion and the experimental data shown in section IV, it can be concluded that the main electron emission mechanism will be KEE for the present ion energy range.\n\nAn ion entering a solid will lose energy to the medium.

For specimens thicker than a few tens of nm, the image intensity and scattering contrast are likely to be higher than at lower voltage, as is the visibility of ionization edges below 1000eV (as required for EELS elemental analysis). In thick (&gt;100nm) specimens, higher voltage ensures less beam broadening and better spatial resolution for STEM imaging and EDX spectroscopy. Low-voltage (e.g. 30kV) TEM or STEM is attractive for a very thin (e.g. 10nm) specimen, as it provides higher scattering contrast and fewer problems for valence-excitation EELS. Specimens that are immune to radiolysis suffer knock-on damage at high current densities, and this form of radiation damage can be reduced or avoided by choosing a low accelerating voltage. Low-voltage STEM with an aberration-corrected objective lens (together with a high-angle dark-field detector and/or EELS) offers atomic resolution and elemental identification from very thin specimens. Conventional TEM can provide atomic resolution in low-voltage phase-contrast images but requires correction of chromatic aberration and preferably an electron-beam monochromator. Many non-conducting (e.g. organic) specimens damage easily by radiolysis and radiation damage then determines the TEM image resolution. For bright-field scattering contrast, low kV can provide slightly better dose-limited resolution if the specimen is very thin (a few nm) but considerably better resolution is possible from a thicker specimen, for which higher kV is required. Use of a phase plate in a conventional TEM offers the most dose-efficient way of achieving atomic resolution from beam-sensitive specimens. ",

Like all matter, electrons have both wave and particle properties (as theorized by Louis-Victor de Broglie), and their wave-like properties mean that a beam of electrons can be focused and diffracted much like light can.

However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a \u00b4 of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of \u00b0{\u2122 to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing \u00b3 is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to \u0394 . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 \u00b5m, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016].

Lowering the accelerate voltage has been suggested to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of small-molecular-weight proteins (&lt;100\u2009kD). However, the detection efficient of current Direct Detection Devices (DDDs) and temporal coherence of cryo-EM decrease at lower voltage, leading to loss of SNR. Here, we present an electron counting algorithm to improve the detection of low-energy electrons. The counting algorithm increased the SNR of 120-kV and 200-kV cryo-EM image from a Falcon III camera by 8%, 20% at half the Nyquist frequency and 21%, 80% at Nyquist frequency, respectively, resulting in a considerable improvement in resolution of 3D reconstructions. Our results indicate that with further improved temporal coherence and a dedicated designed camera, a 120-kV cryo-electron microscope has potential to match the 300-kV microscope at imaging small proteins.",

Electron pulse generation\n\nThe development of the electron source and the generation of ultrafast electron pulses played a vital role in the establishment of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The developments that are being carried out on the electron source focus on the enhancement of the temporal and spatial coherent resolution to capture faster dynamics of matter with higher resolution.\n\nSpatial coherence, which is defined through the maximum distance between two objects for which interference is still visible on the screen, is a critical parameter of the electron source and is determined by the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths of the source (see Section 3). On the other hand, the temporal resolution is defined by the electron pulse duration and the phase stability at the interaction stage. Both the temporal and spatial resolutions are reduced by the space-charge effect due to Coulomb repulsion of electrons in the wave packet [114], as discussed earlier in Section 2. The electron beam intensity requirements for the source are more difficult to define, since they depend on the sample under study, namely on the phase (i.e., solid, gas), the thickness, which should be in the range of 10-100 nm, and the background. Nevertheless, at least ~ 10 4 -10 5 electrons per pulse are needed to clearly resolve the diffraction peak and/or obtain a clear image in UED and UEM, respectively [18]. From the theoretical modelling and experimental study, it is obvious that it is impossible to use the conventional electron gun parameters to attain sub-ps electron pulses at the sample position with reasonable electron number densities [114][115][116]. In the pioneering work by Siwick and Miller on implementing a compact electron gun design, 600 fs pulse durations with up to 10,000 electrons per pulse were achieved [22]. This paved the way for the development of a source of high-brightness electron beams with pulse durations on the order of hundred femtoseconds, based on Radio Frequency (RF) compression [96,102,117], which will be discussed later.\n\n\n.

The same point is illustrated by the plot of W d /D e as a function of the temperature in Fig. 8(b), where D e is the diffusion coefficient for hydrated electron [60]. On the other hand, the activation energy for the recombination constant, W r , is much lower, 8.3\u00b11 kJ/mol (which is equivalent to ca. 3 kT at 25 o C). Apparently, while the dissociation of the (OH:e aq -) pair is diffusion controlled, the recombination of \"caged\" partners is not.

The reaction radius R eff estimated using eq.

The model, therefore, predicts that bulk rxn. (2) is diffusion controlled, contrary to the results of ref. [16]. It is not presently clear, whether this discrepancy is significant. The estimates by Elliot and Ouellette [16] were obtained from a global fit to a complex kinetic scheme that involved >5 other reactions occurring on the same time scale.

We now turn to the discussion of the figures given in the first section of the paper for the velocity curves in the various materials. For the airvelocity curve Geiger deduced from his results the formula V3 = aR, where V is the velocity, a a constant and R the range of the a-particles emerging from the absorbing foil. Putting in the value 6'94 for the total range at 15\u00b0 and 76 cm.

The electric field E(t) = \u2212\u2202 A/\u2202t and the vector potential A(t) of such a pulse are depicted in figure 1(a). At time near 'a' where the electric field strength is large, an electron is released by tunneling ionization. Schematically, this electron is first accelerated to the right ( figure 1(b)), but it may be driven back in the next half cycle to recollide with the target ion, at time near 'b'. At the time of recollision near 'b', the returning electrons have energies of about 3.17 U P . Here U P is the ponderomotive energy, i.e. the mean quiver energy of an electron in a laser field. For electrons that are rescattered into the forward directions (the left-side of figure 1(b)) by the target ion, they will be decelerated by the laser field in the next half cycle and emerge at low energies. These rescattered electrons would carry structural information on the target. However, low-energy electrons on this side are also generated by tunneling ionization near 'a', about half a cycle after 'a'. These electrons would have energies up to about 2 U P , and would interfere with the forward rescattered electrons to damage the diffraction images. On the other hand, electrons that are rescattered into the backward directions will be accelerated by the laser field in the next half cycle and end up at much higher energies of up to about 10 U P [12]. In LIEM, we analyze only the momentum images of these high-energy electrons that have been rescattered into the backward directions. Their momentum images are not complicated by the laser field, and differential elastic scattering cross-sections of the ion by free electrons can be extracted. We note that these high-energy electrons have been observed previously [13]. In the calculated laserinduced electron momentum spectra of H 2 + , clear diffraction minima have also been identified at high energies [8]. These high-energy electrons are well understood as due to backscattering of the returning electrons in the laser field [12]. In this paper, we demonstrate quantitatively that it is possible to extract differential elastic scattering cross-sections by free electrons from these laser-induced high-energy electrons. The extracted quantities are independent of the lasers and they form the basis of LIEM.",

As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, electron microscopes have a higher resolving power than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50 pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000\u00d7 whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200 nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000\u00d7.

It is highly desirable to develop a strategy for maximizing and extracting the coherent image component, thereby allowing the projected specimen mass density to be directly related to image intensities. For this purpose, we previously used exit wavefront reconstruction to understand the nature of image formation for thick biological specimens in conventional TEM. Because electron energy-loss filtered imaging allows the contributions of inelastically scattered electrons to be removed, it is potentially advantageous for imaging thick, biological samples. In this paper, exit wavefront reconstruction is used to quantitatively analyse the imaging properties of an energy-filtered microscope and to assess its utility for thick-section microscopy. We found that for imaging thick biological specimens (&gt; 0.5 microns) at 200 keV, only elastically scattered electrons contribute to the coherent image component. Surprisingly little coherent transfer was seen when using energy-filtering at the most probable energy loss (in this case at the first plasmon energy-loss peak). Furthermore, the use of zero-loss filtering in combination with exit wavefront reconstruction is considerably more effective at removing the effects of multiple elastic and inelastic scattering and microscope objective lens aberrations than either technique by itself. Optimization of the zero-loss signal requires operation at intermediate to high primary voltages (&gt; 200 keV). These results have important implications for the accurate recording of images of thick biological specimens as, for instance, in electron microscope tomography.",

The hydration state of all Mg sulfate hydrates changes in response to local temperature and humidity conditions. Based on recently reported equilibrium relative humidities and the new standard properties described above, the internally consistent thermodynamic database for the MgSO(4)\u00b7nH(2)O system was refined by a mathematical programming (MAP) analysis. As can be seen from the resulting phase diagrams, starkeyite is metastable in the entire T-%RH range. Due to kinetic limitations of kieserite formation, metastable occurrence of starkeyite might be possible under martian conditions.",

Answer: - \n$\\Delta H=-338 \\mathrm{~kJ}$\n\nEnthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A standard state is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M , and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm . Because the $\\Delta H$ of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure ( $1 \\mathrm{bar}=0.987 \\mathrm{~atm}$ ), $\\Delta H$ values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted \" o \" in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K , this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol $\\left(\\Delta H^{\\circ}\\right)$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol $\\Delta H$ is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)\n\nThe enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the extensive nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the $\\Delta H$ for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property $(\\Delta H)$ by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount intensive value of $\\Delta H$, often \"normalized\" to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)",

Previous NMR diffusion experiments have demonstrated that the stacking behaviour of G-quartets and thus the length of the stacks are not modulated by temperature in the range between 278 and 298 K 32 . To yield information about the thermal stability of the hydrogen bonds formed in dimers and G-quartets of 5\u2032-GMP, we performed temperature-dependent FTIR measurements for 0.48 M Na 2 5\u2032-GMP at pH 8 (Fig. 2). IR spectra of both the carbonyl band and the ring vibrations change markedly with increasing temperature, indicating dissociation of the dimers and G-quartets (Fig. 2a). Upon temperature increase, the carbonyl band shifts from 1673 to 1657 cm \u22121 and broadens. In the case of the ring vibrations, the band intensities at 1592 and 1537 cm \u22121 decrease at elevated temperatures, whereas the bands at 1582 and 1568 cm \u22121 show increased intensities and slight red shifts. To better describe the \"melting\" behaviour, we plotted the band intensities at 1673, 1592, 1568 and 1537 cm \u22121 as a function of temperature (Fig. 2b). The \"melting\" curves follow the same course, indicating that any of those bands can be used to follow the self-association of 5\u2032-GMP. Assuming an apparent thermodynamic equilibrium between all the hydrogen-bonded and the monomer stacks, a global Boltzmann fit of the IR data was performed. We obtained a melting temperature of T m = 281 \u00b1 2 K and a standard-state van't Hoff enthalpy change of \u2206H vH 0 = 124 \u00b1 8 kJ mol \u22121 for the dissociation reaction of Na 2 5\u2032-GMP.

The observed rate coefficient, k1, was found to exhibit a negative temperature dependence with both pressure dependent and pressure independent components, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the rate coefficient k1 was found to be enhanced in the presence of elevated H2O or CH3OH concentrations, as reported previously. This study reports the most extensive characterisation of the rate coefficient k1 as a function of T, p, [H2O] and [CH3OH]. The present results indicate that k1 is higher at low temperatures, and that enhancement of k1 by H2O is greater, than has been reported previously. The pressure dependence of k1 at ambient temperature is in good agreement with previous studies. The rate enhancement by CH3OH reported here is in good agreement with previous studies at ambient temperatures but is smaller at low temperatures than the most recent previous investigation suggests. The rate coefficient k1 is adequately parameterised by: k1(760 Torr) = {(1.8 +/- 0.8) x 10(-14) exp((1500 +/- 120)/T/K)} x {1 + (2.0 +/- 4.9) x 10(-25) [H2O] exp((4670 +/- 690)/T/K)} x (1 + (0.56 +/- 1.00) x 10(-21) [CH3OH] exp((2550 +/- 500)/T/K)} cm(-3) molecule(-1) s(-1), where [H2O] and [CH3OH] are in molecules cm(-3).

The rate constant of the OH + SO<sub2</sub reaction is calculated here by using beyond-CCSDT correlation energy calculations for a benchmark, validated density functional methods for direct dynamics, canonical variational transition state theory with anharmonicity and multidimensional tunneling for the high-pressure rate constant, and system-specific quantum RRK theory for pressure effects; the combination of these methods can compete in accuracy with experiments. There has been a long-term debate in the literature about whether the OH + SO<sub2</sub reaction is barrierless, but our calculations indicate a positive barrier with an transition structure that has an enthalpy of activation of 0.27 kcal mol<sup-1</sup at 0 K. Our results show that the high-pressure limiting rate constant of the OH + SO<sub2</sub reaction has a positive temperature dependence, but the rate constant at low pressures has a negative temperature dependence.

However, the simplified Eq.(1) describes well the signal as can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2. At low temperature (4.2 K) and pressure (0.7 GPa) the cut-off frequency is \u2248 450 Hz; the working frequency was chosen to be slightly higher, keeping in mind that the signal decreases with \u03c9. Changing the temperature and the pressure influences the cut-off frequency: from 1 to 4 K we worked in the range 600-1000 Hz, and from 4 to 12 K between 2000 and 4000 Hz. The specific heat of the sample is certainly the main contribution to the signal. This follows implicitly from the fact that the frequency dependence is well described by Eq.(1) without any correction. However, a convincing argument is presented in Fig. 2, where the specific heat measured at ambient and low pressure (0.7 GPa) are compared. The former curve was obtained with a conventional relaxation technique using a comparatively large sample (14 mg) [9,14] whereas the investigated samples each had a mass of \u2248 10 \u00b5g. The phase transitions are clearly visible. They are also detectable with the ac-technique at 0.7 GPa, but slightly shifted in temperature as expected from the phase diagram [6,9,10,11,12]. The height of the specific heat jump at the second order transition (T N \u2248 9 K) represents 47% of the total signal compared to 51% for the ambient pressure curve. This indicates that the heat capacity measured under pressure is in majority the heat capacity of the sample.",

The reason for the many background terms of higher order in temperature and pressure is that the response functions are second derivatives of the thermodynamic potential. To obtain, for example, a background term in the compressibility of second order in pressure, it is necessary to have a fourth-order pressure-dependent term in the potential. The terms in the backgrounds for each property are at most third order in temperature or in pressure. We want to emphasize that the observed anomalies are indeed due to the critical part of the equation of state since the nonlinear contributions to the regular part are needed only when the maximum pressure considered is higher than about 100 MPa. Besides the background parameters, there are five additional parameters to be determined: the critical temperature T c and volume V c , the linearmodel amplitudes a and k, and the slope of the LLT line a . As noted, the values of T c and a were constrained to a limited range.",

The values of heat capacity below the experimental range of each substance were obtained by extrapolation using a Debye heat-capacity function fitted to the experimental values obtained at the lower temperatures. The evaluation of the thermal properties was done on the IBM 7090 computer at 1-deg intervals up to 75 oK and at 5-deg intervals at the higher temperatures.

The mass stoichiometric yield coefficient \u03b1 2 is increasing from about 0.2 above 300 K and approaching unity around 250 K. \u03b1 2 shows much stronger  temperature dependence than \u03b1 1 and a different functional dependence. The temperature dependence for \u03b1 1 can be approximated with a linear fit while for \u03b1 2 an almost exponential behaviour can be fitted. The physical meaning behind this is however not established. The following parameterisations of the mass stoichiometric yield coefficients (\u03b1 i ) were derived from the individual experiments for the temperature range between 243 and 313 K and for humid conditions:  The sum of \u03b1 1 and \u03b1 2 may approach a maximum value of 1.25 at 243 K if we assume an average molar mass for the SOA of 171 g mol \u22121 , i.e. a SOA composition of 17% product 1 with 186 g mol \u22121 and of 83% product 2 with 168 g mol \u22121 . Please note that at 243 K the SOA yield is at its theoretical limit and the exponential fit exceeds this limit by about 10%. However, considering estimated uncertainties of about \u00b130% for the mass stoichiometric yield coefficients a further interpretation is not reasonable. The value obtained in this work for \u03b1 1 =0.11 at 302 K is significantly lower than the value of \u03b1 1 =0.239 reported by Cocker et al. (2001) but their value of \u03b1 2 =0.169 agrees within the uncertainties with our value of \u03b1 2 =0.22. Empirical fitting to a range of measured data led to values of \u03b1 1 =0.08 and \u03b1 2 =0.42 for 310 K (Svendby et al., 2008). Figures 5 and 6b show that the temperature dependence of the vapour pressures and the corresponding partitioning coefficients follows typical Clausius -Clapeyron behaviour.

The dynamics results were obtained using a potential energy surface obtained with density functional theory using the PW91 functional. The reaction probabilities computed with quantum dynamics for (v = 0,1,j = 0) were in excellent agreement with the QCT results obtained earlier for these states, thereby validating the QCT approach to sticking of hydrogen on Cu(110). The vibrational de-excitation probability P(v=1,j = 0 --&gt; v = 0) computed with the QCT method is in remarkably good agreement with the quantum dynamical results for normal incidence energies E(n) between 0.2 and 0.6 eV. The QCT result for the vibrational excitation probability P(v = 0,j = 0 --&gt; v = 1) is likewise accurate for E(n) between 0.8 and 1 eV, but the QCT method overestimates vibrational excitation for lower E(n). The QCT method gives probabilities for rovibrationally (in)elastic scattering, P(v = 1,j = 1 --&gt; v('),j(')), which are in remarkably good agreement with quantum dynamical results. The rotationally averaged, initial vibrational state-selective reaction probability obtained with QCT agrees well with the initial vibrational state-selective reaction probability extracted from molecular beam experiments for v = 1, for the range of collision energies for which the v=1 contribution to the measured total sticking probability dominates. The quantum dynamical probabilities for rovibrationally elastic scattering of (v = 1,j = 1) H(2) from Cu(110) are in good agreement with experiment for E(n) between 0.08 and 0.25 eV.",

A32, 565-574; Hansen &amp; Coppens (1978). Acta Cryst. A34, 909-921] in experimental X-ray charge-density studies makes use of real spherical harmonics when describing the angular component of aspherical deformations of the atomic electron density in molecules and crystals. The analytical form of the density-normalized Cartesian spherical harmonic functions for up to l \u2264 7 and the corresponding normalization coefficients were reported previously by Paturle &amp; Coppens [Acta Cryst. (1988), A44, 6-7]. It was shown that the analytical form for normalization coefficients is available primarily for l \u2264 4 [Hansen &amp; Coppens, 1978; Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988; Coppens (1992). International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. B, Reciprocal space, 1st ed., edited by U. Shmueli, ch. 1.2. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers; Coppens (1997). X-ray Charge Densities and Chemical Bonding. New York: Oxford University Press]. Only in very special cases it is possible to derive an analytical representation of the normalization coefficients for 4 &lt; l \u2264 7 (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988). In most cases for l &gt; 4 the density normalization coefficients were calculated numerically to within seven significant figures. In this study we review the literature on the density-normalized spherical harmonics, clarify the existing notations, use the Paturle-Coppens (Paturle &amp; Coppens, 1988) method in the Wolfram Mathematica software to derive the Cartesian spherical harmonics for l \u2264 20 and determine the density normalization coefficients to 35 significant figures, and computer-generate a Fortran90 code. The article primarily targets researchers who work in the field of experimental X-ray electron density, but may be of some use to all who are interested in Cartesian spherical harmonics. ",

Phys. Chem. A 111, 2761 (2007)]. The reaction probabilities have been calculated for total angular momentum J up to 105 to obtain the converged integral cross sections over a collision energy range of 0.01-0.345 eV. With the polyatomic system initially in its ground rovibrational state |000&gt;, no obvious resonance signature has been observed in the integral cross sections although it appears in the reaction probabilities for J &lt; or = 40. However, when the umbrella mode of the collision system is initially excited to nu(alpha0) = 1 level, |001&gt; state, there is resonance signature in both the reaction probabilities with J &lt; or = 55 and the integral cross sections. In addition, rate constants are calculated by Boltzmann averaging of the |000&gt; integral cross sections over collision energy and compared with both the previous kinetic calculations and the experimental measurements. A reasonable agreement has been achieved over the investigated temperature range of 180-400 K.",

Answer: - \n$1.9 \\times 10^{-34} \\mathrm{~m}$.\nWe never think of a thrown softball having a wavelength, since this wavelength is so small it is impossible for our senses or any known instrument to detect (strictly speaking, the wavelength of a real baseball would correspond to the wavelengths of its constituent atoms and molecules, which, while much larger than this value, would still be microscopically tiny). The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum. For example, if we improve our measurement of an electron's position so that the uncertainty in the position ( $\\Delta x$ ) has a value of, say, $1 \\mathrm{pm}\\left(10^{-12} \\mathrm{~m}\\right.$, about $1 \\%$ of the diameter of a hydrogen atom), then our determination of its momentum must have an uncertainty with a value of at least",

We calculated the heat of combustion (cal/g) of each standard by monitoring the temperature rise of the water surrounding the bomb. We inspected each run for signs of an incomplete combustion (i.e., soot), and discarded these data. We performed a minimum of 3 complete combustions for each standard and corrected each sample for heat liberated due to the combustion of the fuse wire and formation of nitric acid. To account for heat released due to the formation of nitric acid from the N 2 gas in the bomb chamber, we applied a nitric acid correction of 1.5 cal [Parr-Instrument-Company, 2004] to all runs on samples which did not contain N. When samples did contain N, we determined the nitric acid correction by titrating the bomb washings with $0.07 N Na 2 CO 3 [Parr- Instrument-Company, 2004].

At pH 7.0 in the presence of Mg(2+), the temperature optima for the three soluble enzymes were 85 degrees C (SMGI), 95 degrees to 100 degrees C (TNGI), and &gt;100 degrees C (TMGI). Under certain conditions, soluble forms of the three enzymes exhibited an unusual, multiphasic inactivation behavior in which the decay rate slowed considerably after an initial rapid decline. However, the inactivation of the enzymes covalently immobilized to glass beads, monophasic in most cases, was characterized by a first-order decay rate intermediate between those of the initial rapid and slower phases for the soluble enzymes. Enzyme productivities for the three immobilized GIs were determined experimentally in the presence of Mg(2+). The highest productivities measured were 750 and 760 kg fructose per kilogram SMGI at 60 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively. The highest productivity for both TMGI and TNGI in the presence of Mg(2+) occurred at 70 degrees C, pH 7.0, with approximately 230 and 200 kg fructose per kilogram enzyme for TNGI and TMGI, respectively. At 80 degrees C and in the presence of Mg(2+), productivities for the three enzymes ranged from 31 to 273. A simple mathematical model, which accounted for thermal effects on kinetics, glucose-fructose equilibrium, and enzyme inactivation, was used to examine the potential for high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) production at 80 degrees C and above using TNGI and SMGI under optimal conditions, which included the presence of both Co(2+) and Mg(2+). In the presence of both cations, these enzymes showed the potential to catalyze glucose-to-fructose conversion at 80 degrees C with estimated lifetime productivities on the order of 2000 kg fructose per kilogram enzyme, a value competitive with enzymes currently used at 55 degrees to 65 degrees C, but with the additional advantage of higher fructose concentrations. At 90 degrees C, the estimated productivity for SMGI dropped to 200, whereas, for TNGI, lifetime productivities on the order of 1000 were estimated. Assuming that the most favorable biocatalytic and thermostability features of these enzymes can be captured in immobilized form and the chemical lability of substrates and products can be minimized, HFCS production at high temperatures could be used to achieve higher fructose concentrations as well as create alternative processing strategies.",

The major source of MG is dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is catalyzed by MG synthase (the mgs product) in bacteria. We observed Escherichia coli cell death when the ribose transport system, consisting of the RbsDACBK proteins, was overproduced on multicopy plasmids. Almost 100% of cell death occurs a few hours after ribose addition (&gt;10 mM), due to an accumulation of extracellular MG as detected by (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR). Under lethal conditions, the concentration of MG produced in the medium reached approximately 1 mM after 4 h of ribose addition as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. An excess of the protein RbsD, recently characterized as a mutarotase that catalyzes the conversion between the beta-pyran and beta-furan forms of ribose, was critical in accumulating the lethal level of MG, which was also shown to require ribokinase (RbsK). The intracellular level of ribose 5-phosphate increased with the presence of the protein RbsD, as determined by (31)P-NMR. As expected, a mutation in the methylglyoxal synthase gene (mgs) abolished the production of MG. These results indicate that the enhanced ribose uptake and incorporation lead to an accumulation of MG, perhaps occurring via the pentose-phosphate pathway and via glycolysis with the intermediates fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. It was also demonstrated that a small amount of MG is synthesized by monoamine oxidase.",

The vibrational energy levels were selected by using a semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) quantization procedure while the relative translational energy was sampled from a Boltzmann weighted distribution. The rate coefficient for the formation of the OH + O products is seen to increase monotonically with quantum number and nearly monotonically with temperature. On the MB PES, at T = 1000 K, the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 5.2 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10. For T = 2000 K, this factor drops to 3.3, to 2.9 for T = 3000 K, and to 2.5 for T = 4000 K. On the DMBE IV PES, at T = 1000 K the total rate coefficient increases by a factor of 4.1 as the initial vibrational quantum number of the O(2) diatom increases from v = 6 to v = 10.

The less-direct group (defined below) of trajectories is sensitive to the initial O(2) vibrational excitation in several different temperature ranges, apparently retaining the effect of reagent vibrational excitation. The more-direct group (defined below) of trajectories does not exhibit this behavior. Reagent vibrational excitation does not increase the total rate coefficients for the title reaction more than the increase due to a simple temperature increase. The less-direct and more-direct groups of trajectories differ in their contribution to the rate coefficient for the title reaction. In particular, at T = 4000 K, the two PESs used in this work differ dramatically in the roles of the less-direct and more-direct trajectories. The behavior of the more-direct and less-direct groups of trajectories can be understood in terms of the efficiency of intramolecular vibrational energy transfer. This work utilizes the recently introduced PES Library, POTLIB 2001, which made the comparisons between the two PESs discussed in this work possible in a very straightforward way.",

Qualitatively, heating did not have a statistically significant effect on the mutagenic pattern, except at the major base substitution hot spot, G115, in supF; principally, G115--&gt;T mutations were obtained prior to heating, while after heating, G115--&gt;A and G115--&gt;C mutations became more prevalent. Quantitatively, heating caused an approximately 2-fold decrease in mutation frequency. Heating released a small fraction of adducts (approximately 5%), and the chemistry and implications of this reaction are investigated herein. Although the major adduct of (+)-anti-B[a]PDE (formed at N2-Gua) is generally regarded to be heat stable, it can be quite unstable in double-stranded (but not single-stranded) DNA at low [Mg2+]. Heating releases the corresponding tetraols from (+)-anti-B[a]P-N2-Gua in approximately the same ratio as for simple hydrolysis of (+)-anti-B[a]PDE itself. This and other results suggest that guanine remains in DNA when (+)-anti-B[a]P-N2-Gua adducts are hydrolyzed. [No evidence for any other chemical change in (+)-anti-B[a]PDE adducts was found.] While no general acid/base or nucleophilic catalysis was observed, adduct hydrolysis was specific acid catalyzed down to pH approximately 5.6, where the pH-rate profile showed a break to a slope of approximately 0.0. This break probably indicates the pKa of (+)-anti-B[a]P-N2-Gua protonated at the N2-position, which is higher than expected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The rate coefficient is pressure independent with the following temperature dependence: k(3)(T) = (1.83 +/- 0.48) x 10(-12) exp((560 +/- 70)/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (95% uncertainties). Addition of O(2) to the system leads to recycling of OH. The mechanism was investigated by varying the experimental conditions ([O(2)], [MGLY], temperature and pressure), and by modelling based on a G3X potential energy surface, rovibrational prior distribution calculations and master equation RRKM calculations. The mechanism can be described as follows: Addition of oxygen to the system shows that process (4) is fast and that CH(3)COCO completely dissociates. The acetyl radical formed from reaction (4) reacts with oxygen to regenerate OH radicals (5a). However, a significant fraction of acetyl radical formed by reaction (R4) is sufficiently energised to dissociate further to CH(3) + CO (R4b). Little or no pressure quenching of reaction (R4b) was observed. The rate coefficient for OD + MGLY was measured as k(9)(T) = (9.4 +/- 2.4) x 10(-13) exp((780 +/- 70)/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) over the temperature range 233-500 K.

The obtained steady-state values of the glycerol to ethanol formation ratio (0.1 mol mol(-1)) corresponding to those predicted from the stoichiometric model of fermentative yeast growth showed that the complete repression of respiration was obtained in auxostat culture and that the model is suitable for calculation of Y(ATP) and Q(ATP) values for the aerobic fermentative growth. Smooth decrease in the culture pH and dissolved oxygen concentration (pO2) down to the critical values of 2.3 and 0.8%, respectively, resulted in decrease in growth yield (Y(ATP)) and specific growth rate, however the specific ATP production rate (Q(ATP)) stayed almost constant.

The N + Q content of class II xylose isomerases (XIs) from mesophiles, moderate thermophiles, and hyperthermophiles was examined. It was found to correlate inversely with the growth temperature of the source organism in all cases examined, except for the previously uncharacterized XI from Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 (BLXI), which had an N + Q content comparable to that of homologs from much more thermophilic sources. To determine whether BLXI behaves as a thermostable enzyme, it was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the thermostability and activity properties of the recombinant enzyme were studied. Indeed, it was optimally active at 70-72 degrees C, which is significantly higher than the optimal growth temperature (37 degrees C) of B. licheniformis. The kinetic properties of BLXI, determined at 60 degrees C with glucose and xylose as substrates, were comparable to those of other class II XIs. The stability of BLXI was dependent on the metallic cation present in its two metal-binding sites. The enzyme thermostability increased in the order apoenzyme &lt; Mg2+-enzyme &lt; Co2+-enzyme approximately Mn2+-enzyme, with melting temperatures of 50.3 degrees C, 53.3 degrees C, 73.4 degrees C, and 73.6 degrees C. BLXI inactivation was first-order in all conditions examined. The energy of activation for irreversible inactivation was also strongly influenced by the metal present, ranging from 342 kJ x mol(-1) (apoenzyme) to 604 kJ x mol(-1) (Mg2+-enzyme) to 1166 kJ x mol(-1) (Co2+-enzyme). These results suggest that the first irreversible event in BLXI unfolding is the release of one or both of its metals from the active site. Although N + Q content was an indicator of thermostability for class II XIs, this pattern may not hold for other sets of homologous enzymes. In fact, the extremely thermostable alpha-amylase from B. licheniformis was found to have an average N + Q content compared with homologous enzymes from a variety of mesophilic and thermophilic sources. Thus, it would appear that protein thermostability is a function of more complex molecular determinants than amino-acid content alone.",

Overall, at temperatures of 1826 K &lt; T &lt; 2783 K, the rate constant can be expressed as k(NCN + O) = 9.6 \u00d7 10(13)\u00d7 exp(-5.8 kJ mol(-1)/RT) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) (\u00b140%). As a requirement for accurate high temperature rate constant measurements, a consistent NCN background mechanism has been derived from pyrolysis experiments of pure NCN(3)/Ar gas mixtures, beforehand. Presumably, the bimolecular secondary reaction NCN + NCN yields CN radicals hence triggering a chain reaction cycle that efficiently removes NCN. A temperature independent value of k(NCN + NCN) = (3.7 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10(12) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) has been determined from measurements at pressures ranging from 143 mbar to 1884 mbar and temperatures ranging from 966 K to 1900 K. At higher temperatures, the unimolecular decomposition of NCN, NCN + M \u2192 C + N(2) + M, prevails. Measurements at temperatures of 2012 K &lt; T &lt; 3248 K and at total pressures of 703 mbar &lt; p &lt; 2204 mbar reveal a unimolecular decomposition close to its low pressure limit. The corresponding rate constants can be expressed as k(NCN + M) = 8.9 \u00d7 10(14)\u00d7 exp(-260 kJ mol(-1)/RT) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1)(\u00b120%).",

Qualitatively, heating did not affect the mutagenic pattern, except at the major base substitution hotspot in supF, G115, where principally G--&gt;T mutations were obtained prior to heating, while after heating, G--&gt;A and G--&gt;C mutations became statistically significantly more prevalent. Several studies have suggested that a heat-induced chemical transformation of a (+)-anti-B[a]PDE adduct at G115 (e.g., into an apurinic site) is not likely to explain the change in mutational pattern. The most likely model is that (+)-anti-B[a]P-N2-Gua is initially trapped in a metastable conformation giving principally G--&gt;T mutations, while heating induces a change to a stable conformation(s) resulting in G--&gt;T, A, and C mutations. This suggests that adduct conformational complexity is at the root of adduct mutational complexity. To investigate this model, a plasmid (B[a]P-G115-pRE1) with (+)-anti-B[a]P-N2-Gua in the G115 sequence context is constructed using adduct site-specific techniques.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The enthalpy and heat capacity changes associated with the binding of glucose were found to be nearly zero at both low and high ionic strengths over the temperature range from 7 to 29 degrees C. Thus, the free-energy change, amounting to -5.1 kcal mol(-1) at 25 degrees C and high ionic strength, is nearly independent of the temperature and is primarily of entropic origin. DSC study of the thermal unfolding of the free enzyme at low ionic strength gave an excess heat capacity curve with two maxima. This result appears to reflect a difference in thermal stability of the two domains in the hexokinase molecule which are indicated by X-ray crystallography [Bennett, W.S., &amp; Steitz, T. A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 4848-4852]. In contrast, the unfolding of free enzyme at high ionic strength was fully cooperative. The excess heat capacity curve for the unfolding of the glucose-bound enzyme had only one peak at both low and high ionic strengths. This is consistent with the X-ray result that the binding of glucose induces a conformational change in the enzyme which brings the two lobes into close proximity. It is interesting that such a significant, molecule-wide conformational change is accompanied by only very small net changes in enthalpy and heat capacity.",

This study discusses use of the stimulus response approach to quantitatively study the energetic and metabolic aspects of the transient adaptation of S. cerevisiae to a shift in benzoic acid concentration, from 0 to 0.8 mM. The information obtained also serves as the basis for further utilization of benzoic acid as a tool for targeted perturbation of the energy system, which is important in studying the kinetics and regulation of central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Using this experimental set-up, we found significant fast-transient (&lt; 3000 s) increases in O(2) consumption and CO(2) production rates, of approximately 50%, which reflect a high energy requirement for the adaptation process. We also found that with a longer exposure time to benzoic acid, S. cerevisiae decreases the cell membrane permeability for this weak acid by a factor of 10 and decreases the cell size to approximately 80% of the initial value. The intracellular metabolite profile in the new steady-state indicates increases in the glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle fluxes, which are in agreement with the observed increases in specific glucose and O(2) uptake rates.",

The decline in ribulose 1.5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activity during prolonged heat stress is generally associated with an increase in ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) levels. However, rapid heating caused an initial decline in RuBP which was subsequently followed by a small decline in Rubisco carbamylation. The ratio of RuBP to Rubisco sites declined from a saturating concentration to a sub-saturating concentration, providing a possible mechanism for the decarbamylation of Rubisco. If RuBP is saturating (&gt;1.8 RuBP Rubisco site(-1)), it acts as a cap on the catalytic site and keeps Rubisco activated.

A different type of calorimeter that operates at constant volume, colloquially known as a bomb calorimeter, is used to measure the energy produced by reactions that yield large amounts of heat and gaseous products, such as combustion reactions. (The term \"bomb\" comes from the observation that these reactions can be vigorous enough to resemble explosions that would damage other calorimeters.) This type of calorimeter consists of a robust steel container (the \"bomb\") that contains the reactants and is itself submerged in water (Figure 9.17). The sample is placed in the bomb, which is then filled with oxygen at high pressure. A small electrical spark is used to ignite the sample. The energy produced by the reaction is absorbed by the steel bomb and the surrounding water. The temperature increase is measured and, along with the known heat capacity of the calorimeter, is used to calculate the energy produced by the reaction. Bomb calorimeters require calibration to determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter and ensure accurate results. The calibration is accomplished using a reaction with a known $q$, such as a measured quantity of benzoic acid ignited by a spark from a nickel fuse wire that is weighed before and after the reaction. The temperature change produced by the known reaction is used to determine the heat capacity of the calorimeter. The calibration is generally performed each time before the calorimeter is used to gather research data.\n\n\nFIGURE 9.17 (a) A bomb calorimeter is used to measure heat produced by reactions involving gaseous reactants or products, such as combustion.

These measurements are then used to calculate energy output, metabolic rate (MR), and respiratory quotient (RQ), a relative assessment of carbohydrate and lipid oxidation. By far the most difficult aspect of indirect calorimetry is measurement of O(2). Moreover, the abundance of O(2) (20.95%) relative to CO(2) (0.03%) in ambient conditions dictates that measurement errors of O(2) have greater implications on calculations of MR and RQ. Because compressed air is not feasible for use with animals in long-term experiments, changes in ambient conditions are nearly unavoidable. A self-correcting indirect calorimetry system was designed and constructed utilizing differential O(2) and CO(2) analyzers and a blank cage to monitor ambient conditions periodically. The system was validated by changing ambient O(2) and CO(2) concentrations by infusing N(2) into the system during a test butane burn. MR and RQ were largely unaffected by these changes in ambient conditions, and inclusion of a blank cage in the system accounted for slight calibration offsets. MR and RQ were measured in mice (n = 95) with and without correction for any small changes in ambient conditions measured in the blank cage. Coefficients of variation for MR and RQ were significantly decreased by taking into account ambient conditions measured in the blank cage (P &lt; 0.001), which resulted in a 2.3% increase in precision for measurement of MR. This system will be used to more accurately assess long-term measurements of energy balance in the many murine models of leanness and obesity to gain better insights into pathophysiology and treatment of human obesity.",

A custom \"casting\" method consisted of inserting 1.0000 gram (+/-0.0005g) of prepared earlier propellant into gelatin capsules (medicine capsules). After that, a hole was bored in the capsule and a pyrotechnic fuse was inserted there to make contact with the propellant.

This amount of energy is negligible when it comes to enthalpy change in the calorimeter during combustion of the propellant. The fuse was glued to the capsule, so it does not separate while burning. Glue also protects chemicals from reacting with the outside environment. Enthalpy of the fuse was not included in calculations as well because it was identical (or close to identical) for all the trials.",

According to a recent paper reported by Hasson et al., [J. Phys. Chem., 2004, 108, 5979-5989] this reaction may proceed by three different channels: CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (1a); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OH + O(3) (1b); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)O + OH + O(2) (1c). In experiments, CH(3)C(O)O(2) and HO(2) radicals were generated using Cl-initiated oxidation of acetaldehyde and methanol, respectively, in the presence of oxygen. The addition of amounts of benzene in the system, forming hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals in the presence of OH, allowed us to answer that channel (1c) is &lt;10%. The rate constant k(1) of reaction (1) has been finally measured at (1.50 +/- 0.08) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K, after having considered the combination of all the possible values for the branching ratios k(1a)/k(1,)k(1b)/k(1,)k(1c)/k(1) and has been compared to previous measurements. The branching ratio k(1b)/k(1), determined by measuring ozone in situ, was found to be equal to (20 +/- 1)%, a value consistent with the previous values reported in the literature. DFT calculations show that channel (1c) is also of minor importance: it was deduced unambiguously that the formation of CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)(g)) is the dominant product channel, followed by the second channel (1b) leading to CH(3)C(O)OH and singlet O(3) and, much less importantly, channel (1c) which corresponds to OH formation. These conclusions give a reliable explanation of the experimental observations of this work. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2) is still predominantly a radical chain termination reaction in the tropospheric ozone chain formation processes.",

The experimental data for phm-MDH were obtained in the presence of 1 M concentrations of various salts of monovalent and polyvalent anions, 1 M amino acids or 1 M sucrose and 6.1 M glycerol. Similarly, Arrhenius plot data were obtained for ml-PEPC in the presence of 2.5 M NaOAc and 0.8 M sodium glutamate. Distinct regimes of inactivation corresponding to high and low values of inactivation enthalpy were identified for the phm-MDH in the presence of all cosolvents and for the ml-PEPC in the presence of 2.5 M NaOAc, but not in the presence of 0.8 M sodium glutamate. A significant temperature-dependent effect dominated the inactivation of phm-MDH and ml-PEPC at elevated temperatures (e.g., &gt; or = 45 degrees C), whilst the inactivation of these enzymes over a lower temperature range (&lt; or = 25 degrees C) was dominated by temperature-independent phenomenon. The corresponding thermodynamic activation parameters (deltaG++, deltaH++ and deltaS++) associated with the transition state complexes involved in the inactivation of phm-MDH and ml-PEPC in the presence of the various cosolvents have been determined. The results indicate that the transition states associated with the inactivation of these two enzymes at elevated temperatures are characterised by large, positive enthalpic and entropic changes. In contrast, the inactivation process observed for phm-MDH at low temperatures in the presence of various cosolvents was marked by a large, negative entropic contribution and a small, positive enthalpic contribution. The results obtained in this study indicate that more than one mechanism of inactivation can occur with these two multimeric enzymes depending on the selected temperature range and the type of cosolvent. The relationship of these results to stabilisation models for phm-MDH and ml-PEPC in the presence of various cosolvents, as well as the application of Arrhenius plot data to extrapolate the long term solution stability of these enzymes at lower temperatures from the pseudo-first order rate constants of inactivation experimentally derived over a range of temperatures, are discussed.",

This reaction was observed in a crossed-beams experiment, and the relative excitation function in the region around its energy threshold (50-80 kcal mol(-1)) was measured. Direct dynamics calculations were also performed at two levels of theory, B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and MP2/6-31G(d,p). The shape of the B3LYP excitation function closely matches that of the experiment. The calculations provided a detailed description of the dynamics and revealed a striking dependence of the reaction mechanism on collision energy, where the cross section rises from a threshold near 60 kcal mol(-1) to a peak at approximately 115 kcal mol(-1) and then decreases at higher energies as secondary dissociation of the internally excited HO(2) product becomes dominant. The calculations show that the cross section for H-atom elimination (O + H(2)O --&gt; HO(2) + H) is about 10-25% that of the H-atom abstraction (O + H(2)O --&gt; OH + OH) cross section for collision energies in the 70-160 kcal mol(-1) range.",

To obtain physical insight in our results, we analyze them with a semi-analytical model for two electrons. Thanks to electronic-structure properties such as the one-body density and the particle-hole entropy, we are able to define a path that connects the Wigner regime to the Fermi-gas regime by varying the confinement parameter. In particular, we show that the particle-hole entropy, as a function of the confinement parameter, smoothly connects the two regimes.

However, in the jellium and atomistic calculations the integral does not vanish as a consequence of the distortion of the wavefunctions beyond the box borders, indicating that this type of transitions is allowed.The derivation of the transition selection rule for a particle in a 3D infinite well is contrasted with the selection rule of more realistic models in the SI text.Briefly, the results of that analysis can be summarized as follows.The selection rules for an atomistic cluster with a box-like core shape become the following: (i) such transitions are forbidden where, in the direction of the electric field, the number of nodes is changed by an even number, (ii) in addition, such transitions are forbidden, where one other number of nodes changes by an odd number.In combination, this means that for an allowed transition, exactly in one direction (of the three possibilities) the number of nodes changes by an odd number.Thus, the sum of the nodal multiplicities changes by an odd number (since odd+even+even = odd).Since each delocalized state in the atomic cluster has either an even or an odd number of nodes in each direction x, y, z, there are in total 8 combinations.Non-zero transitions between the states can be organized in an octant-shape \"topography map\", see Figure S2 that also demonstrates again the TCM analysis of the 2.11 eV absorption peak when the occupied and empty states are classified by (odd/even ; odd/even ; odd/even) combinations.\n\nAlthough in this work we focus on the particular case of the box-like [Ag67(SR)32(PR3)8] 3+",

It is a completely quantum phenomenon with no analogues in the classical realm. In addition, it cannot be derived from solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and is not related to the normal spatial coordinates (such as the Cartesian $x, y$, and $z$ ). Electron spin describes an intrinsic electron \"rotation\" or \"spinning.\" Each electron acts as a tiny magnet or a tiny rotating object with an angular momentum, or as a loop with an electric current, even though this rotation or current cannot be observed in terms of spatial coordinates.\n\nThe magnitude of the overall electron spin can only have one value, and an electron can only \"spin\" in one of two quantized states. One is termed the $\\alpha$ state, with the $z$ component of the spin being in the positive direction of the $z$ axis. This corresponds to the spin quantum number $m_{s}=\\frac{1}{2}$.

In diamond they are sp3 and the atoms form tetrahedra with each bound to four nearest neighbors. Tetrahedra are rigid, the bonds are strong, and of all known substances diamond has the greatest number of atoms per unit volume, which is why it is both the hardest and the least compressible.

We show that a geometric constraint-exclusion of head-to-tail dihedral angle discrepancies (DADs)-explains this limited selection as well as successful assembly into such closed cages in the first place. An edge running from a pentagon to a hexagon has a DAD, since the dihedral angles about the edge broaden from its pentagon (tail) end to its hexagon (head) end. Of the 21 configurations of a central face and surrounding faces, six have such DAD vectors arranged head-to-tail.

Carbon clusters studied include fullerenes and fullerene-derived structures (e.g., cages and onions), icosahedral structures, bucky-diamond structures, and clusters cut from the bulk diamond with spherical and facetted truncations.

Excluding C(48)H(24) and C(138)H(42), which have D(3d) minima due to 1,5 H...H repulsions between adjacent perimeter rings, optimized geometries are planar D(6h) minima. Nucleus Independent Chemical Shifts (NICS), at the same level, indicate the presence of individual aromatic rings, which correspond to Clar's qualitative sextets rule (Clar, E. TheAromatic Sextet; Wiley: London, 1972). NICS and the Clar valence electron topologies agree perfectly in the molecule plane; however, the NICS values computed in parallel planes further away from the molecular surface converge, indicating the presence of a uniform magnetic shielding field. For each series, PBH total NICS values (i.e., the sum of NICS values for all rings in the PBH) correlate linearly with the number of carbon atoms, indicating constant magnetic field development within a series. The C-C lengths depend on their proximity to the more olefinic rich molecular perimeters. However, the large PBH (&gt; or =C(48)H(24)) internal C-C distances converge to approximately 1.426 A. In agreement with Clar's rule, HF/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) vertical ionization potentials and B3LYP/6-31G(d) HOMO-LUMO gaps are largest within the \"fully benzenoid\" series, where all carbon atoms are members of a single sextet. The largest members of the four series studied are predicted to exhibit semiconducting properties.",

Diffraction studies have shown that hydrate volume changes significantly (as much as 1.5% over 50 K) as a function of temperature. It has been demonstrated previously via statistical mechanics that a minor change in hydrate volume (e.g., a 1.5% change in volume or 0.5% change in lattice parameter) can lead to a major change in the predicted hydrate formation pressure (e.g., &gt;15% at &gt;100 MPa for methane). Because of this sensitivity, hydrate thermal expansivity measurements, for both Structures I and II with various guests, are needed help quantify volume distortions in hydrate lattices to ensure accurate hydrate phase equilibria predictions. In addition to macroscopic phase equilibria, the thermal expansion of different hydrates can give information about the interactions between the guest molecules and the host lattice. In this work, the hydrate lattice parameters for four Structure I (C2H6, CO2, 47% C2H6 + 53% CO2, and 85% CH4 + 15% CO2) and seven Structure II (C3H8, 60% CH4 + 40% C3H8, 30% C2H6 + 70% C3H8, 18% CO2 + 82% C3H8, 87.6% CH4 + 12.4% i-C4H10, 95% CH4 + 5% C5H10O, and a natural gas mixture) systems were measured as a function of temperature. The lattice parameter measurements were combined with existing literature values. Both sI and sII hydrates, with a few exceptions, had a common thermal expansivity, independent of hydrate guest. Many guest-dependent correlations for linear thermal expansivity have been proposed. However, we present two guest-independent, structure-dependent correlations for sI and sII lattices, which have been developed to express the normalized hydrate lattice parameters (and therefore volume) as a function of temperature.",

In this work, we extend the identification of close packings up to D = 4.00\u03c3 by adapting Torquato-Jiao's adaptive-shrinking-cell formulation and sequential-linear-programming (SLP) technique. We identify 17 new structures, almost all of them chiral. Beyond D \u2248 2.85\u03c3, most of the structures consist of an outer shell and an inner core that compete for being close packed. In some cases, the shell adopts its own maximum density configuration, and the stacking of core spheres within it is quasiperiodic. In other cases, an interplay between the two components is observed, which may result in simple periodic structures. In yet other cases, the very distinction between the core and shell vanishes, resulting in more exotic packing geometries, including some that are three-dimensional extensions of structures obtained from packing hard disks in a circle.

In our current case, we have # 20 bb = adamantanyl building blocks, so that we have # 114 ext = \"external\" modes, turning out to be in the range from ~90 cm -1 to 330 cm -1 (at an average spacing of 2 \u2248 cm -1 ), after which there is a 30 \u2248 -cm -1 gap to the 917 remaining \"internal\" vibrational modes. Here the gap is smaller than for the carborane case evidently because the present strain is less (with an angle off-set of just 1.5\n\u2248 o , vs. 3.2 \u2248 o for our earlier carborane case).\nThere is a simple scheme to aid in the relief of stress --namely to introduceacetylenic linkages between the tetrahedral adamantylunits. That is, each C-C bond between 2 adamantyl building blocks is replaced by an acetylene bridge where the dashed lines on the left & right summarily indicate an adamantane cage. Indeed just such a replacement has been suggested previously, in related contexts: in graphene [14], in cubane [15], in different polyhedranes [16,17] and miscellaneous other carbo-cages [18] (including adamantane). Basically the total stress is reduced because the strain is spread out over3 bonds & 4 bond angles, rather than 1 bond & 2 bond angles, so that with the stress energy quadratic in the strain, the resultant total stress energy should be roughly half as big (from comparing",

Room-temperature diffraction experiments on two samples of irregular shape were carried out on two different diffractometers installed at HASYLAB/DESY, Hamburg, Germany. The structure refinement on the high-energy data converged at R(F) = 0.0047, wR(F) = 0.0038, GoF = 0.78, for a multipole model with neutral atoms and multipole expansions up to seventh order. For each atom, the radial expansion coefficients of the multipole orders (l &gt; 0) were constrained to a common value. The absence of extinction was indicated by a refined correction parameter equalling zero within error limit. The excellent quality of the data is also illustrated by a high-order (HO) refinement (s &gt; 0.7 A(-1)) yielding R(F) = 0.0060, wR(F) = 0.0048, GoF = 0.85. Both static deformation electron-density distribution and structure amplitudes compare well with corresponding results obtained from band-structure calculations using the linearized-augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) method. Ensuing topological analysis of the total model electron density distribution revealed bond critical point properties for the two unique Si--O bonds, indicating a predominantly closed-shell interaction mixed with a significant shared interaction contribution that decreases with increasing interatomic distance. Calculation of atomic basins yielded charges of +3.39 e and -1.69 e for Si and O, respectively, in good agreement with the theoretically calculated values of +3.30 e and -1.65 e. The volumina of the Si and O basins are 2.32 and 10.48 A3, corresponding to spheres with radii of 0.82 and 1.36 A, respectively. The results also conform well with correlations between bond length and bond critical point properties reported in the literature for geometry-optimized hydroxyacid molecules. Estimates of the Si cation electronegativity indicate that the change of Si coordination by oxygen from 4 to 6 is accompanied by an increase of the ionicity of the Si--O bond of about 7%.",

The nonmolecular cubic-gauche (cg-N) structure was first observed above 110\u00a0GPa, coupled to high temperature (&gt;2000\u2009\u2009K) to overcome the kinetic barrier. A mixture of cg-N with a layered phase was afterwards reported between 120 and 180\u00a0GPa. Here, by laser heating pure nitrogen from 180\u00a0GPa, a sole crystalline phase is characterized above 240\u00a0GPa while an amorphous transparent phase is obtained at pressures below. X-ray diffraction and Raman vibrational data reveal a tetragonal lattice (P4_{2}bc) that matches the predicted hexagonal layered polymeric nitrogen (HLP-N) structure. Density-functional theory calculations which include the thermal and dispersive interaction contributions are performed to discuss the stability of the HLP-N structure.",

The three selected compounds are based on [Ta(6)X(12)(H(2)O)(6)](3+) (X=Cl or/and Br) units with edge-bridged Ta(6) octahedral clusters. Although two of them crystallise in the tetragonal space group I4(1)/a, all compounds exhibit a similar arrangement of paramagnetic clusters related to the diamond structural framework (Fd \u03053m space group). Magnetic parameters were fitted by using the [5,4] Pad\u00e9 approximant of high-temperature series expansion of susceptibility for the Heisenberg model (S=1/2) in the diamond framework, assuming only nearest-neighbouring interactions. Such a model appropriately describes magnetic-susceptibility measurements at temperatures T&gt;0.7|J|/k. The magnetic interaction parameter J between two [Ta(6)Cl(12)(H(2)O)(6)](3+) clusters is estimated to be -64.28(7) cm(-1) ; it has been enhanced by replacing several chlorine inner ligands with bromine ones (J=-123(3) cm(-1) for two [Ta(6)Br(7.7(1))Cl(4.3(1))(H(2)O)(6)](3+) clusters) and is strongest between two bromine [Ta(6)Br(12)(H(2)O)(6)](3+) clusters with a value of -155(1) cm(-1) . Broken-symmetry DFT calculations within spin-dimer analysis confirmed this trend. Those interactions can be explained on the basis of the overlap between singly occupied a(2u) orbitals localised on neighbouring clusters.",

Phase transitions were not observed. High-pressure X-ray powder diffraction was measured using a diamond anvil cell and synchrotron radiation. Full Rietveld refinements provided the values of the lattice parameters and the values of the atomic coordinates at each pressure. The bulk modulus is found as K(0) = 70 (5) GPa for Nb3Te4 and as K(0) = 73 (4) GPa for InxNb3Te4. The analysis of the pressure dependences of the detailed crystal structures shows that the compression along c involves the folding up of the quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chains of Nb. The compression perpendicular to c is entirely due to the reduction of the diameter of the channels. The presence of intercalated In atoms is found to have hardly any influence on the compression behaviour up to 40 GPa.",

Assembling process, geometry, and contact networks.\nThis is the first paper of a series of three, in which we report on numerical simulation studies of geometric and mechanical properties of static assemblies of spherical beads under an isotropic pressure. The influence of various assembling processes on packing microstructures is investigated. It is accurately checked that frictionless systems assemble in the unique random close packing (RCP) state in the low pressure limit if the compression process is fast enough, higher solid fractions corresponding to more ordered configurations with traces of crystallization. Specific properties directly related to isostaticity of the force-carrying structure in the rigid limit are discussed. With frictional grains, different preparation procedures result in quite different inner structures that cannot be classified by the sole density. If partly or completely lubricated they will assemble like frictionless ones, approaching the RCP solid fraction Phi_{RCP} approximately 0.639 with a high coordination number: z* approximately =6 on the force-carrying backbone. If compressed with a realistic coefficient of friction mu=0.3 packings stabilize in a loose state with Phi approximately 0.593 and z* approximately =4.5 . And, more surprisingly, an idealized \"vibration\" procedure, which maintains an agitated, collisional regime up to high densities results in equally small values of z* while Phi is close to the maximum value Phi_{RCP}. Low coordination packings have a large proportion (&gt;10%) of rattlers--grains carrying no force--the effect of which should be accounted for on studying position correlations, and also contain a small proportion of localized \"floppy modes\" associated with divalent grains. Low-pressure states of frictional packings retain a finite level of force indeterminacy even when assembled with the slowest compression rates simulated, except in the case when the friction coefficient tends to infinity. Different microstructures are characterized in terms of near neighbor correlations on various scales, and some comparisons with available laboratory data are reported, although values of contact coordination numbers apparently remain experimentally inaccessible.",

[21] the equilibrium crystal structure at density 3 = 5.0 is the diamond structure. In principle, it is possible to think about the structure that we observed as about a strongly distorted diamond structure. In our guessed structure every particle also has 4 nearest neighbors and all these neighbors are at the distance 0.535 from the \"central\" chosen particle. The difference with the diamond structure is in the values of the angles. In the diamond structure all 6 angles associated with the \"central\" atom are equal to 109.5 \u2218 . In our guessed structure 2 angles are equal to 82.1 \u2218 (one can think about them as about two opposite angles), while the other 4 angles are equal to 124.6 \u2218 . Thus the structure that crystallized from the liquid in our simulations is, in some sense, a distorted diamond structure.\n\nFor the density 0 3 = 5.24 the guessed structure, according to the visual analysis, is similar to the one at The symmetry of the solution that the Findsym software [64,65] found for the density 3 = 5.24 is the same as for the density 3 = 5.00.

The comparisons of the PDFs of the crystal structures obtained through the crystallization of liquids with the PDFs calculated on the ideal crystal structures are shown in Fig.6(e,f). It follows from Fig.6(e) that our guess is quite good for the density 0 3 = 5.0 -at least for the first six peaks. On the other hand, in Fig.6(f) there is a splitting of the second peak in the PDF of the crystal structure obtained from the liquids state. Our guessed model, despite being stable on heating, does not capture this splitting. We were not able to come up with a better structural guess and thus, for now, we leave the matter in its current state.",

World records are about 10% faster for underwater swimming vs. surface swimming, but little is known about the advantage of underwater swimming for monofin swimming. Some authors reported that the air-water interface influences the kinematics and leads to a narrow vertical amplitude of the fin. On the one hand, surface swimming is expected to affect drag parameters (cross-sectional area (S) and active drag (AD)) when compared to underwater swimming. On the other hand, the surface swimming technique may also affect efficiency (eta(F)). The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate and compare drag parameters and efficiency during underwater and surface swimming. To this end, 12 international level monofin swimmers were measured during both underwater and surface swimming. Kinematic parameters (both dimensional and non-dimensional), eta(F) (calculated according to the Elongated-Body Theory), and AD (computed with Velocity Perturbation Method) were calculated for an underwater and a surface fin swimming trial, performed at maximal speed. As expected, results showed significantly lower velocities during surface swimming vs. underwater V(1,under) =2.5ms(-1) vs. V(1,surf) =2.36ms(-1), p&lt;.01). Velocities during underwater and surface swimming were strongly correlated (r=.97, p&lt;.01). Underwater swimming was also associated with higher vertical amplitudes of the fin compared to surface swimming (V(under) =0.55mvs. V(surf) )=0.46m, p&lt;.01). Length-specific amplitudes (A(under)/L(b)) were in the order of 20% during underwater swimming as for undulating fish, and significantly higher than during surface swimming (A(surf)/L(b)=17%, p&lt;.01). Efficiency for surface swimming was about 6% lower than for underwater swimming (eta(F,under) =0.79 vs. eta(F,surf) =0.74, p&lt;.01). This decrease could be associated with an increase in swimming frequency for surface swimming (f (surf)=2.15Hz vs. f (under)=2.08Hz, p&lt;.01). Active drag during surface swimming was about 7% higher than for underwater swimming (AD(under) =78.9N vs. AD(surf) =84.7N, p&lt;.01). A significantly smaller cross-sectional area for surface swimming (S(under) =0.053m(2) vs. S(surf) =0.044m(2), p&lt;.01) and higher drag coefficient for surface swimming (C(d,under) =0.47 vs. C(d,surf) =0.69, p&lt;.01) were measured. Finally, correlation between cross-sectional area and vertical amplitude of the fin was reported for both underwater and surface swimming. These results suggest that the performance improvement during underwater swimming is not only linked to a wave drag reduction effect but also to a specific swimming technique due to the free surface.",

A simple relationship in the spirit of the van de Hulst similarity relationships is developed from which the diffuse attenuation coefficient K(infinity) of the asymptotic light field can be obtained from a, b, and the VSF with an error of &lt; 2%. In this relationship, the shape of the VSF is characterized by its asymmetry parameter g, whereas omega(0) = b/c characterizes the other IOP's. The relationship applies approximately to other quantities as well, particularly tau(x), which is the optical depth at which the downwelling irradiance attenuation coefficient K(d) can be replaced by K(infinity) with an error no greater than x%. Computations of tau(5) and tau(10) are presented as a function of g, omega(0) and the incident light field, and it is shown that for overcast conditions K(d) can be within 5% of K(infinity) at depths at which the downwelling irradiance is greater than 50% of its value at the surface. Simulations of radiative transfer in verticall inhomogeneous waters reveal that for sufficiently large depth (z), the value of K(infinity)(z) determined from the asymptotic theory that uses the values of the IOP's at z is a good approximation to K(d)(z). Thus our results suggest that in addition to being a pedagogically interesting concept, the asymptotic theory may actually be useful in ocean optics research.

UV sensitivity may have advantages in the dim, blue light shifted environment experienced by submerged marine mammals. It may also be advantageous when seals are on land as UV is reflected by snow and ice but absorbed by fur, enhancing visual contrast. Here we show that the pelagic hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) has a highly UV permissive cornea and lens. Seals like other carnivores have a tapetum lucidum (TL) reflecting light back through the retina increasing sensitivity. The TL in this seal is unusual being white and covering almost the entire retina unlike that in other carnivores.

Enhanced UV from a large TL surface with a high degree of retinal convergence will increase sensitivity at a cost to acuity. UV electrophysiological retina responses were only obtained to dim, rod mediated stimuli, with no evidence of cone input. As physiological measurements of threshold sensitivity are much higher than those for psychophysical detection, these seals are likely to be more UV sensitive than our results imply. Hence, UV reflections from the TL will afford increased sensitivity in dim oceanic environments. ",

If a black target is used, the inherent contrast is always negative unity, so that the visibility of a black target in the horizontal direction depends on a single parameter only. That is not the case for any other target or viewing arrangement. We thus propose the horizontal visibility of a black target to be the standard for underwater visibility. We show that the appropriate attenuation coefficient can readily be measured with existing simple instrumentation. Diver visibility depends on the photopic beam attenuation coefficient, which is the attenuation of the natural light spectrum convolved with the spectral responsivity of the human eye (photopic response function). In practice, it is more common to measure the beam attenuation coefficient at one or more wavelength bands.

This study aimed to characterize the subjective responses of recreational scuba divers to LFS to ascertain the extent to which LFS may impact their enjoyment, comfort, or time spent underwater. Seventeen male and nine female recreational scuba divers participated. Diving was conducted in an acoustically transparent tank located within a larger anechoic pool. Subjects wore scuba gear and were positioned I m below the surface in a prone position. The sound transducer was located 4 m directly below the diver's head. Sound exposures consisted of three signal types (pure tone, 30 Hz hyperbolic sweep up, and 30 Hz hyperbolic sweep down) each presented at six center frequencies from 100 to 500 Hz and six sound pressure levels(SPL) ranging from 130 to 157 dB re 1 microPa. The duration of each sound exposure was 7 s. Subjects responded via an underwater console to rate aversion to LFS on a category-ratio scale, and to indicate the presence or absence of vibration of any body part. Aversion to LFS and the percent incidence of vibration increased as the SPL increased. The percent incidence of vibration decreased linearly with increasing frequency. At the highest SPL the probability that an aversion rating would exceed Very Severe (7 on the category-ratio scale) was predicted to be 19%. There was no significant difference in aversion among signal types. The 100 Hz frequency was the most aversive frequency (P &lt; 0.05). A plot of aversion vs. frequency showed a U-shaped function with minimum aversion at 250 Hz. In conclusion, diver aversion to LFS is dependent upon SPL and center frequency. The highest aversion rating was given for 100 Hz, this frequency corresponded with the greatest probability of detecting vibration. Factors other than vibration seem to account for aversion to the highest frequencies. Our data suggest that LFS exposures up to 145 dB re 1 microPa at frequencies between 100 and 500 Hz will have minimal impact on the recreational diver.",

Hypoxia did not alter these patterns of depth preference, though one animal made regular excursions toward normoxic water during the light phase. Vertical swimming activity was almost twofold greater during the dark phase and was not affected by hypoxia.

The fluid (water) surrounding the swimmer has density \u03c1 f = 1.0 \u00d7 10 3 kg m \u22123 , viscosity \u00b5 = 1.0 \u00d7 10 \u22123 kg m \u22121 s \u22121 , and relative permittivity r = 78. 36.\n\nIn the diffusiophoretic model, the net flux of solute molecules through the surface of the swimmer is F = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u221213 mol s \u22121 , to ensure that we are in the linear regime. The diffusivity of the active solute is D 0 = 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22129 m 2 s \u22121 for oxygen [47,48]. The interaction between solute molecules and the swimmer surface is given by the slip-layer parameter \u03be = \u22121.0 \u00d7 10 \u221215 m 5 mol \u22121 s \u22121 , see Appendix A. These last two parameters are choices that enable us to compute the speed in the simulation and are based on the values in Ref. [45], but otherwise do not affect our results for the swimming efficiency.",

When the Sun's radiation reaches the sea surface, the shortwave radiation is attenuated by the water, and the intensity of light decreases exponentially with water depth. The intensity of light at depth can be calculated using the Beer-Lambert Law. In clear mid-ocean waters, visible light is absorbed most strongly at the longest wavelengths. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths are totally absorbed at shallower depths, while blue and violet wavelengths reach deeper in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths are absorbed least compared to the other wavelengths, open-ocean waters appear deep blue to the eye.",

Thin filter strips saturated with distilled water or an alcohol-water solution were used as absorbing samples of different thicknesses. The dependence of the power reflection coefficient R(d) on film thickness (d) was not monotonic. R(d) passed through a pronounced maximum before reaching its steady-state level [R(infinity)]. Similarly, absorption, A(d), passed two maximums with one minimum between them, before reaching its steady-state level [A(infinity)]. At 42.25 GHz, A(d) was compared with absorption in a semi-infinite water medium at a depth d. When d &lt; 0.3 mm, absorption by the film increased: at d = 0.1 mm the absorption ratio for the thin layer sample and the semi-infinite medium was 3.2, while at d = 0.05 mm it increased up to 5.8. Calculations based on Fresnel equations for flat thin layers adequately described the dependence of the reflection, transmission, and absorption on d and allowed the determination of the refractive index (n), dielectric constant (epsilon), and penetration depth (delta) of the absorbing medium for various frequencies. For water samples, epsilon was found to be 12.4-19.3j, delta = 0.49 mm at 42.25 GHz, and epsilon = 9.0-19.5j, delta = 0.36 mm at 53.57 GHz. The calculated power density distribution within the film was strongly dependent on d. The measurements and calculations have shown that the reflection and absorption of mm-waves by thin absorbing layers can significantly differ from the reflection and absorption in similar semi-infinite media. The difference in reflection, absorption, and power density distribution in films, as compared to semi-infinite media, are caused by multiple internal reflections from the film boundaries. That is why, when using thin phantoms and thin biological samples, the specifics of the interaction of mm-waves with thin films should be taken into account.",

New measurements extend the observed rotational lines to J=7&lt;--6 for LiOH and J=8&lt;--7 for LiOD for all bending vibrational states up to (03(3)0). Rotation-vibration energy levels, geometric expectation values, and dipole moments are calculated using extensive high-level ab initio three-dimensional potential energy and dipole moment surfaces. Agreement between calculation and experiment is superb, with predicted Bv values typically within 0.3%, D values within 0.2%, ql values within 0.7%, and dipole moments within 0.9% of experiment. Shifts in Bv values with vibration and isotopic substitution are also well predicted. A combined theoretical and experimental structural analysis establishes the linear equilibrium structure with re(Li-O)=1.5776(4) A and re(O-H)=0.949(2) A. Predicted fundamental vibrational frequencies are v1=923.2, v2=318.3, and v3=3829.8 cm(-1) for LiOH and v1=912.9, v2=245.8, and v3=2824.2 cm(-1) for LiOD.

The fit is used to investigate the dissociation dynamics along each potential energy surface for several initial geometries corresponding to Franck-Condon transition from neutral or singly ionized water molecule. For each case, we determine the dissociation channels and we compute the kinetic energy release and angular momentum distribution of the final arrangements. Among the eight potential energy surfaces investigated here, only the lowest triplet and the three lowest singlet can lead to the formation of bound residual fragment. The dissociation of HOD(2+) presents a strong preference for OH rather than OD bond breakage. It is characterized by the isotopic ratio, defined as the number of OD(+) over the number of OH(+) residual fragments. This ratio depends strongly on the shape of each potential energy surface and on the initial conditions.",

However, this underlying intermolecular structure is constantly in motion, exhibiting large fluctuations and reorganizations on time scales from femtoseconds to picoseconds. These motions allow water to play a key role in a number of chemical and biological processes. By exploiting the fact that the OH stretching frequency of dilute HOD in liquid D(2)O is highly dependent upon the configuration of the neighbor nearest to the proton, researchers have been able to track water's time-dependent structure using two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, which tags molecules at an initial frequency and then watches as that frequency evolves with respect to time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulation techniques allow for the calculation of 2D IR spectra, providing an atomistic interpretation tool of 2D IR spectra in terms of the underlying dynamics of the liquid. In this Account, we review recent ultrafast 2D IR studies at MIT that provide new information on the mechanism of hydrogen-bond rearrangements in liquid water. The 2D IR spectra of the OH stretching vibration of HOD in D(2)O appear highly asymmetric. In the frequency range indicative of hydrogen-bonded molecules (&lt;3300 cm(-1)), the 2D spectra remain fairly compact. By contrast, in the frequency range in which molecules having weak or broken hydrogen bonds absorb (&gt;3500 cm(-1)), the 2D spectra broaden over a time scale of approximately 60 fs, consistent with librations (hindered rotations) of water molecules. This broadening indicates that molecules forming weak or broken hydrogen bonds are unstable and reorient rapidly to return to a hydrogen-bonded configuration. These conclusions are supported by the results of molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest that water molecules undergo a large-angle reorientation during the course of hydrogen-bond exchange. The transition state for hydrogen-bond rearrangements is found to resemble a bifurcated hydrogen bond. Roughly half of the hydrogen-bond exchange events in the simulation are found to involve the insertion of a water molecule across a hydrogen bond, suggesting that hydrogen-bond exchange in water involves the correlated motion of water molecules as far away as the second solvation shell. The combination of ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy with simulation-based modeling is leading to self-consistent descriptions of the underlying dynamics in liquid water. Moreover, these results also demonstrate a more general, unique characteristic of the spectroscopy: if a spectral signature of the transition state exists, then 2D IR can effectively serve as a transition-state spectroscopy.",

Zero-pressure-limit dissociation rate constants for loss of a single water molecule from the hydrated divalent metal ions, M(2+)(H(2)O)(n) (M = Mg, Ca, and Sr for n = 5-7, and M = Ba for n = 4-7), are measured as a function of temperature using blackbody infrared radiative dissociation. From these values, zero-pressure-limit Arrhenius parameters are obtained. By modeling the dissociation kinetics using a master equation formalism, threshold dissociation energies (E(o)) are determined. These reactions should have a negligible reverse activation barrier; therefore, E(o) values should be approximately equal to the binding energy or hydration enthalpy at 0 K. For the hepta- and hexahydrated ions at low temperature, binding energies follow the trend expected on the basis of ionic radii: Mg &gt; Ca &gt; Sr &gt; Ba. For the hexahydrated ions at high temperature, binding energies follow the order Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Sr &gt; Ba. The same order is observed for the pentahydrated ions. Collisional dissociation experiments on the tetrahydrated species result in relative dissociation rates that directly correlate with the size of the metals. These results indicate the presence of two isomers for hexahydrated magnesium ions: a low-temperature isomer in which the six water molecules are located in the first solvation shell, and a high-temperature isomer with the most likely structure corresponding to four water molecules in the inner shell and two water molecules in the second shell. These results also indicate that the pentahydrated magnesium ions have a structure with four water molecules in the first solvation shell and one in the outer shell. The dissociation kinetics for the hexa- and pentahydrated clusters of Ca(2+), Sr(2+), and Ba(2+) are consistent with structures in which all the water molecules are located in the first solvation shell.",

As we have shown, reaction and transition rates can at lowest order be treated as dependent only on some length scale (proportional to a 0 ) and some energy scale (atomic, rotational, or vibrational). Since H 2 has no dipole moment (d = 0), H 2 state transitions are quadrupolar, with the vibrational and rotational Einstein coefficients derived above. We neglect higher moments, which are less important for scattering rates and cooling processes. Lastly, several reaction rates will require the ground state polarizability, a tensor mediating the external electric field and the induced electric dipole moment, p ij \u221d a 3 0 \u221d 1/(m 3 \u03b1 3 ). This is straightforward to show for the H atom (see e.g. Sakurai & Napolitano (2017) for a discussion using perturbation theory), but is more complicated for the H 2 molecule (Ko\u0142os & Wolniewicz 1967).

Methyl radicals were generated by laser flash photolysis of azomethane or acetone. Methylperoxy radicals were monitored by UV absorption at 240 nm. The falloff curves of the rate constants are represented by the simplified expression k/k(infinity) approximately [x/(1 + x)]F(cent)(1/{1+[(log)(x)/)(N)(]2}) with x = k(0)/k(infinity) F(cent) approximately 0.33, and N approximately 1.47, where k(0) and k(infinity) denote the limiting low and high-pressure rate constants, respectively. At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed. This effect is attributed to a contribution from the radical complex mechanism as was also observed in other recombination reactions of larger radicals. Equal limiting low-pressure rate constants k(0) = [M]7 x 10(-31)(T/300 K)(-3.0) cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1) were fitted for M = Ar and N(2) whereas limiting high-pressure rate constants k(infinity) = 2.2 x 10(-12)(T/300 K)(0.9) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) were approached. These values are discussed in terms of unimolecular rate theory. It is concluded that a theoretical interpretation of the derived rate constants has to be postponed until better information of the potential energy surface is available. Preliminary theoretical evaluation suggests that there is an \"anisotropy bottleneck\" in the otherwise barrierless interaction potential between CH(3) and O(2).",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior\n- Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation\n- Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior\n- Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and the van der Waals equation\n\nThus far, the ideal gas law, $P V=n R T$, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from\nreaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.\n\nOne way in which the accuracy of $P V=n R T$ can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ ) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the compressibility factor ( $\\mathbf{Z}$ ) with:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Z}=\\frac{\\text { molar volume of gas at same } T \\text { and } P}{\\text { molar volume of ideal gas at same } T \\text { and } P}=\\left(\\frac{P V_{m}}{R T}\\right)_{\\text {measured }}\n$$\n\nIdeal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1 , and any deviation from 1 is an indication of non-ideal behavior. Figure 8.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.35 A graph of the compressibility factor $(Z)$ vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.\n\nAs is apparent from Figure 8.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures.

To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.\n\nParticles of a hypothetical ideal gas have no significant volume and do not attract or repel each other. In general, real gases approximate this behavior at relatively low pressures and high temperatures. However, at high pressures, the molecules of a gas are crowded closer together, and the amount of empty space between the molecules is reduced. At these higher pressures, the volume of the gas molecules themselves becomes appreciable relative to the total volume occupied by the gas. The gas therefore becomes less compressible at these high pressures, and although its volume continues to decrease with increasing pressure, this decrease is not proportional as predicted by Boyle's law.\n\nAt relatively low pressures, gas molecules have practically no attraction for one another because they are (on average) so far apart, and they behave almost like particles of an ideal gas. At higher pressures, however, the force of attraction is also no longer insignificant. This force pulls the molecules a little closer together, slightly decreasing the pressure (if the volume is constant) or decreasing the volume (at constant pressure) (Figure 8.36). This change is more pronounced at low temperatures because the molecules have lower KE relative to the attractive forces, and so they are less effective in overcoming these attractions after colliding with one another.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.36 (a) Attractions between gas molecules serve to decrease the gas volume at constant pressure compared to an ideal gas whose molecules experience no attractive forces. (b) These attractive forces will decrease the force of collisions between the molecules and container walls, therefore reducing the pressure exerted at constant volume compared to an ideal gas.\n\nThere are several different equations that better approximate gas behavior than does the ideal gas law.

Whereas a standard Arrhenius behavior was found at T &gt; 200 K, indicating the presence of an activation barrier, a dramatic increase in the rate coefficient by a factor of 130 was observed when the temperature was decreased from 168 to 123 K.

The work was complemented by ab initio transition state theory based master equation calculations using reaction pathways investigated with highly accurate thermochemical protocols. The role of collisional stabilization of a CNCH3CN van der Waals complex and of tunneling induced H atom abstractions were also considered. The experimental pressure dependence at 52 and 132 K is well reproduced by the theoretical calculations provided that an anharmonic state density is considered for the van der Waals complex CH3CNCN and its Lennard-Jones radius is adjusted. Furthermore, these calculations indicate that the experimental observations correspond to the fall-off regime and that tunneling remains small in the low-pressure regime.

Attempts were made to calculate values of a and b in van der .Waals' equation from these data ; it was found, however, to be impossible, the equation not representing the facts with sufficient accuracy. Taking the simple equation pv = RT R is found to vary about 2 per cent, between -20\u00b0 and 100\u00b0. Compressibility of Ammonia.-By comparing the density at half an atmosphere with that at one atmosphere, the compressibility of ammonia may be determined. The globe, was tilled with ammonia in the usual way, then connected with a pressure-gauge and about half the ammonia pumped out. Next the ammonia was allowed to blow off until equilibrium had been attained, when the pressure was immediately read. The readings were made on a mirror scale, the barometer standing in the same trough being read at the same time (see fig. II). Owing to the difficulty of reading the pressure and maintaining its constancy, no great accuracy was attained; the probable error is about 0 2 mm. As before stated, we cannot claim any great accuracy for this result, and we prefer to make use of Lord Rayleigh's number in proceeding to calculate the molecular weight of ammonia, the method and apparatus used by him being specially adapted to the purpose.* Lord Rayleigh found B = 1*00632 at 9\u00b0*7, which, corrected in the way indicated by him, becomes 1*00706 at 0\u00b0.\n\nThis gives a = -0*01413, and the correction factor The density calculated from Rayleigh's value for the compressibility (B = T00706) is 0*38272. The partial pressure of the ammonia in the above table is obtained by subtracting the partial pressure of the air (calculated from its weight) from the total pressure. I t will be seen that the density is nearly one part in 1000 higher than that calculated from the compressibility, and this represents the deviation from Dalton's law of a mixture of approximately equal volumes of ammonia and air.",

According to the revised Fenimore mechanism, which is initiated by the NCN forming reaction CH + N(2)\u2192 NCN + H, this reaction plays a key role for prompt NO(x) formation in flames. NCN radicals and O atoms have been quantitatively generated by the pyrolysis of NCN(3) and N(2)O, respectively. NCN concentration-time profiles have been monitored behind shock waves using narrow-bandwidth laser absorption at a wavelength of \u03bb = 329.1302 nm. Whereas no pressure dependence was discernible at pressures between 709 mbar &lt; p &lt; 1861 mbar, a barely significant temperature dependence corresponding to an activation energy of 5.8 \u00b1 6.0 kJ mol(-1) was found. Overall, at temperatures of 1826 K &lt; T &lt; 2783 K, the rate constant can be expressed as k(NCN + O) = 9.6 \u00d7 10(13)\u00d7 exp(-5.8 kJ mol(-1)/RT) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) (\u00b140%). As a requirement for accurate high temperature rate constant measurements, a consistent NCN background mechanism has been derived from pyrolysis experiments of pure NCN(3)/Ar gas mixtures, beforehand. Presumably, the bimolecular secondary reaction NCN + NCN yields CN radicals hence triggering a chain reaction cycle that efficiently removes NCN. A temperature independent value of k(NCN + NCN) = (3.7 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10(12) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) has been determined from measurements at pressures ranging from 143 mbar to 1884 mbar and temperatures ranging from 966 K to 1900 K.

If so, we would observe only a single NMR absorption signal in the ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ spectrum of a molecule, a situation that would be of little use. In fact, the absorption frequency is not the same for all ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ or all ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ nuclei.\n\nAll nuclei in molecules are surrounded by electrons. When an external magnetic field is applied to a molecule, the electrons moving around nuclei set up tiny local magnetic fields of their own. These local magnetic fields act in opposition to the applied field so that the effective field actually felt by the nucleus is a bit weaker than the applied field.\n\n$$\nB_{\\text {effective }}=B_{\\text {applied }}=B_{\\text {local }}\n$$\n\nIn describing this effect of local fields, we say that nuclei experience shielding from the full effect of the applied field by the surrounding electrons. Because each chemically distinct nucleus in a molecule is in a slightly different electronic environment, each nucleus is shielded to a slightly different extent and the effective magnetic field felt by each is slightly different. These tiny differences in the effective magnetic fields experienced by different nuclei can be detected, and we thus see a distinct NMR signal for each chemically distinct ${ }^{13} \\mathrm{C}$ or ${ }^{1} \\mathrm{H}$ nucleus in a molecule. As a result, an NMR spectrum effectively maps the carbon-hydrogen framework of an organic molecule. With practice, it's possible to read this map and derive structural information.",

To resolve these conflicts, a full-dimensional potential-energy surface for the dissociation of CH(3)CHO into HCO and CH(3) fragments over the barrier on the T(1) surface is developed based on RO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ(DZ) ab initio calculations. 20,000 classical trajectories are calculated on this surface at each of five initial excess energies, spanning the excitation energies used in previous experimental studies, and translational, vibrational, and rotational distributions of the radical products are determined. For excess energies near the dissociation threshold, both the HCO and CH(3) products are vibrationally cold; there is a small amount of HCO rotational excitation and little CH(3) rotational excitation, and the reaction energy is partitioned dominantly (&gt;90% at threshold) into relative translational motion. Close to threshold the HCO and CH(3) rotational distributions are symmetrically shaped, resembling a Gaussian function, in agreement with observed experimental HCO rotational distributions. As the excess energy increases the calculated HCO and CH(3) rotational distributions are observed to change from a Gaussian shape at threshold to one more resembling a Boltzmann distribution, a behavior also seen by various experimental groups. Thus the distribution of energy in these rotational degrees of freedom is observed to change from nonstatistical to apparently statistical, as excess energy increases. As the energy above threshold increases all the internal and external degrees of freedom are observed to gain population at a similar rate, broadly consistent with equipartitioning of the available energy at the transition state. These observations generally support the practice of separating the reaction dynamics into two reservoirs: an impulsive reservoir, fed by the exit channel dynamics, and a statistical reservoir, supported by the random distribution of excess energy above the barrier. The HCO rotation, however, is favored by approximately a factor of 3 over the statistical prediction. Thus, at sufficiently high excess energies, although the HCO rotational distribution may be considered statistical, the partitioning of energy into HCO rotation is not.",

The presented protocol also incorporates a scaling procedure to take into account the effect of multiplicity of a CH(2) or CH(3) moiety. Experimental CHHC buildup curves are presented for l-tyrosine.HCl samples where either all or only one in 10 molecules are U-(13)C labeled. Good agreement between experiment and 11-spin SPINEVOLUTION simulation (including only isotropic (1)H chemical shifts) is demonstrated for the initial buildup (t(mix)&lt;100micros) of CHHC peak intensity corresponding to an intramolecular close (2.5A) H-H proximity. Differences in the initial CHHC buildup are observed between the one in 10 dilute and 100% samples for cases where there is a close intermolecular H-H proximity in addition to a close intramolecular H-H proximity. For the dilute sample, CHHC cross-peak intensities tended to significantly lower values for long mixing times (500micros) as compared to the 100% sample. This difference is explained as being due to the dependence of the limiting total magnetization on the ratio N(obs)/N(tot) between the number of protons that are directly attached to a (13)C nucleus and hence contribute significantly to the observed (13)C CHHC NMR signal, and the total number of (1)H spins into the system. (1)H-(1)H magnetization exchange curves extracted from CHHC spectra for the 100% l-tyrosine.HCl sample exhibit a clear sensitivity to the root sum squared dipolar coupling, with fast buildup being observed for the shortest intramolecular distances (2.5A) and slower, yet observable buildup for the longer intermolecular distances (up to 5A).",

The differences between observed and calculated shift values for the molecule in solution are most readily explained by slight movement of the heme and certain changes in diamagnetic shift due to small rearrangements of a few residues and some considerable changes in a few hydrogen bonds. It is also known that small differences exist between the structures of the two oxidation states in crystals but the hydrogen-bond changes are not so easily observed there. Structural changes from nuclear magnetic resonance data are in reasonable agreement with those deduced from crystallography, but additional information is clearly available concerning changes in hydrogen bonding.",

This C3 proton signal appears as a doublet centered at $7.49 \\delta$. Because it has one neighbor proton at C 2 , its signal is split into a doublet, with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\n- The C2 vinylic proton signal (blue) appears at $6.73 \\delta$ and shows an interesting, four-line absorption pattern. It is coupled to the two nonequivalent protons at C 1 and C 3 with two different coupling constants: $J_{1-2}=6$ Hz and $J_{2-3}=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$.\n\nA good way to understand the effect of multiple coupling, such as that occurring for the C2 proton of trans-cinnamaldehyde, is to draw a tree diagram, like that in FIGURE 13.15. The diagram shows the individual effect of each coupling constant on the overall pattern. Coupling with the C3 proton splits the signal of the C2 proton in trans-cinnamaldehyde into a doublet with $J=12 \\mathrm{~Hz}$. Further coupling with the aldehyde proton then splits each peak of the doublet into new doublets with $J=6 \\mathrm{~Hz}$, and we therefore observe a four-line spectrum for the C 2 proton.\n\n\n$6.73 \\delta$",

In this prospective study, 43 consecutive patients with large (not less than 3 cm in diameter) hepatic tumors and eight normal volunteer were included. MRS of the lesions in addition to uninvolved liver parenchyma was carried out using a whole-body 3.0-T scanner. Among the patients with proven HCC, eight lesions were evaluated before and two to five days after TACE. The choline-to-lipid (cho/lipid) ratio was measured by dividing the peak area of choline at 3.2 ppm by the peak area of lipid at 1.3 ppm. The sensitivity and specificity profiles of MRS in the diagnosis of malignant hepatic tumors were determined by plotting empirical receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The mean cho/lipid ratios in different groups before and after TACE were also measured. The technical success rate for MRS was 90% (53/59). The ROC curve showed proton MRS has moderate discriminating ability in diagnosing malignant hepatic tumors, although the sensitivity was less than 50% while 1-specificity was less than 20%. The area under the curve was 0.71 (P &lt; 0.05). The mean +/- 1 standard error (SE) of cho/lipid ratios for uninvolved liver (N = 8), benign tumor (N = 8), and malignant tumor (N = 21; 19 HCC, one angiosarcoma, and one lymphoma) were 0.06 +/- 0.02, 0.02 +/- 0.02, and 0.17 +/- 0.05, respectively. A significantly statistical difference (ANOVA planned contrast test, P = 0.01 and Games-Howell procedure, P = 0.03) was achieved in the mean cho/lipid ratio between malignant and benign tumors. The mean cho/lipid ratios were significantly decreased from 0.23 +/- 0.11 before TACE to 0.01 +/- 0.00 after the treatment (t = 2.01, P &lt; 0.05, one-tail paired t-test; z = -2.37, P &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test). In vivo proton MRS is technically feasible for the evaluation of focal hepatic lesions.

The pulsed field gradient spin-echo (PGSE) (1)H and (2)H NMR were used, respectively, at 600 and 92 MHz. At 30 degrees C, the hydrodynamic radius (R) obtained at 20 mM from the D value and solvent viscosity is 5.09, 7.07, and 6.17 A, respectively, in 1-octanol, chloroform, and cyclohexane when the impurity water is negligible. The R value in 1-octanol is the smallest and comparable with the average length of the molecular axes for the cholesterol molecule. In 1-octanol, R is invariant against the concentration variation, whereas in chloroform, R is larger and increases almost linearly with cholesterol concentration. At the highest concentration, 700 mM, the R in chloroform is 13.5 and 16.7 A, respectively, when the impurity water is at negligible and saturated concentrations. The R value larger than that in hydrogen-bonding 1-octanol indicates that cholesterol forms an aggregate through hydrogen bonding. The aggregate structure is confirmed by comparing NOESY spectra in chloroform and 1-octanol. The NOESY analysis reveals the presence of one extra cross peak (C4-C19) in chloroform compared to 1-octanol. Because the carbon atoms related to the cross peak are close to the hydroxyl group (C3-OH), cholesterol molecules are considered to be not piled but are found to be OH-centered in the aggregate. This is supported also by larger rotational hydrodynamic radii measured on cholesterol deuterated at positions C2, C3, C4, and C6. This shows that the aggregate formation is driven by the hydrogen-bonding between cholesterol molecules.",

Binding of kanamycins to APH occurs with a larger negative DeltaH in H2O relative to D2O (DeltaDeltaH(H2O-D2O) &lt; 0), while the reverse is true for neomycins. Unusually large negative DeltaCp values were observed for binding of aminoglycosides to APH. DeltaCp for the APH-neomycin complex was -1.6 kcal x mol(-1) x deg(-1). A break at 30 degrees C was observed in the APH-kanamycin complex yielding DeltaCp values of -0.7 kcal x mol(-1) x deg(-1) and -3.8 kcal x mol(-1) x deg(-1) below and above 30 degrees C, respectively. Neither the change in accessible surface area (DeltaASA) nor contributions from heats of ionization were sufficient to explain the large negative DeltaCp values. Most significantly, 15N-1H HSQC experiments showed that temperature-dependent shifts of the backbone amide protons of Leu 88, Ser 91, Cys 98, and Leu143 revealed a break at 30 degrees C only in the APH-kanamycin complex in spectra collected between 21 degrees C and 38 degrees C. These amino acids represent solvent reorganization sites that experience a change in solvent structure in their immediate environment as structurally different ligands bind to the enzyme. These residues were away from the substrate binding site and distributed in three hydrophobic patches in APH. Overall, our results show that a large number of factors affect DeltaCp and binding of structurally different ligand groups cause different solvent structure in the active site as well as differentially affecting specific sites away from the ligand binding site.",

When an aromatic ring is oriented perpendicular to a strong magnetic field, the electrons circulate around the ring, producing a small local magnetic field. This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized $\\pi$ electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.\nNote that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring. If a ring were large enough to have both \"inside\" and \"outside\" protons, the protons on the outside would be deshielded and absorb\nat a field lower than normal but those on the inside would be shielded and absorb at a field higher than normal.

These effects were analysed using the CHARGE model, which incorporates the electric field, magnetic anisotropy and steric effects of the functional group for long-range protons together with functions for the calculation of the two- and three-bond effects. The effect of the ester electric field was given by considering the partial atomic charges on the three atoms of the ester group. The anisotropy of the carbonyl group was reproduced with an asymmetric magnetic anisotropy acting at the midpoint of the carbonyl bond with values of Deltachi(parl) and Deltachi(perp) of 10.1 x 10(-30) and -17.1 x 10(-30) cm3 molecule(-1).

For phenol, 2- and 4-cyanophenol and 2-nitrophenol the OH chemical shifts were measured as a function of concentration in CDCl(3). The plots were all linear with concentration, the gradients varying from 0.940 (phenol) to 7.85 (4-cyanophenol) ppm/M because of competing inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Ab initio calculations of a model acetone/phenol system showed that the OH shielding was linear with the H...O=C distance (R) for R &lt; 2.1 A with a shielding coefficient of - 7.8 ppm/A and proportional to cos(2)phi where phi is the H...O=C--C dihedral angle.

The dependence of the OH chemical shift on the pi density on the oxygen atom was determined as ca 40 ppm/pi electron. This factor is similar to that for NH but four times the value for sp(2) hybridized carbon atoms.

The CHARGE calculations were more accurate than other calculations both when all the shifts were considered and also when the OH shifts were excluded. The calculations from the ACD and GIAO approaches were reasonable when the OH shifts were excluded but not as good when all the shifts were considered.

Experimental evidence suggests increasing concentrations of tCho-compounds during cellular proliferation. The present study was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that in vivo measurements of tCho-concentrations using (1)H MRS allow assessment of the proliferative activity of neuroepithelial brain tumors presurgically. Single-voxel (1)H MRS (PRESS, TR 1500 ms, TE 135 ms) was performed in 101 patients with neuroepithelial brain tumors prior to surgery and 19 healthy volunteers. Histological diagnoses were confirmed postsurgically according to the WHO classification. Measured tCho-compound signal intensities were corrected for coil loading, numbers of acquisitions and voxel size, and tCho concentrations calculated as institutional arbitrary units. They were matched with the mean immunohistochemical marker of cell proliferation, the Ki-67 (MIB.1) labeling index, using correlation analysis according to Spearman. Compared with low-grade tumors (i.e. WHO grade I/II) and normal white brain matter, high-grade tumors (i.e. WHO grade III/IV) revealed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) elevated labeling indices paralleled by increasingly elevated tCho-concentrations. In contrast tCho-concentrations in low-grade tumor did not differ significantly from physiological values. A highly significant positive correlation (p &lt; 0.0001, r(2) = 0.81) was found between the tCho-concentration and the labeling index. It was concluded that the determination of tCho-concentrations using in vivo (1)H MRS could provide a novel and noninvasive assessment of the proliferative activity of neuroepithelial brain tumors, pointing at (1)H MRS as a useful method for differentiating proliferating from non-proliferating tissues.

Two isomers of 56.2% combined abundance have differentiated alpha (near) and beta (remote) (1)H NMR pyrazine resonances at 9.09 ppm (alpha or H2, H6 pair) and 8.33 ppm (beta or H3, H5 pair). The other isomer of ca. 24% abundance exhibits only a singlet at 8.76 ppm, indicative of fluxional pyrazine movement from N-1 to N-4. This is believed to be the cis-polar isomer. Within 24 h the differentiated isomers convert to the fluxional isomer, which remains fluxional in 50% D(2)O/50% CD(3)OD down to 237 K. The fluxional isomer has all equivalent (13)C NMR resonances at 152.44 ppm, 5.18 ppm downfield of free pyrazine. Comparison with the bridged binuclear ion {[Ru(hedta)](2)(pz)}(2)(-) revealed fortuitously similar shifts; the (1)H NMR spectrum shows a singlet at 8.76 ppm, and the (13)C NMR spectrum, a singlet at 152.40 ppm. These species have different electrochemical signatures, however, with the 1:1 fluxional complex having a Ru(II/III) wave at 0.20 V that shifts to 0.35 V upon protonation of the N-4 position, whereas the binuclear complex has two waves at 0.18 and 0.33 V which are independent of pH. (1)H NMR indicates stereochemically rigid coordination of 2-methylpyrazine (2-CH(3)pz) at N-4 with the 2-CH(3) position remote in the major species (65.5%) and at N-2 with the 2-CH(3) site adjacent (34.4%) in the lesser isomer. The proton resonances are as follows. Remote isomer (N-4): H2, 8.22 ppm; H3, 8.97 ppm; H5, 8.88 ppm; CH(3), 2.53 ppm. Adjacent (N-1) isomer: H2, 8.73 ppm; H3, 8.42 ppm, H5, 8.50 ppm; CH(3), 2.45 ppm. A slow conversion of the strained adjacent isomer to the remote isomer is observed. Remote and adjacent isomers were also prepared for [(NH(3))(5)Ru(2-CH(3)pz)](2+) in 87.7% and 12.3% yield. Protonation of [Ru(hedta)(pz)](-) yields nonfluxional complexes: a major species (63%) bound eta(2)(1,2) with four complicated resonance patterns at 8.72, 8.57, 8.00, and 7.91 ppm, each signal having across-the-ring couplings which require couplings to at least two different ring protons and a minor N-1-coordinated N-4 protonated species (16%) with alpha and beta proton pairs resonating at 8.81 and 8.25 ppm. An eta(2)(2,3) isomer is also detectable (20%) which has four types of (1)H resonances at 9.51, 9.01, 8.85, and 8.15 ppm. The weakened sigma bonding from pzH(+) and enhanced pi-acceptor capacity power of pzH(+) combine to induce a switch in coordination to either eta(2)(1,2) or eta(2)(2,3).",

Their affinity towards the proton is scrutinized both in the gas phase and in solution in acetonitrile. The protonation at the most basic center (the imine nitrogen) yields asymmetric and relatively strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds (IHB). It is found that the angular strain effect and steric repulsion practically vanish in TMGN which implies that its high absolute proton affinity (APA) has its origin in the inherent basicity of the guanidine fragment and a relatively strong IHB in [TMGN]H(+). The nonbonded repulsions in TMGF are higher than in TMGN, which in conjunction with a slightly stronger IHB in the corresponding conjugate acid makes it more basic: APA(TMGF)&gt;APA(TMGN). An interesting new phenomenon is observed in both TMGN and TMGF: the proton triggers the resonance stabilization not only in the directly bonded guanidine moiety, but also in the other guanidine fragment which is more distant from the proton, albeit in a less pronounced manner. The latter feature is termed a partial protonation. This supports the hydrogen bonding and contributes to the IHB stabilization. Convincing evidence is presented that the solvent effect in acetonitrile is determined by two antagonistic factors: 1) the intrinsic (gas phase) proton affinity and 2) the size effect which is given by the ratio between the positive charge in molecular cation (conjugate acid) and the magnitude of the molecular surface. The resulting pK(a) values are given by an interplay of these factors.",

A stepwise hydration of TA is accompanied with certain changes in geometrical parameters (bond lengths and angles) and redistribution of partial electric charges in TA. An aqueous cluster of 45 water molecules can be considered as an appropriate model for a complete aqueous shell around TA, although most of the structural and electronic characteristics of TA already converge at about 10 water molecules. Water surroundings induce an increase in electron spin density on the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide fragment due to stabilization of the polar resonance structure &gt; N(+*)-O(-) at the expense of less polar structure &gt; N-O*. The water-induced rise of the isotropic splitting constant a(iso), calculated from the contact term of the hyperfine interaction, comprises Deltaa(iso)(rho(N2)) = 2.2-2.5 G, which is typical of experimental value for TA. There are two contributions to the solvent effect on the a(iso)(rho(N2)) value: the redistribution of spin density in the nitroxide fragment (polarity effect) and water-induced distortions of TA geometry. Microscopic variations in a hydrogen-bonded water network cause noticeable fluctuations of the splitting constant a(iso)(rho(N2)). Calculations of the atomic spin density (sigma(N2)) allowed us to compute the splitting constant from the relationship a(iso)(sigma(N2)) = Qsigma(N2), where Q = 36.2 G. A practical advantage of using this relationship is that it gives 'smoothed' values of the splitting constant, which are sensitive to the environment polarity but remain tolerant to microscopic fluctuations of the hydrogen-bonded water network around a spin-label molecule.",

(c) The numbers obtained scatter strongly: the estimated barrier height may be stated to be 11eV. (d) The apparent barrier height appears to depend on the polarity of the bias potential. It should be kept in mind that even in vacuum STM the barrier to tunneling is expected to be lower than the workfunctions of the metals involved because of image effects associated with the fast electronic response of the electrodes. 91 Nevertheless, the reduction of barrier height in the aqueous phase seems to be considerably larger. Taking the vacuum barrier as input in our discussion lets consider the possible role of the solvent. These can arise from the following factors: (1) The position, on the energy scale, of the \"conduction band\" of the pure solvent. By \"conduction band\" we mean extended electronic states of an excess electron in the neutral solvent configuration. (2) The effect of the solvent on the electrode workfunction. (3) The hard cores of the atomic constituents, in the present case the water oxygens, which make a substantial part of the physical space between the electrodes inaccessible to the electron. (4) The possibility that the tunneling is assisted by resonance states supported by the solvent. Such resonances can be associated with available molecular orbitals -this does not appear to be the case in water-or with particular transient structures in the solvent configurations as discussed above. Factors (2)-(4) are usually disregarded in theories of electron transfer, while a common practice is to account for the first factor by setting the potential barrier height at a value, below the vacuum level, determined by the contribution of the solvent electronic polarizability. This value can be estimated as the Born energy of a point charge in a cavity of intermolecular dimensions, say a radius of a~5au, in a continuum with the proper dielectric constant, here the optical dielectric constant of water, \u03b5 \u221e =1.88.

The latter results are obtained with a spatial grid technique using the electron-Ar pseudo-potential of Space et al. 314 The oscillations shown in Fig. 20a are interference patterns associated with the finite width of the layers. The full line in Fig. 20b also shows such oscillations, but in addition, a prominent dip above 4eV corresponds to a conduction band gap of this thin ordered layer. The dashed line in Fig 20b shows similar transmission results for disordered layers, obtained from the crystalline layer by a numerical thermal annealing at 400K next to an adsorbing wall using molecular dynamics propagation.

Furthermore, if other loss channels exist, so carriers may be redirected or absorbed with a rate # B once they populate the bridge, the bridge length dependence again becomes exponential and may be written\n( ) N diff up e N k k g \u03b1 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + 1 1 1\n, where $ is related to this loss rate. 49,[278][279][280][281] Table 1 119 summarizes these results for the Markovian limit of the thermal relaxation process Table 1 Bridge length dependence of the transmission rate 119\n\n\nPhysical Process",

A multi-step incoherent hopping transport mechanism rationalizes the power-law length dependence (i.e., the carrier diffuses on the bridge). In this regime, thermal activation arises because of the activation free energy required to inject carriers onto the bridge and the activation free energy for site-to-site hopping [S7,S8], or in electrochemical junctions by reorganization energy of the redox couple [S11,S12]. McCreery et al. [S1,S2] and Porath et al. [S13] reported voltage dependences for the current in molecular junctions, which are attributed to lowering of the barrier and screening of the applied field by the molecules. This explanation assumes that the electronic states above the barrier are all extended. In most organic molecules, however, the states directly above the barrier are localized while extended states can only be found at much higher energies. Our theory, which accounts for the change in nature of the electronic states from localized to quasi-extended, also includes the change in the barrier height.\n\n\nOutline of the numerical calculation\n\nThe results given in the main text for the electron transmission probability and current through the molecules were obtained using two different numerical methods: (i) For the analysis of the singleband Hamiltonian (Eq. 1) we followed the numerical method of Ref. S14, which is based on the Poincar\u00e9 map representation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and is commonly known as the transfer matrix method. (ii) The transmission probability through DNA molecules modeled by the multiband Hamiltonian in Eq. 5 was obtained by numerical computation of the Green's function. Below, we outline both methods.\n\nCalculation of the transmission probability for the single-band model:\n\nThe aim of the numerical derivation is to find transmission probability for each realization of the disorder potential dis ( ), and then average it over a large number of realizations. In practice, we average the logarithm of the transmission probability, which is more stable and leads to faster convergence [S15].",

The electron transport is studied by comparing the depth dose distributions in a water phantom subdivided into thin layers using incident energies (0.05, 0.1, 1, and 10 MeV) for the broad parallel electron beams. The IC response simulations are studied in water phantom in three dosimetric gas materials (air, argon, and methane based tissue equivalent gas) for photon beams ((60)Co source, 6 MV linear medical accelerator, and mono-energetic 2 MeV photon source).

The electron substep length (ESTEP parameter) dependency in mcnp5 is investigated as well. For the electron beam studies, large discrepancies (&gt;3%) are observed between the MCNP5 dose distributions and the reference codes at 1 MeV and lower energies. The discrepancy is especially notable for 0.1 and 0.05 MeV electron beams. The boundary crossing artifacts, which are well known for the mcnp5(ITS), are observed for the mcnp5(new) only at 0.1 and 0.05 MeV beam energies. If the excessive boundary crossing is eliminated by using single scoring cells, the mcnp5(ITS) provides dose distributions that agree better with the reference codes than mcnp5(new). The mcnp5 dose estimates for the gas cavity agree within 1% with the reference codes, if the mcnp5(ITS) is applied or electron substep length is set adequately for the gas in the cavity using the mcnp5(new). The mcnp5(new) results are found highly dependent on the chosen electron substep length and might lead up to 15% underestimation of the absorbed dose.

Still, as shown in Ref.101 , for a proper choice of clock the traversal time provides a useful measure for the adiabaticity or non-adiabaticity of the interaction of the tunneling particle with barrier degrees of freedom.

(73) and (74) yield \u03c4 \u2245 0.2fs and \u03c4 \u2245 2fs, respectively, both considerably shorter than the vibrational period of molecular vibrations.

For the majority of genes expressed in eukaryotic cells, only single/few transcript copies are generated, which reinforces the stochastic nature of NPC localization. In this paper, I analyse the NPC localization by freely diffusing single mRNPs and discuss the implications for the temporal progression of gene expression and consecutive processes associated with the gene products. To this end, a walk-and-capture model is considered, assuming a spherical nuclear compartment with a partially absorbing boundary. Perfect absorption and perfect reflection mark the extreme outcomes. For this model, the closed-form analytic solution of the first-passage time probability density function (FPT p.d.f.), the mean passage time and variance have been obtained. The FPT p.d.f. enables to calculate the probability that single mRNPs localize the nuclear boundary and dock to NPCs within certain time windows. For freely moving mRNP complexes in osteosarcoma cell nuclei, a mean apparent diffusion coefficient (D) of 0.04 microm2 s(-1) (range 0.01-0.09 microm2 s(-1)) has been reported. Assuming a nuclear radius of 8 microm and D=0.04 microm2 s(-1), the position-averaged minimum mean passage time &lt;tau(r0)&gt;min for the considered model is 1.8 min, which presupposes perfect absorption of the mRNP complex at the first encounter with the nuclear boundary. In this case, the probability of capture in the time interval (0, &lt;tau(r0)&gt;min) is 0.67. In smaller sized yeast cell nuclei with a radius of 0.8 mum and D=0.04 microm2 s(-1), single diffusing mRNPs would localize an NPC within tens of seconds, rather than minutes.",

It is well known that proteins smaller than 50 kDa can diffuse though NPCs, whereas proteins larger than 60 kDa rarely enter by passive diffusion. Little, however, is known about how this size cutoff develops as the NE reassembles and the nucleus expands. In 1987, a well-known study identified an efficient mechanism by which large diffusing proteins (&gt; 60 kDa) were excluded from the reassembling nucleus after mitosis. Since then, it has been generally accepted that after mitosis, newly formed nuclei completely exclude all proteins except those that are initially bound to the mitotic chromosomes and those that are selectively imported through NPCs. Here, the tetrameric complex of the photoconvertible fluorescent protein KikGR ( approximately 103 kDa) was optically highlighted in the cytoplasm and followed to examine its entry into nuclei. Remarkably, highlighted complexes efficiently entered newly assembled nuclei during an approximately 20-min period after the completion of cytokinesis. Because KikGR contains no known nuclear-localization or chromosome-binding sequences, our results indicate the diffusion barrier is less restrictive during nuclear reassembly.",

The maximum value of n(s) studied was 450, which covers most situations met in practice. Calculations were performed for linear chains, half-circles, circles (cyclic molecules) and S-shaped aggregates. It was shown that our results agreed with previous theoretical data obtained for linear chains and cyclic aggregates, for n(s)&lt;100. For larger n(s), studied exclusively in our work, interpolating analytical expressions were formulated for the hydrodynamic radii R(H). These expressions, involving logarithmic function of the aspect ratio parameter (length to width ratio of the macromolecules), are the main finding of our work. Using these expressions, the ratio of the hydrodynamic radius of cyclic-to-linear aggregate q(f) was calculated, which is a parameter of vital significance. It was determined that q(f) attained values close to 0.95 for n(s) approximately 450. This suggests that the previous analytical results derived by Tchen [19], in the slender body limit, who predicted that q(f)--&gt;12/11=1.09, are not applicable for n(s)&lt;450. Using the R(H) values, the average translation diffusion coefficients and the sedimentation coefficients for these aggregate shapes were calculated. It was shown that our theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental data obtained for polyelectrolytes and for DNA fragments of various molecular mass.

Monte Carlo simulations of particle diffusion in three dimensions were carried out to evaluate the influence of organelle structure on diffusive transport and to relate experimental photobleaching data to intrinsic diffusion coefficients. Two organelle structures were modeled: a mitochondria-like long closed cylinder containing fixed luminal obstructions of variable number and size, and an endoplasmic reticulum-like network of interconnected cylinders of variable diameter and density. Trajectories were computed in each simulation for &gt;10(5) particles, generally for &gt;10(5) time steps. Computed time-dependent concentration profiles agreed quantitatively with analytical solutions of the diffusion equation for simple geometries. For mitochondria-like cylinders, significant slowing of diffusion required large or wide single obstacles, or multiple obstacles. In simulated spot photobleaching experiments, a approximately 25% decrease in apparent diffusive transport rate (defined by the time to 75% fluorescence recovery) was found for a single thin transverse obstacle occluding 93% of lumen area, a single 53%-occluding obstacle of width 16 lattice points (8% of cylinder length), 10 equally spaced 53% obstacles alternately occluding opposite halves of the cylinder lumen, or particle binding to walls (with mean residence time = 10 time steps). Recovery curve shape with obstacles showed long tails indicating anomalous diffusion. Simulations also demonstrated the utility of measurement of fluorescence depletion at a spot distant from the bleach zone. For a reticulum-like network, particle diffusive transport was mildly reduced from that in unobstructed three-dimensional space. In simulated photobleaching experiments, apparent diffusive transport was decreased by 39-60% in reticular structures in which 90-97% of space was occluded. These computations provide an approach to analyzing photobleaching data in terms of microscopic diffusive properties and support the paradigm that organellar barriers must be quite severe to seriously impede solute diffusion.",

A fundamental question is how the diffusion coefficients of isolated polymers scale with molecular length and how they vary for different topologies. Here, diffusion coefficients D for relaxed circular, supercoiled, and linear DNA molecules of length L ranging from approximately 6 to 290 kbp were measured by tracking the Brownian motion of single molecules. A topology-independent scaling law D approximately L(-nu) was observed with nu(L) = 0.571 +/- 0.014, nu(C) = 0.589 +/- 0.018, and nu(S) = 0.571 +/- 0.057 for linear, relaxed circular, and supercoiled DNA, respectively, in good agreement with the scaling exponent of nu congruent with 0.588 predicted by renormalization group theory for polymers with significant excluded volume interactions. Our findings thus provide evidence in support of several theories that predict an effective diameter of DNA much greater than the Debye screening length. In addition, the measured ratio D(Circular)/D(Linear) = 1.32 +/- 0.014 was closer to the value of 1.45 predicted by using renormalization group theory than the value of 1.18 predicted by classical Kirkwood hydrodynamic theory and agreed well with a value of 1.31 predicted when incorporating a recently proposed expression for the radius of gyration of circular polymers into the Zimm model.",

It may be of interest to discuss the relevance of models concerning soluble molecules to surface-attached receptors. Let us consider two cell membranes bearing adhesion molecules within binding distance. A characteristic diffusion constant D for lateral diffusion is about 10 -10 cm 2 /s (as compared to 10,000 fold higher value in fluid phase for a sphere of 2 nm diameter). Thus, the time required for interacting molecules to exhibit a mutual displacement L of the order of molecular length, i.e. 10 nm, is \u2248 1 ms (i.e. L 2 /8D). This is much longer that the typical time for molecular rotations (i.e. about 0.1 \u00b5s for domains of flexible protein molecules ; Dandliker and de Saussure, 1970). This suggests that collision efficiency must be substantially higher between flexible membrane-bound molecules than between free molecules, because close contact is maintained for a higher amount of time. Association between flexible bound molecules should thus be essentially considered as diffusion-limited. If molecules are not fully flexible, the acquisition of a bound state is expected to be substantially impaired, and reaction rates should be dependent on the details of molecular shape and dynamics (see Pierres et al., 1998b, for very simplified quantitative estimates of the dependence of binding rate on membrane separation distance).",

Interleukin 8 (IL-8) secretion in the apical and basolateral directions over 24 h was not increased by exposure to the TSI and particle deposition. The rate of FITC-dex 4 (4 kDa) transport across the cell layer after deposition and dissolution of the particles in the cell surface secretions was approximately 20-fold higher (P&lt;0.05) than if applied as a solution. The volume of cell surface secretions was estimated by tracer dilution (3.44+/-1.90 microl, mean+/-SEM) and this value was used to calculate the P(app) of compound once deposited as a particle. The Papp value was found to be similar to that obtained when the compound was applied in solution (P&lt;0.05). Thus, the increased transport rate was attributable to the differences in donor chamber solute concentration rather than any change in the permeability of the cell layer itself. Following particle deposition, transport of FITC-dex with molecular weights between 4 and 70 kDa correlated well (r(2)=0.918) with reported in vivo canine pulmonary clearance after intratracheal instillation of dextrans of similar molecular weight. The use of the TSI and the Calu-3 cell line for the assessment of compound dissolution and transport rates after particle deposition may allow more realistic analyses to be made with respect to the in vivo situation.",

The diffusion constant D in equation (1) has to account for three simultaneous processes contributing to the spatial movement of cells. First, dividing cells occupy increasing space, therefore a certain part of D, say D p , has to account for the spatial expansion of proliferating cells. The authors of [6,8,19,30] have proposed relations of the type\nD p = k 1 2 T d .\nHere is related to the typical length or diameter of a cell and T d is the doubling time. The dimensionless factor k 1 in [8] accounts for the expansion of the viable rim of dividing cells. We take to be the average increase in cell diameter between mitotic events. We assume the area of an average cell increases from approximately 50 \u00b5m 2 to 100 \u00b5m 2 , so we take = 3.3 \u00b5m. We assume the average cycle time is\nT d = 16 h. We take D p = 0.1 \u00b5m 2 h \u22121 (order of magnitude)\n. Second, individual cells plated on a Petri dish do not remain fixed in their position but undergo a random walk. It is natural to assume that the random walk is not biased and follows the laws of Brownian motion. Third, cells in a cluster may break lose from that cluster as TGF-\u03b2 is known to decrease cell-cell adhesion [28]. Thus, a part of D, say D m , must account for this second and third contribution to cell movement. We propose here a modification of the standard Fisher-Kolmogorov equation (1). Our reasoning is that as the cells become more densely packed, their random motility should decrease. Thus, with U from equation (2) we propose\n\u2202 \u2202t u(x, y, t) = \u2207 \u00b7 (D(U )\u2207u(x, y, t)) + \u03b1u(x, y, t)(1 \u2212 \u03b2u(x, y, t)), D(U ) = D m 1 \u2212 U |\u2126| + D p .(3)",

FCS revealed that a large fraction of both intranuclear oligo(dT) (43%) and oligo(dA) (77%) moves rapidly with a diffusion coefficient of 4 x 10(-7) cm2/s. Interestingly, this rate of intranuclear oligo movement is similar to their diffusion rates measured in aqueous solution. In addition, we detected a large fraction (45%) of the intranuclear oligo(dT), but not oligo(dA), diffusing at slower rates (&lt;/=1 x 10(-7) cm2/s). The amount of this slower-moving oligo(dT) was greatly reduced if the oligo(dT) was prehybridized in solution with (unlabeled) oligo(dA) prior to introduction to cells, presumably because the oligo(dT) was then unavailable for subsequent hybridization to endogenous poly(A) RNA. The FCS-measured diffusion rate for much of the slower oligo(dT) population approximated the diffusion rate in aqueous solution of oligo(dT) hybridized to a large polyadenylated RNA (1.0 x 10(-7) cm2/s). Moreover, this intranuclear movement rate falls within the range of calculated diffusion rates for an average-sized heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle in aqueous solution. A subfraction of oligo(dT) (15%) moved over 10-fold more slowly, suggesting it was bound to very large macromolecular complexes. Average diffusion coefficients obtained from FRAP experiments were in agreement with the FCS data. These results demonstrate that oligos can move about within the nucleus at rates comparable to those in aqueous solution and further suggest that this is true for large ribonucleoprotein complexes as well.",

Local permeability of the NE at large intact nuclei (approximately 400 microm in diameter) isolated from Xenopus laevis oocytes was studied by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Steady-state tip current versus tip-nucleus distance curves (approach curves) were measured with 10- and 2-microm-diameter Pt disk microelectrodes at the nuclei in isotonic buffer solutions containing redox-active molecules. The approach curves in the normalized form are independent of the tip diameter, indicating diffusion-limited membrane transport of the redox molecules. SECM chronoamperometry demonstrated that a decrease in the steady-state tip current at short tip-nucleus distances is due to smaller diffusion coefficients and concentrations of the redox molecules in the nucleus than those in the buffer solution. The experimental approach curves fit very well with theoretical ones for freely permeable membranes, yielding the NE permeability to the molecules that is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than permeability of bilayer lipid membranes and cell membranes. This result indicates that passive transport of the redox molecules across the NE is facilitated by open NPC pores. The flux of the redox molecules sustainable by a single NPC channel (&gt;9.8 x 10(6) molecules per NPC per second) and the diameter of the channel pore (&gt;15 nm) were estimated from the SECM data by assuming the NE as an array of nanometer-sized NPC pores.

Mass transfer resistances of the collagen-coated filter support and the aqueous boundary layers were factored out to yield paracellular permeability coefficients (P[P]). As viewed from the P(P) values of urea and mannitol, EGTA exhibited insignificant effects on pore size at low concentrations compared with control, and then caused a dramatic opening of the TJs over a narrow concentration range (1.35-1.4 mM).

However, because the target site dimensions are as small as a nanometer, there is concern about whether diffusionlike models are appropriate or not. We first point out that we are by no means the first to apply the diffusion equation down to the length scales characterizing individual molecules: in the chemical physics literature there are numerous examples where diffusion-limited association rates are computed within this framework, and even small deviations from the theory are taken seriously. For the general application to biomolecular context, see the review in Ref. \u035315\u0354; a concrete case that couples 1D and 3D diffusions in an association problem for a lac transcription factor is derived in Ref. \u03534\u0354, and has been generalized to curved DNA geometry in Ref.\n\n\n\u03535\u0354.\n\nWith this remark in mind we note that our aim is to compute the equilibrium behavior of the occupancy of the binding site on long-time scales. We do not track the evolution of motion of a single molecule along the DNA, but actually imagine a number of molecules diffusing in the bulk and along the DNA. Our results will concern the noise in the \u2192 0 limit, or, more precisely, the noise averaged over times which are much longer than the characteristic time that the TF particle needs to diffuse over length scales of the receptor or sliding length. Concretely, the noise in gene regulation is generally averaged on the cell division or protein lifetime scale, both of which are in the range of at least minutes, while diffusion across a region 1 nm in size at D \u03f3 1 m 2 / s will take on the order of 1 s, and will be comparatively short even if such region is bigger by 2 orders of magnitude. This means that-over the relevant timescale-we will be able to define an ensemble of particles that samples the spatial neighborhood of the binding site extremely well and will thus be justified in using the diffusion equations. We expect that our continuous approach is inappropriate for probing small distances at short times, but this is not relevant here.\n\n\nIII. BINDING WITH 3D DIFFUSION",

For example, an 8-fold difference in molecular weight yields only a 2-fold difference in diffusion time. Thus it is difficult to distinguish monomer-dimer equilibria.",

However, the relationship between nuclear accumulation and the nucleocytoplasmic transport kinetics of Smad proteins in the presence of TGF-\u03b21 remains obscure. By combining a high-speed single-molecule tracking microscopy and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer technique, we tracked the entire TGF-\u03b21-induced process of Smad2/Smad4 heterocomplex formation, as well as their transport through nuclear pore complexes in live cells, with a high single-molecule localization precision of 2\u00a0ms and &lt;20\u00a0nm. Our single-molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer data have revealed that in TGF-\u03b21-treated cells, Smad2/Smad4 heterocomplexes formed in the cytoplasm, imported through the nuclear pore complexes as entireties, and finally dissociated in the nucleus. Moreover, we found that basal-state Smad2 or Smad4 cannot accumulate in the nucleus without the presence of TGF-\u03b21, mainly because both of them have an approximately twofold higher nuclear export efficiency compared to their nuclear import. Remarkably and reversely, heterocomplexes of Smad2/Smad4 induced by TGF-\u03b21 can rapidly concentrate in the nucleus because of their almost fourfold higher nuclear import rate in comparison with their nuclear export rate. Thus, we believe that the determined TGF-\u03b21-dependent transport configurations and efficiencies for the basal-state Smad or stimulated Smad heterocomplexes elucidate the basic molecular mechanism to understand their nuclear transport and accumulation.",

Each membrane molecule exhibits two diffusion coefficients: 1) the short-term diffusion coefficient, obtained on the time scale of 75 \u03bcs (25 \u03bcs \u00d7 3), representing the diffusion coefficient within a compartment (D micro ), and 2) the long-term diffusion coefficient, obtained on the time scale longer than the residency time within a compartment, representing the diffusion coefficient in space scales several times longer than the molecules actually undergo suppressed (more specifically, hop/confined) diffusion, and the simple-Brownian diffusion detected here is only true in the limited time scale >33 ms, representing long-term macroscopic diffusion. Similar observations and analyses for four other cell lines-HEPA-OVA, HeLa, T24, and NRK cells-revealed that TfR mostly undergoes effective simple-Brownian diffusion on the time scale of 33 ms to 1 s (30 video frames) in all of these cell types (Supplemental Table S1). Therefore the diffusion on this time scale can be described by a single effective diffusion coefficient, and here we used D eff (33 ms) 100 ms (obtained by the linear fitting of the MSD-\u2206t plot between 67 and 132 ms, with a midpoint of 100 ms, for data obtained at 33-ms time resolution), following Suzuki et al.

The phenomenon is treated as a diffusion of charge in a one-dimensional array of equally spaced and energetically equivalent temporary trapping sites. The solutions take into account the rates of charge hopping (k), side reactions (k(r)), and charge transfer to a terminal charge acceptor (k(t)). A detailed analysis of the time-dependent problem is performed for the diffusion-controlled regime, i.e., under the assumption that k(t) &gt;&gt; k, which is also equivalent to the fast relaxation limit of charge trapping. The analysis shows that the kinetics of charge hopping through DNA is always multiexponential, but under certain circumstances it can be asymptotically approximated by a single-exponential term. In that case, the efficiency of charge transfer can be characterized by a single rate constant k(CT) = 1.23kN(-2) + k(r), where N is the DNA length expressed in terms of the number of equidistant trapping sites and k(r) is the rate of competing chemical processes. The absolute yield of charge transfer under steady-state conditions in general is obtained as Y(infinity) = omega [alpha sinh(alphaN) + omega cosh(alphaN)](-1), where alpha = (2k(r)/k)(1/2) and omega = 2k(t)/k. For the diffusion-controlled regime and small N, in particular, it turns into the known \"algebraic\" dependence Y(infinity) = [1 + (k(r)/k)N(2)](-1). At large N the solution is asymptotically exponential with the parameter alpha mimicking the tunneling parameter beta in agreement with earlier predictions. Similar equations and distance dependencies have also been obtained for the damage ratios at the intermediate and terminal trapping sites in DNA. The nonlinear least-squares fit of one of these equations to experimental yields of guanine oxidation available from the literature returns kinetic parameters that are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by Bixon et al.

Filament formation is associated with, and may be dependent on, disulfide bridge formation between the hnRNP proteins. The reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol significantly attenuates filament assembly, and the residual material that forms is ultrastructurally distinct from the 7- to 10-nm fibers. In addition to the protein rearrangement leading to filament formation, nearly one-third of the protein present in chromatin-clarified nuclear extracts was converted to salt-insoluble material within 1 min of digestion with RNase.

Diffusion sets a limit for such cavitation to occur spontaneously, thereby defining a time scale below which active mechanisms must take over. We consider N independent diffusing particles in a closed domain, containing a subregion with N_{0} particles, on average. We investigate the time until the subregion is empty, allowing a subsequent reaction to proceed.

Testing such an approximation by experiment requires resolving the reactive transition paths of individual molecules, which is now becoming feasible with advanced single-molecule spectroscopic techniques. This has also sparked the interest of theorists in better understanding reactive transition paths. Here we focus on these issues aiming to establish (i) practical guidelines for the mechanistic interpretation of transition path times (TPT) and (ii) methods to extract the free energy surface and protein dynamics from the maximum likelihood analysis of photon trajectories (MLA-PT). We represent the (un)folding rates as diffusion on a 1D free energy surface with the FRET efficiency as a reaction coordinate proxy. We then perform diffusive kinetic simulations on surfaces with two minima and a barrier, but with different shapes (curvatures, barrier height, and symmetry), coupled to stochastic simulations of photon emissions that reproduce current SM-FRET experiments. From the analysis of transition paths, we find that the TPT is inversely proportional to the barrier height (difference in free energy between minimum and barrier top) for any given surface shape, and that dividing the TPT into climb and descent segments provides key information about the barrier's symmetry. We also find that the original MLA-PT procedure used to determine the TPT from experiments underestimates its value, particularly for the cases with smaller barriers (e.g., fast folders), and we suggest a simple strategy to correct for this bias. Importantly, we also demonstrate that photon trajectories contain enough information to extract the 1D free energy surface's shape and dynamics (if TPT is &gt;4-5-fold longer than the interphoton time) using the MLA-PT directly implemented with a diffusive free energy surface model. When dealing with real (unknown) experimental data, the comparison between the likelihoods of the free energy surface and discrete kinetic three-state models can be used to evaluate the statistical significance of the estimated free energy surface.",

The work was complemented by ab initio transition state theory based master equation calculations using reaction pathways investigated with highly accurate thermochemical protocols. The role of collisional stabilization of a CNCH3CN van der Waals complex and of tunneling induced H atom abstractions were also considered. The experimental pressure dependence at 52 and 132 K is well reproduced by the theoretical calculations provided that an anharmonic state density is considered for the van der Waals complex CH3CNCN and its Lennard-Jones radius is adjusted.

At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed.

The study is carried out at an intermediate level of supersaturation (away from the spinodal limit). In two dimensions, a surprisingly large cutoff (r(c) &gt; or = 7.0sigma, sigma is the diameter of LJ particles) in the truncation of the LJ potential is required to obtain converged results. A lower cutoff [typically 2.5sigma which is generally sufficient in three dimensional (3D) studies] leads to a substantial error in the values of the line tension, nucleation barrier, and characteristics of the critical cluster. It is found that in two dimensions, the classical nucleation theory (CNT) fails to provide a reliable estimate of the free energy barrier. It underestimates the barrier by as much as 50% at the saturation ratio S = 1.1 (defined as S = P/P(C), where P(C) is the coexistence pressure) and at the reduced temperature T(*) = 0.427 (defined as T(*) = k(B)T/epsilon, where epsilon is the depth of the potential well).

In fact, the agreement of the calculated nucleation rate with CNT is much worse in two dimensions than in three dimensions. The reason for the inadequacy of the CNT can be attributed to the noncircular nature of the critical clusters. Although the shape becomes increasingly circular and the clusters become more compact with increase in cutoff radius, an appreciable noncircular nature remains even without any cutoff to make the simple CNT inaccurate.",

The throat diameters d are within 0.26 mm &lt; or = d &lt; or = 0.62 mm, the half-opening-angle alpha within 4.2 degrees &lt; or = alpha &lt; or = 11.3 degrees, and the length L of the conical section is 17.5 mm (eight nozzles) or 12 mm (two nozzles). Thus the so-called \"equivalent sonic-nozzle diameter d(eq)\" for these conical nozzle geometries, defined by d(eq)=0.74 d/tan alpha (for monatomic gases), is in the range of 1.59 mm &lt; or = d(eq) &lt; or = 5.21 mm. Source temperature for the clustering experiments was T(0)=298 K, and the backing pressure P(0) was between 0.5 and 30 bars. The (average) cluster sizes observed for these conical nozzles deviate from the predictions of the simple stream-tube-model. These deviations are accounted for by introducing the so-called \"effective equivalent sonic-nozzle diameter d(eq)*,\" defined as the product of the equivalent sonic-nozzle diameter d(eq) and a new parameter delta, d(eq)*=deltad(eq). The parameter delta serves to modify the equivalent diameters d(eq) of the conical nozzles, which are applied in the idealized cases where the gas flows are suggested to be formed through free jet expansion. Then, delta represents the deviation of the performance in cluster formation of the practical conical nozzles from those predicted based on the idealized picture. The experimental results show that the values of delta can be described by an empirical formula, depending on the gas backing pressure P(0) and the parameter d(eq) of the conical nozzles. The degradation of the performance of the present conical nozzles was found with the increase in P(0) and the larger d(eq). It was revealed that delta is inversely proportional to a fractional power (approximately 0.5-0.6) of the molecular density n(mol) in the gas flows under the present experimental conditions. The boundary layers effects are considered to be mainly responsible for the restriction of the performance of the conical nozzles in cluster formation.",

While in the ambient pressure structure all V-V distances in the Kagom\u00e9 net are equal, they split into inter-trimer and intra-trimer distances in the high-pressure phase. In general, these changes are comparable to those observed in the corresponding low-temperature transition. However, the pressure-induced transition takes place at a lower unit-cell volume compared with the temperature-induced transition.

For a given configuration of molecules, a cavity is defined as a connected region where there is sufficient space to accommodate an additional molecule. By means of grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, we generated a series of equilibrium stable and metastable states along the adsorption-desorption isotherm of the LJ fluid in a slit-shaped pore of ten molecular diameters in width. The geometrical parameters of the cavity distributions were studied by Voronoi-Delaunay tessellation. We show that the cavity size distribution in liquidlike states, characterized by different densities, can be approximated by a universal log-normal distribution function. The mean void volume increases as the chemical potential &amp;mgr; and, correspondingly, the density decreases. The surface-to-volume relation for individual cavities fulfills the three-dimensional scaling S(cav)=gV(2/3)(cav) with the cavity shape factor g=8.32-9.55. The self-similarity of cavities is observed over six orders of magnitude of the cavity volumes. In the very vicinity of the stability limit, &amp;mgr;--&gt;&amp;mgr;(sl), large cavities are formed. These large cavities are ramified with a fractal-like surface-to-volume relation, S(cav) approximately V(cav).

A. Taatjes et al., Science 308, 1887 (2005)]. The removal mechanism of enols in combustion flame has not been established yet. In this work, the potential energy surface for the unimolecular decomposition of syn-propen-2-ol and H + CH(2)COHCH(2) recombination reactions have been first investigated by CCSD(T) method. The barrier heights, reaction energies, and geometrical parameters of the reactants, products, intermediates, and transition states have been investigated theoretically. The results show that the formation of CH(3)CO + CH(3) via the CH(3)COCH(3) intermediate is dominant for the unimolecular decomposition of syn-propen-2-ol and its branching ratio is over 99% in the whole temperature range from 700 to 3000 K, and its rate constant can be expressed as an analytical form in the range of T=700-3000 K at atmospheric pressure. This can be attributed to the lower energy barrier of this channel compared to the other channels. The association reaction of H with CH(2)COHCH(2) is shown to be a little more complicated than the unimolecular decomposition of syn-propen-2-ol. The channel leading to CH(3)CO + CH(3) takes a key role in the whole temperature range at atmospheric pressure. However at the higher pressure of 100 atm, the recombination by direct formation of syn-propen-2-ol through H addition is important at T&lt;1000 K. In the range of T&gt;1400 K, the recombination channel leading to CH(3)CO + CH(3) turns out to be significant.",

The free volume is calculated from the simulated cells of PVME by means of numerical methods based on grid scanning and probing the structure with a probe of a given radius R(P). The free-volume structure was found to be percolated for small probes at R(P)=0.53 A. As the probe radius increases, the cavity structure breaks into isolated cavities, reaching a maximum of the cavity number at R(P)=0.78 A. We further develop methods for a geometrical analysis of the free-volume cavities by considering their shape. The geometrical computations show that the cavities have elongated shape with side-to-length ratio corresponding to approximately 1:0.55 and with an average length of 6 A. Based on the overlap between the computed cavities and simplified geometrical representations, the best match of the cavity shape is obtained for the approximation to the ellipsoidal shape (overlap on 84.4%). A match with other examined shapes follows the sequence: ellipsoid&gt;cylinder&gt;bar&gt;sphere&gt;cube. Finally, the computed geometrical parameters are used as input parameters into the quantum-mechanical models for the orthopositronium (o-Ps) lifetime in various free-volume hole geometries. Comparison with the experimental data gives support for two ideas about the existence of an o-Ps particle in the polymeric matrix: (i) the positronium cannot localize in a portion of very small cavities; (ii) and in the case of the percolated cavities, several o-Ps particles occupy some subcavities in the same cavity. Additionally, radial distribution functions of the free volume indicate the existence of two kinds of free volume, a structured one, corresponding to interstitial spaces along the polymer chain, and the so-called \"bulk free volume,\" distributed randomly in the structure. PALS measurements seem to be mainly related with this bulk free volume. The cavities represented by the idealized geometries are visualized in three-dimensional space providing a unique representation on the free-volume structures.",

Integro-differential equations describing the profile and the density of a cylindrical (2D) drop were derived by the variational minimization of the Gibbs free energy with respect to both the drop profile and density under the assumption of uniform density. The equations were solved numerically using the constraint of a constant number of molecules N(l) per unit length of the drop. It was shown that for temperatures lower than a certain temperature Tw the free energy against density has generally two minima, representing a stable equilibrium state and a metastable one. One of those minima is located at a density corresponding to the density of a normal liquid, whereas the other one is located at a density comparable to the density of the surrounding inert gas. For this reason, the latter state of the drop cannot be stable. For T &gt; Tw, the minimum corresponding to the liquid state disappears, and no drop can be formed on the surface. The temperature Tw depends on N(l) and the external pressure p and increases when N(l) and p increase. The true wetting angle theta0 that the drop profile makes with the solid surface depends on the parameters characterizing the microscopic interactions, the density, and the surface densities. If in the thermodynamically stable state absolute value(cos theta0) &gt; 1, then no drop is formed on the surface. If in that state absolute value(cos theta0) &lt; 1, then at any pressure the true contact angle decreases when the temperature increases and approaches Tw. However, theta0 does not reach a zero value for T &lt; or = Tw but has for T = Tw a discontinuity from a finite to a zero value. The true contact angle also depends on the number of molecules in the drop and on the external pressure. For all considered values of N(l), p, and microscopic parameters of the intermolecular interactions, the density of the drop decreases with increasing temperature. The rate of decrease is constant for temperatures sufficiently far from Tw and increases when T approaches Tw. At a given temperature and pressure, the density of the drop decreases with decreasing N(l). For relatively large drops (N(l) approximately = 10(14)-10(20)), the rate of decrease is very small, whereas for small droplets (N(l) approximately = 10(12)) it becomes much larger.",

A superconducting transition temperature, T(c), as high as 133 kelvin has been measured in a multiphase Hg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O sample and found to be attributable to the Hg-1223 compound. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity measurements under pressure on a (&gt; 95%) pure Hg-1223 phase are reported. These data show that T(c) increases steadily with pressure at a rate of about 1 kelvin per gigapascal up to 15 gigapascals, then more slowly and reaches a T(c) = 150 kelvin, with the onset of the transition at 157 kelvin, for 23.5 gigapascals.

The role of the O-Ag interaction in the function of silver as an oxidation catalyst.That is, as the energy difference between bulk silver oxide (E total Ag2O ) and bulk silver (2E total Ag ), and the experimental value of the heat of formation (H f Ag2O\u2212bulk ) which is \u22120.323 eV. 23 The obtained results are displayed in Fig. 2. The range of \u2206\u00b5 O (defined as \u00b5 O \u2212 1 2 E total O2 ) between the vertical dashed lines corresponds to the heat of formation of Ag 2 O, i.e., to the range in which bulk silver oxide is stable. It can be seen that for more O-rich conditions (right) the thicker oxide-like structures are favored over chemisorption on the surface. Clearly, in the limit of an infinitely thick film, the corresponding line would be very close to the vertical one at \u2206\u00b5 O = \u22120.323 eV. It can be obtained from Fig. 2 that bulk silver oxide is stable to only around 350 K at atmospheric pressure, which is less than the experimental value of 460 K. At 460 K, the bulk oxide is unstable when the pressure is lower than 10 3 atm. i.e. compared to 1 atm. as observed experimentally. This difference may be due to systematic errors of the DFT approach 25 and/or to neglect of the entropy contributions. Therefore in Fig. 2 (and Fig. 3), we generally expect that the temperature is underestimated, but the error is less than 110 K, while correspondingly, the pressure is overestimated. For the temperature values quoted below, we give an estimate of the upper limit in brackets, that is, 110 K higher than that obtained from Fig. 2. In spite of these uncertainties, we believe that the relative stability of the various systems and our general understanding and conclusions will not be affected.",

On the basis of potential energy hypersurfaces obtained at the CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, high-pressure limiting rate coefficients have been calculated using variable reaction coordinate transition state theory. Over the temperature range 300-3000 K, the following expressions were obtained in units of cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1): k(infinity)(H + O2) = (25T(-0.367) + (7.5 x 10(-2)) T(0.702)) x 10(-11) and k(infinity)(H + OH) = (4.17 x 10(-11)) T(0.234)exp (57.5/T). Available experimental data on the pressure dependence of the reactions were analyzed using a two-dimensional master equation. The following low-pressure limiting rate coefficients were obtained over the temperature range 300-3000 K in units of cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1): k0(H + O2 + Ar) = (9.1x10(-29)) T(-1.404)exp (-134/T), k0(H + O2 + N2) = (2.0x10(-27)) T(-1.73)exp (-270/T), k0(H + OH + Ar) = (8.6x10(-28)) T(-1.527)exp (-185/T), and k0(H + OH + N2) = (1.25x10(-26)) T(-1.81)exp (-251/T). For the H + O2 reaction system, F(cent)(Ar) = 0.67 and F(cent)(N2) = 0.72 were obtained as center broadening factors, whereas F(cent)(Ar) = 0.72 and F(cent)(N2) = 0.73 were obtained for the H + OH reaction system.

The role of the O-Ag interaction in the function of silver as an oxidation catalyst.We turn now to investigate the effect of pressure and temperature on the stability of the various structures. To do this we calculate the surface free energy,\n\u03b3(T, p) = (G \u2212 N Ag \u00b5 Ag \u2212 N O \u00b5 O )/A ,(1)\nwhere G = G slab O/Ag(111) \u2212 G slab Ag(111) and the first and second terms on the right-hand-side are the free energies of the O/Ag surface under consideration and that of the reference system, i.e. the clean Ag(111) slab, respectively.

N Ag is the number of silver atoms (with respect to the reference system) and \u00b5 Ag is the Ag chemical potential, which is the free energy of an Ag atom 3 in bulk fcc silver. (Consideration of N Ag and \u00b5 Ag are necessary only for the substitutional structures and the (4 \u00d7 4) phase).

Through consideration of the difference in the vibrational and entropic contributions of G slab O/Ag(111) and G slab Ag(111) , we find that it can be neglected. 22 Thus, for evaluating the difference of the two G slab values, we replace G slab by the total energy.

On addition of alkali metal, we observe directly significant disruption of this hydrogen bonding. At 8 mol % metal there remains only around 0.7 hydrogen bond per nitrogen atom. This value decreases to 0.0 for the saturated solution of 21 mol % metal, as all ammonia molecules have then become incorporated into the tetrahedral first solvation spheres of the lithium cations.

In this secondary shell the nitrogen atoms tend to reside above the faces and edges of the primary tetrahedral shell. Furthermore, the computer-generated models reveal that on addition of alkali metal the solvent molecules form voids of approximate radius 2.5-3.0 A.

At the same level of idealization, the solvent-stabilized anion in ammonia can be viewed as an electron in a potential well that is shaped as a thin spherical layer (of nitrogen atoms in the first solvation shell), with some extension of the wavefunction towards the center of the cavity and towards the outside. Since both of these binding potentials are spherically symmetrical, the ground and excited states are s and p functions, in both of these two models. By suitable parameterization of these potentials and by allowing certain variation in these parameters, similar optical spectra can be obtained. Therefore, at the conceptual level it is very difficult to tell these two variants of the one-electron model apart.\n\nWe conclude that at some level of idealization, the many-electron and the one- In such a situation, the definitive test of the model is in its ability to reproduce the specific structural information, such as the spin density map given by the Knight shifts.\n\nFor ammonia, this evidence points away from the cavity-filling one-electron model and towards, at the very least, the spherical-shell one-electron model, which has its natural explanation in the multimer radical anion model examined above.\n\n\n22.\n\nHow general are these conclusions? Large Knight shifts for 14 N and 13 C nuclei for excess electron in dilute Na/methylamine solutions 31 suggest that electron solvation by the amino-and methyl-groups is qualitatively similar to that for the ammoniated electron. We have already suggested that electron solvation in alkanes 65 and acetonitrile 66 involves a solvent stabilized multimer anion with a fraction of the spin density transferred onto the frontier orbitals of C atoms in the methyl groups. It is very likely that a similar situation occurs in ethers, as such liquids also solvate the electron by their methyl and methylene groups. 68 The mode of electron solvation in alkanes (that comprise the largest class of electron trapping liquids) can be addressed experimentally, in two different ways.

It has been shown in preceding papers that when we separate solutions of electrolytes from pure water by collodion membranes the ions with the same sign of charge as the membrane increase while the ions with the opposite sign of charge diminish the rate of diffusion of water from the side of pure water to the side of solution; and that the accelerating and depressing effects of these ions on the rate of diffusion of water increase with their valency. 2. It is shown in this paper that aside from the valency a second quantity of the ion plays a r\u00f4le in this effect, namely the radius, which in a monatomic ion means the distance between the central positive nucleus and the outermost ring or shell of electrons of the ion. In monatomic, monovalent anions the radius increases in the order Cl&lt; Br&lt; I (being largest in I), while for monatomic, monovalent cations it increases in the order Li&lt; Na&lt; K&lt; Rb (being largest in Rb). 3. It is shown that the accelerating as well as the depressing effect of the anions mentioned increases directly with the order of magnitude of their radius and that the efficiency is greatest in the case of I which has the largest radius; while the accelerating as well as the depressing effect of cations increases inversely with the order of magnitude of their radius, Li with the smallest radius having the greatest efficiency. 4. This is intelligible on the assumption that the action of the ions is electrostatic in character, in the case of cations due to the electrostatic effect of the excess charge of their positive nucleus, and in the case of anions due to the excess charge of their captured electron. The electrostatic effect of the positive nucleus of a cation on the membrane (or any other body) will be the greater the smaller the ionic radius of the cation; and the electrostatic effect of an excess electron will be the greater the further its distance from its own positive nucleus. 5. It is suggested that this rule may possibly include polyatomic, monovalent ions (e.g. NO(3), CNS, etc.) when we replace these polyatomic ions by monatomic models in which the radius is calculated in such a way as to give the model the same electrostatic effect which the polyatomic ion possesses. 6. These conclusions are in harmony with the fact that the efficiency of ions increases also with their valency. 7. It is suggested that these rules concerning the influence of the ionic radius can possibly be demonstrated in other phenomena, depending on the electrostatic effect of ions.",

In particular, the recent suggestion that the energetics of solvation is solely a function of water density [12] does not appear to be supported experimentally.

For such solvents as liquid water and ammonia, the trap is more than 1 eV below the CB of the liquid and thermal excitation of the electron into the CB is impossible. Solvated electrons in such liquids move adiabatically, following fast molecular motions in the liquid; in lowtemperature solids, such electrons undergo trap-to-trap tunneling in competition with deepening of the traps due to the relaxation of the cavity, which may take as long as micro-and milliseconds at 20-100 K. In nonpolar liquids, some of which (e.g., alkanes) also yield solvated electrons, the traps are just 100-200 meV below the CB and thermal excitation of the electrons localized in such traps is sufficient to promote the electron back into the CB. Such electrons perpetually oscillate between the bottom of the CB and the solvent traps.

From Figure 5, for Q H =0 the cavity is larger than 2 \u22125/6 \u03c3 (=1.78 A), since the solvent peak does not start until after 2\u00c5, and the CT results, which use 1.77 as a cavity radius, therefore overestimate the free energy at low charges (see Figures 2). This raises a question as to whether the differences between the simulation and CT calculations are due to the approximation of a continuum solvent or just an inconsistent choice of cavity size. Estimates of the cavity size can perhaps be found from an examination of the liquid structure, although assigning a sharp solute/solvent boundary from a continuous distribution is ambiguous. A simple heuristic method is to find the radius which gives the best value for the Coulomb energy, U es . For each value of Q H the optimal oxygen radius is found (the hydrogen radius is set equal to a constant value of 0.8\u00c5) and the free energy is calculated from Eq. 4. The resulting U es and \u2206A es are in almost exact agreement with the simulation values (see Table   1). Of course, this agreement is by construction and with one adjustable parameter it is a trivial accomplishment to fit the simulation energies. However, this method also gives good values for the electric fields, which is not by construction(see Figure   6). The optimized oxygen radius is shown for each value of the hydrogen charge in At high charges the semicontinuum results are different from the continuum results.",

The spectrotemporal response is interpreted using the nonadiabatic relaxation mechanism for cavity-bound solvated electrons in condensed phases. In particular, we develop a local density-jump model, which traces the dynamic spectrum back to a sequence of a pump-induced cavity expansion due to Pauli repulsion and a succeeding cavity contraction upon nonadiabatic return of the electron back to its ground state. Using the existing thermodynamic data of the solvent and experimental temperature and density-dependent absorption spectra of metal-ammonia solutions, an overall increase in the interparticle distance within the solvent cavity of 25% is crudely estimated.

Despite all this interest, there is still considerable debate over the molecular structure of the hydrated electron: does it occupy a cavity, have a significant number of interior water molecules, or have a structure somewhere in between? The reason for all this debate is that different computer simulations have produced each of these different structures, yet the predicted properties for these different structures are still in reasonable agreement with experiment. In this Feature Article, we explore the reasons underlying why different structures are produced when different pseudopotentials are used in quantum simulations of the hydrated electron. We also show that essentially all the different models for the hydrated electron, including those from fully ab initio calculations, have relatively little direct overlap of the electron's wave function with the nearby water molecules. Thus, a non-cavity hydrated electron is better thought of as an \"inverse plum pudding\" model, with interior waters that locally expel the surrounding electron's charge density. Finally, we also explore the agreement between different hydrated electron models and certain key experiments, such as resonance Raman spectroscopy and the temperature dependence and degree of homogeneous broadening of the optical absorption spectrum, in order to distinguish between the different simulated structures. Taken together, we conclude that the hydrated electron likely has a significant number of interior water molecules. ",

The column density of all the 15 NH 3 gas giving rise to this absorption then depends on which excitation temperature most accurately describes the population distribution and what the OPR is.

Instead, if most of this absorption were to originate in the warm envelope (T kin =20-40 K, Lis & Goldsmith 1991) with the same column density of 14 NH 3 as found by Ceccarelli et al.

In this model, most of the excess electron density resides in the frontier orbitals of N atoms in the ammonia molecules forming the solvation cavity; a fraction of this spin density is transferred to the molecules in the second solvation shell. The cavity is formed due to the repulsion between negatively charged solvent molecules. Using density functional theory calculations for small ammonia cluster anions in the gas phase, it is demonstrated that such core anions would semi-quantitatively account for the observed pattern of Knight shifts for 1 H and 14 N nuclei observed by NMR spectroscopy and the downshifted stretching and bending modes observed by infrared spectroscopy. It is speculated that the excess electrons in other aprotic solvents (but not in water and alcohols) might be, in this 2.respect, analogous to the ammoniated electron, with substantial transfer of the spin density into the frontier N and C orbitals of methyl, amino, and amide groups forming the solvation cavity.",

This is also true for the DB18C6 backbone atoms. The solvent above the cavity will have longer distances to the atoms of DB18C6 than the solvent below it. Those increases in the distances between the solute and solvent are better represented in Figure 5, where the solvent cavities of K + -, Rb + -, and Cs + -DB18C6 in aqueous solution are visualized using the GeomView program [42]. The extent of increase in the distances from the solvent above and below the cavity to the solute atoms will be larger for Cs + -than for Rb + -DB18C6 due to the higher position of Cs + above the cavity. Those increases in the distances between the solute and solvent depending on the position of the metal cation above the cavity may lead to the decrease in the dispersion energy from K + -to Cs + -DB18C6.\n\n\nTheoretical methods",

The y(1)P \u2190 a(1)S resonance transitions in the visible spectral region are used to compare the isolation conditions of these two metal atom systems and calcium. Complex absorption bands were recorded in all three metal atom systems even after extensive sample annealing. Coupled cluster calculations conducted on the ground states of the nine M \u22c5 RG diatomics (M = Ca, Sr, and Ba; RG = Ar, Kr, and Xe) at the coupled cluster single, double, and non-iterative triple level of theory revealed long bond lengths (&gt;5 \u00c5) and shallow bound regions (&lt;130 cm(-1)). All of the M \u22c5 RG diatomics have bond lengths considerably longer than those of the rare gas dimers, with the consequence that isolation of these metal atoms in a single substitutional site of the solid rare gas is unlikely, with the possible exception of Ca/Xe. The luminescence of metal dimer bands has been recorded for Ba and Sr revealing very different behaviours. Resonance fluorescence with a lifetime of 15 ns is observed for the lowest energy transition of Sr2 while this transition is quenched in Ba2. This behaviour is consistent with the absence of vibrational structure on the dimer absorption band in Ba2 indicating lifetime broadening arising from efficient relaxation to low-lying molecular states.

BerylliumThe behaviour of an impurity atom in a metal has been considered by Wilson.* Consider a lattice of N atoms, one of which is different from the r e s t; if the interaction is negligible, we have (N -1) states of equal energy in which an electron is removed from one of the like atoms, and just one state of a different energy in which an electron is removed from the impurity. I t is evident that, when one allows for interaction, the (N -1) states will split up into a band with a definite energy-range (the band of the valence-or conduction-electrons) the one state, though it may be perturbed, will remain sharp. I t follows that, if the interaction is not too great, an impurity may be regarded as existing in the metal as a discrete entity, atom or ion, and forming a \" hole \" into which the metallic valence-electrons cannot penetrate. Its actual state depends on how many electrons it can profitably \" capture \" from the metal, if we imagine it to be introduced in a heavily ionized condition. Thus it will go on taking electrons until the binding-energy of the next captured electron would be less than the binding-energy to the metal as a whole. Consider the K-ionized lithium and beryllium atoms as \" impurities \" which do not take part in the chemical binding of the lattice. Since the ionization potentials of both as free atoms in a K-excited neutral condition are about 8 volts, each must exist, in the state of lowest energy of the whole system, as a neutral atom in a \" hole \" in the metal, having thus L-shells of two and three electrons respec tively. It is also clear that there must be a number of discrete states of the metal corresponding to the excited, ionized, and ionized and excited states of the \" impurity \" atom. These will be found experimentally as a number of discrete K-excitation potentials of the metal, VK2, VK3, ... of higher voltage than the minimum K-excitation potential, Vk1* As we have seen, these are actually observed.",

In contrast, in weakly polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), the solvated electron has an absorption spectrum that peaks in the mid-infrared, but no definitive assignment has been offered about the origins of the spectrum or the underlying structure. In this paper, we present the results of adiabatic mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamic simulations of the solvated electron in THF, and provide a detailed explanation of the THF-solvated electron's absorption spectrum and electronic structure. Using a classical solvent model and a fully quantum mechanical excess electron, our simulations show that although the ground and first excited states are bound in a quasispherical cavity, a multitude of other, nearby solvent cavities support numerous, nearly degenerate, bound excited states that have little Franck-Condon overlap with the ground state. We show that these solvent cavities, which are partially polarized so that they act as electron trapping sites, are an inherent property of the way THF molecules pack in the liquid. The absorption spectrum is thus assigned to a sum of bound-to-bound transitions between a localized ground state and multiple disjoint excited states scattered throughout the fluid. Furthermore, we find that the usual spherical harmonic labels (e.g., s-like, p-like) are not good descriptors of the excited-state wave functions of the solvated electron in THF. Our observation of multiple disjoint excited states is consistent with femtosecond pump-probe experiments in the literature that suggest that photoexcitation of solvated electrons in THF causes them to relocalize into solvent cavities far from where they originated.",

Equally important would be revisiting the EPR of hydrated electrons trapped in alkaline ices 70 since hyperfine couplings for 17 O nuclei for the hydrated electron have never been determined and thus quantitative estimates as to the degree of penetration of the electron density on the frontier orbitals of oxygen atoms are lacking. Considerable downshifts for bending and stretching modes in the Raman spectra of the hydrated electron 47,48 and the prominent 180 nm absorption band in its optical spectrum 71 provide indirect evidence for partial occupation of these orbitals by the electron.

These potentials usually are highly repulsive, producing cavity-bound hydrated electrons that break the local water H-bonding structure. However, we recently developed a more attractive potential, which produces a hydrated electron that encompasses a region of enhanced water density. Both our noncavity and the various cavity models predict similar experimental observables. In this paper, we work to distinguish between these models by studying both the temperature dependence of the optical absorption spectrum, which provides insight into the balance of the attractive and repulsive terms in the potential, and the resonance Raman spectrum, which provides a direct measure of the local H-bonding environment near the electron. We find that only our noncavity model can capture the experimental red shift of the hydrated electron's absorption spectrum with increasing temperature at constant density. Cavity models of the hydrated electron predict a solvation structure similar to that of the larger aqueous halides, leading to a Raman O-H stretching band that is blue-shifted and narrower than that of bulk water. In contrast, experiments show the hydrated electron has a broader and red-shifted O-H stretching band compared with bulk water, a feature recovered by our noncavity model. We conclude that although our noncavity model does not provide perfect quantitative agreement with experiment, the hydrated electron must have a significant degree of noncavity character.",

The method has been applied to the hydrogen abstraction reaction H+NH(3)--&gt;H(2)+NH(2). Initial state-selected total reaction probabilities are investigated for the reactions from the ground vibrational state and from four excited vibrational states of ammonia. The total reaction probabilities from two lowest \"tunneling doublets\" due to the inversion barrier for the umbrella bending motion of NH(3) and from two pairs of doubly degenerate vibrational states of NH(3) are also inspected. Integral cross sections and rate constants are calculated for the reaction from the ground state with the centrifugal-sudden approximation. The calculated results are compared with those from the previous seven dimensional calculations [M. Yang and J. C. Corchado, J. Chem. Phys. 126, 214312 (2007)]. This work shows that the full dimensional rate constants are a factor of 3 larger than the corresponding seven dimensional calculated values at T=200 K and are overall smaller than those obtained from the variational transition state theory in the whole temperature region. The work also reveals that nonreactive NH bonds of NH(3) cannot be treated as spectators due to the fact that three NH bonds are coupled with each other during the reaction process.",

These different cases, A, B, and C, are shown in Figure 2. The equations used to compute the position vector of the new spheres, r N , are provided in Data S1. Regarding the radii of the spheres for the SES-type cavity, we adopt the same strategy that for the vdW-type cavity, which is scaling the vdW radius of each atom by a scaling factor f, with f being equal to 1.2. The radii of the new GEPOL spheres (those that are not associated to atoms) are calculated from the radii of the pair of spheres considered to create it, as well as from the distance between them and from the radius of the solvent molecule R S . In order to determine R S for each solvent, we start from the Stokes-Einstein formula, [31] that gives the radius, R SE , of a sphere that diffuses at the same rate as the solvent under consideration,\nR SE = k B T 6\u03c0\u03b7D\u00f019\u00de\nwhere D is the self-diffusion coefficient of the solvent, \u03b7 its viscosity, k B the Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The accuracy of the van der Waals well depth, approximately 200 cm(-1), was checked by means of additional calculations at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples level and it was concluded that previous empirical estimates are unrealistic. Also, the electric dipole function was calculated, analytically fitted in the regions of the two wells, and used to analyze the charge shifts along the reaction path. In the insertion well, 16,800 cm(-1) deep, the electric dipole function confirmed the ionic structure of the HCaCl complex and served to estimate effective atomic charges.

Only the species in which some electron density is located inside this cavity (or the interstitial voids between the solvent molecules) can be rightfully called the \"solvated electron.\" All such species exhibit a characteristic broad, asymmetric absorption band in the VIS (visible) or NIR (near infrared) most of which is from s-p excitation of the s-like ground state electron to three nodal plike (bound) excited states (for electrons in deep traps in polar solvents) or free p-waves in the conduction band (CB), in less polar and nonpolar solvents. Since the cavity is slightly anisotropic, these p-like states are nondegenerate, and the VIS-NIR band is a superposition of three homogeneously broadened p-subbands. The more anisotropic is the cavity, the greater is the energy splitting between the centroids of these three subbands. To the blue of this composite s-p band, there is usually a Lorentzian \"tail\" extending towards the UV, due to the transitions from the ground state directly into the CB of the liquid. Some other excitations (s-d) might also contribute to this \"tail\" absorbance, according to the theory. [44][45][46]62] So characteristic is this \"a bell and a tail\" composite spectrum that most of the \"solvated electrons\" in liquids have been identified by this feature alone. Another distinguishing property of the solvated electron is pronounced temperature dependence of this spectrum, [13,14] with systematic red shift of the absorption peak and broadening of the absorption line with the increasing temperature. Solvated electron is, in fact, one of the best molecular \"thermometers\" in chemistry. These trends are commonly 6.",

Like all matter, electrons have both wave and particle properties (as theorized by Louis-Victor de Broglie), and their wave-like properties mean that a beam of electrons can be focused and diffracted much like light can. The wavelength of electrons is related to their kinetic energy via the de Broglie equation, which says that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum.

The relativistic nature of MeV UED helps minimize space-charge repulsion effects to subsequently generate a high bunch charge electron pulse with a temporal resolution of ~100 fs (FWHM). A schematic of a typical MeV UED set-up based on one used at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) [Weathersby2015, Yang2018a, Yang2018b, Shen2019] is shown in Fig. 3.4A. In this SLAC MeV UED set-up, relativistic UED beams with an electron kinetic energy of 1 -4 MeV are typically generated through an S-band 1.6-cell photocathode RF gun consisting of two RF cavities (a half cell and a full cell), with a cross-sectional schematic shown in Fig. 3.4B [Weathersby2015, Yang2018b]. In the half-cell, a thin copper photocathode is impinged by a short (~100 fs), ultraviolet (266 nm) laser pulse generated by the frequency tripled output of an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser system. This generates a pulse of electrons in a similar way to that of keV UED. What is different here in the MeV UED case is that the emitted electron pulse is then accelerated out of the RF cavity to much higher (MeV) kinetic energies using the relatively high electric field (>100 MV/m) [Akre2008] in the cavity as compared to keV UED (1-10 MV/m) in order to achieve electron pulses with pulse durations close to 100 fs (FWHM) [Chatelain2012].

However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a \u00b4 of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of \u00b0{\u2122 to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing \u00b3 is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to \u0394 . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 \u00b5m, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016].

Therefore, photoinduced structural dynamics on the femtosecond to picosecond timescales can be directly observed in a diffraction manner by using these pulses. This research created a tabletop ultrashort pulsed electron diffraction setup that used a femtosecond laser and electron pulse compression cavity that was directly synchronized to the microwave master oscillator (\u223c3\u00a0GHz). A compressed electron pulse with a 1\u00a0kHz repetition rate contained 228\u2009000 electrons. The electron pulse duration was estimated to be less than 100\u00a0fs at the sample position by using photoinduced immediate lattice changes in an ultrathin silicon film (50\u00a0nm). The newly developed time-resolved electron diffraction setup has a pulse duration that is comparable to femtosecond laser pulse widths (35-100\u00a0fs).

The angular range of typical operation in UED (green shaded area) shows that \u00eb is a factor of 20 lower than \u00ec , making it quite challenging to locate the position of hydrogen atoms within a molecule using UED imaging experiments. Whilst in the case of LIED, the \u00eb / \u00ec ratio approaches within one-orderof-magnitude (e.g. 0.5 ratio at 50 eV, and 0.2 ratio at 100 eV), enabling LIED to resolve the atomic positions of both light and heavy atoms in a target structure across a wide variety of \u00ea . In particular, the appreciable scattering amplitude of hydrogen obtained with LIED makes it sensitive to locating the positions of hydrogen atoms in molecules, which other techniques (e.g. UED, non-covariance/coincidence CEI) are insensitive to and instead use heavier \"tag\" atoms such as halogens (i.e. iodine, bromine) to identify the molecular structure. This is particularly significant as most molecules contain hydrogen atoms, which in fact play a pivotal role in many biological and chemical processes such as hydrogen bonding in DNA and proton motion during respiration.

Due to an elastic scattering cross section that is larger by about a factor of \u223c 10 6 for 30 keV electrons compared to 12 keV photons along with the fact that inelastic, destructive reactions (electron impact excitation) occur with smaller cross sections and a factor of thousand less energy deposition compared to photon absorption, the number of electrons in the beam needed to record images as well as unwanted modifications of the sample molecules are significantly reduced [10]. In the most promising 'conventional gun' scenario, bunches of up to 10 5 electrons of 30 keV within \u223c 600 fs focused to spot sizes of 200 \u00b5m have been demonstrated to be feasible recently and structural information has been achieved. 100 fs pulse durations for bunches of 10 4 electrons seem to be feasible optimizing existing gun designs [10].",

In particular, these models allow the classical trajectories to be calculated and mapped to experimental features, enabling the energy and propagation times of the returning electrons to be characterized. Measurements can be performed in the quasistatic regime (i.e. \u2248 0.3) by either increasing the peak laser intensity, 3 , or using a longer driver wavelength, . Fig. 4.8A shows that at a fixed peak laser intensity, 3 , of 1 \u00d7 10 M\u00e4 Wcm -2 typically used in near-infrared (NIR) measurements, one can perform measurements deep into the quasistatic regime by using a longer driver wavelength, . Whereas increasing the peak laser intensity has the disadvantage of depleting the number of ground-state molecules before the peak of the laser pulse, which is strongly dependent on the \u00c9 of the molecule. This leads to a decrease in the number of rescattered electrons generated as a result of an increase in the direct ionization of molecules on the rising edge of the laser pulse. Thus, it is important to achieve an ionization fraction of much less than unity to have sufficient neutral target density to perform rescattering measurements. To exemplify this point, Fig. 4.8B shows the fraction of molecules ionized at the peak of a six cycle laser pulse as a function of driver wavelength for two molecules at = 0.3: (i) naphthalene with an \u00c9 of 8 eV (which is a typical \u00c9 for most relatively large organic molecules), and (ii) acetylene with an \u00c9 of 12 eV. In the case of acetylene with a relatively high \u00c9 , achieving a = 0.3 at 0.8 \u00b5m requires a peak intensity of > 1 \u00d7 10 M\u00e5 Wcm -2 which leads to an ionization fraction of unity, already reaching ionization saturation. Whilst an ionization fraction of <0.01 with 3 < 1 \u00d7 10 M\u00e4 Wcm -2 is achievable at the longer wavelength of 3.1 \u00b5m.

The bandwidth, efficiency, coherence, and electron pulse duration are investigated in dependence on excitation wavelength, intensity, and laser bandwidth. At photon energies close to the cathode's work function, the electron pulse duration shortens significantly and approaches a threshold that is determined by interplay of the optical pulse width and the acceleration field. An optimized choice of laser wavelength and bandwidth results in sub-100-fs electron pulses.

The laser pulse is divided with a non-polarizing beam splitter and propagates along two paths. The first path, using approximately 10% of the total power, passes through two BBO crystals to frequency triple the pulse before imaging the beam onto a photocathode to generate electrons. The remaining power (the pump pulse) is sent to a delay stage to control the timing delay between the electrons and laser pulse. The pump pulse is then reflected off a grating to tilt the intensity front. Tilting the pulse reduces the temporal blurring caused by group velocity mismatch. 31,32 The laser is introduced to the sample chamber at a 60 angle relative to electron propagation. This matches the velocity of the laser and electron beams along the direction of propagation of the electrons. Figure 2 shows how the intensity front of the electron and laser pulses point parallel to electron propagation, as well as how the pulses from each beam overlap temporally. The tilted pulse is imaged onto the gas jet where it is measured to have a 260 lm (V) \u00c2 190 lm (H) FWHM diameter and 200 fs pulse duration.

In the present work, we describe the prototype setup of the electron diffractometer used in this study. At the core of the prototype diffractometer was an EIGER X 1M detector (DECTRIS Ltd), a hybrid pixel detector that is frequently used in X-ray crystallography but that is also suitable for detecting electrons (Tinti et al., 2018). This hybrid pixel detector has a negligible readout time of 3 ms, which enables shutterless, continuous data collection (Broennimann et al., 2006). It has a frame rate of up to 3 kHz, although in this study it was operated at 100 Hz. This enables fine-slicing of data (Pflugrath, 1999;Casanas et al., 2016) at a fast rotation of the sample for instruments where the beam intensity cannot be arbitrarily reduced. The sensor layer of 450 mm makes it radiation-hard at electron energies of 200 keV and makes a beam stop unnecessary (Tinti et al., 2018). The EIGER X 1M has a high count rate of 0.5 \u00c2 10 8 s \u00c01 mm \u00c02 , which was saturated only by the top 2-3 pixels of the direct beam and by none of the reflections. At 100 Hz, the dynamic range of 16 bit was well above all recorded intensities. The detector is noise-free, and only scattering inside the TEM added to the noise in the data.

Transient absorption kinetics of the hydrated electron, e(aq) (-), have been observed, from a few hundred femtoseconds out to 600 ps, and studied as function of hydroxide concentration and temperature. The geminate decay kinetics are bimodal, with a fast exponential component ( approximately 13 ps) and a slower power \"tail\" due to the diffusional escape of the electrons. For the biphotonic excitation, the extrapolated fraction of escaped electrons is 1.8 times higher than for the monophotonic 200 nm excitation (31% versus 17.5% at 25 degrees C, respectively), due to the broadening of the electron distribution.

For specimens thicker than a few tens of nm, the image intensity and scattering contrast are likely to be higher than at lower voltage, as is the visibility of ionization edges below 1000eV (as required for EELS elemental analysis). In thick (&gt;100nm) specimens, higher voltage ensures less beam broadening and better spatial resolution for STEM imaging and EDX spectroscopy. Low-voltage (e.g. 30kV) TEM or STEM is attractive for a very thin (e.g. 10nm) specimen, as it provides higher scattering contrast and fewer problems for valence-excitation EELS. Specimens that are immune to radiolysis suffer knock-on damage at high current densities, and this form of radiation damage can be reduced or avoided by choosing a low accelerating voltage. Low-voltage STEM with an aberration-corrected objective lens (together with a high-angle dark-field detector and/or EELS) offers atomic resolution and elemental identification from very thin specimens. Conventional TEM can provide atomic resolution in low-voltage phase-contrast images but requires correction of chromatic aberration and preferably an electron-beam monochromator. Many non-conducting (e.g. organic) specimens damage easily by radiolysis and radiation damage then determines the TEM image resolution. For bright-field scattering contrast, low kV can provide slightly better dose-limited resolution if the specimen is very thin (a few nm) but considerably better resolution is possible from a thicker specimen, for which higher kV is required. Use of a phase plate in a conventional TEM offers the most dose-efficient way of achieving atomic resolution from beam-sensitive specimens. ",

Electron pulse generation\n\nThe development of the electron source and the generation of ultrafast electron pulses played a vital role in the establishment of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The developments that are being carried out on the electron source focus on the enhancement of the temporal and spatial coherent resolution to capture faster dynamics of matter with higher resolution.\n\nSpatial coherence, which is defined through the maximum distance between two objects for which interference is still visible on the screen, is a critical parameter of the electron source and is determined by the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths of the source (see Section 3). On the other hand, the temporal resolution is defined by the electron pulse duration and the phase stability at the interaction stage. Both the temporal and spatial resolutions are reduced by the space-charge effect due to Coulomb repulsion of electrons in the wave packet [114], as discussed earlier in Section 2. The electron beam intensity requirements for the source are more difficult to define, since they depend on the sample under study, namely on the phase (i.e., solid, gas), the thickness, which should be in the range of 10-100 nm, and the background. Nevertheless, at least ~ 10 4 -10 5 electrons per pulse are needed to clearly resolve the diffraction peak and/or obtain a clear image in UED and UEM, respectively [18]. From the theoretical modelling and experimental study, it is obvious that it is impossible to use the conventional electron gun parameters to attain sub-ps electron pulses at the sample position with reasonable electron number densities [114][115][116]. In the pioneering work by Siwick and Miller on implementing a compact electron gun design, 600 fs pulse durations with up to 10,000 electrons per pulse were achieved [22]. This paved the way for the development of a source of high-brightness electron beams with pulse durations on the order of hundred femtoseconds, based on Radio Frequency (RF) compression [96,102,117], which will be discussed later.\n\n\n.

The relativistic nature of MeV UED helps minimize space-charge repulsion effects to subsequently generate a high bunch charge electron pulse with a temporal resolution of ~100 fs (FWHM). A schematic of a typical MeV UED set-up based on one used at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) [Weathersby2015, Yang2018a, Yang2018b, Shen2019] is shown in Fig. 3.4A. In this SLAC MeV UED set-up, relativistic UED beams with an electron kinetic energy of 1 -4 MeV are typically generated through an S-band 1.6-cell photocathode RF gun consisting of two RF cavities (a half cell and a full cell), with a cross-sectional schematic shown in Fig. 3.4B [Weathersby2015, Yang2018b]. In the half-cell, a thin copper photocathode is impinged by a short (~100 fs), ultraviolet (266 nm) laser pulse generated by the frequency tripled output of an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser system. This generates a pulse of electrons in a similar way to that of keV UED. What is different here in the MeV UED case is that the emitted electron pulse is then accelerated out of the RF cavity to much higher (MeV) kinetic energies using the relatively high electric field (>100 MV/m) [Akre2008] in the cavity as compared to keV UED (1-10 MV/m) in order to achieve electron pulses with pulse durations close to 100 fs (FWHM) [Chatelain2012].

However, this introduces a temporal jitter of 300 -400 fs between the pulsed electron beam and optical pulse used to generate the electron beam. A time-stamping procedure overcomes this optical-electron timing jitter, achieving a \u00b4 of <100 fs as demonstrated in condensed matter UED studies [Gao2013]. Specifically, the timestamping procedure uses a laser-triggered streak camera to record the arrival time of each electron pulse, allowing for the arrival times to be resorted on a shot-to-shot basis [Gao2013]. Moreover, correction of \u00b0{\u2122 to the attosecond timescale has been proposed using a lasercycle streaking method [Gliserin2016]. Another possibility in reducing \u00b3 is to minimize the propagation distance of the electron beam to the target sample, with the ability to reach down to 500 fs for a 25 keV non-relativistic pulse. However, regardless of the propagation distance, the GVM between the optical excitation pulse and the non-relativistic electron probe pulse as they traverse the target sample will contribute significantly to \u0394 . This is typically not a problem with optical-pump optical-probe measurements since both pulses will traverse the target sample at the speed of light in vacuum, . For example, a beam of non-relativistic 25 keV electrons with a speed of 0.31 will take 4.3 ps to traverse a gaseous molecular beam with a diameter of 400 \u00b5m, whilst it will take 1.3 ps for the optical pulse with a speed of to travel the same distance. Thus, the GVM of roughly 3 ps will significantly contribute to the temporal blurring of the transient structures in time-resolved UED measurements. In fact, GVM not only arises from differences between the velocities of the optical and electron beams but additional temporal broadening also arises from non-collinear geometric overlap of the two pulses. Minimising the effects of GVM and temporal broadening can be achieved by (i) accelerating the pulsed electron beam to relativistic kinetic energies (i.e. 1 -4 MeV) as well as (ii) using a collinear geometry [Williamson1993, Centurion2016].

Precession frequencies can be varied from Hz to kHz, but in standard cases 60 Hz has been used. In choosing a precession rate, it is important to ensure that many revolutions of the beam occur over the relevant exposure time used to record the diffraction pattern. This ensures adequate averaging over the excitation error of each reflection. Beam sensitive samples may dictate shorter exposure times and thus, motivate the use of higher precession frequencies.",

The x-ray and electron's typical and de Broglie wavelengths are shorter than lattice constants of materials and molecules. Therefore, photoinduced structural dynamics on the femtosecond to picosecond timescales can be directly observed in a diffraction manner by using these pulses. This research created a tabletop ultrashort pulsed electron diffraction setup that used a femtosecond laser and electron pulse compression cavity that was directly synchronized to the microwave master oscillator (\u223c3\u00a0GHz). A compressed electron pulse with a 1\u00a0kHz repetition rate contained 228\u2009000 electrons. The electron pulse duration was estimated to be less than 100\u00a0fs at the sample position by using photoinduced immediate lattice changes in an ultrathin silicon film (50\u00a0nm). The newly developed time-resolved electron diffraction setup has a pulse duration that is comparable to femtosecond laser pulse widths (35-100\u00a0fs). The pulse duration, in particular, fits within the timescale of photoinduced phenomena in quantum materials.

The main challenges are the Coulomb force that leads to broadening of the electron pulses and the temporal blurring that results from the velocity mismatch between the laser and electron pulses as they traverse the sample. We present here a device that uses pulse compression to overcome the Coulomb broadening and deliver femtosecond electron pulses on a gas target. The velocity mismatch can be compensated using laser pulses with a tilted intensity front to excite the sample.

The angular range of typical operation in UED (green shaded area) shows that \u00eb is a factor of 20 lower than \u00ec , making it quite challenging to locate the position of hydrogen atoms within a molecule using UED imaging experiments. Whilst in the case of LIED, the \u00eb / \u00ec ratio approaches within one-orderof-magnitude (e.g. 0.5 ratio at 50 eV, and 0.2 ratio at 100 eV), enabling LIED to resolve the atomic positions of both light and heavy atoms in a target structure across a wide variety of \u00ea . In particular, the appreciable scattering amplitude of hydrogen obtained with LIED makes it sensitive to locating the positions of hydrogen atoms in molecules, which other techniques (e.g. UED, non-covariance/coincidence CEI) are insensitive to and instead use heavier \"tag\" atoms such as halogens (i.e. iodine, bromine) to identify the molecular structure. This is particularly significant as most molecules contain hydrogen atoms, which in fact play a pivotal role in many biological and chemical processes such as hydrogen bonding in DNA and proton motion during respiration. Two important tools are required to perform MIR-LIED measurements: (i) a femtosecond MIR laser source with a repetition rate of >100 kHz, and (ii) a particle spectrometer that can simultaneously detect electrons and ions under coincidence conditions. Fig. 4.13A shows the pulse energy as a function of repetition rate for typical laser systems, with the diagonal lines indicating the average power.

The master equation is derived for an arbitrary driving force affecting both the transition matrix element and the potential energy. For a cw electric field, the time dependent probability of staying at the product state, P1(t), is shown to be strongly dependent on the field intensity parameter a: P1(a,t) approximately (Gamma(m(1),m(2))t)(-E(rf)/E(rs)) or P1(a,t) approximately (Gamma(m(0))t)(-E(rf)/E(rs)), double or single resonances, respectively.

By changing the parameter a, one is able to manipulate the rate and direction of the reaction. When J(2)(m(0))(a) is close to zero the reaction is slow. Hence, slow modes turn out to be fast. This changes the character of the evolution dynamics from non- to mono- exponential decay, respectively. For the double resonance, the equilibrium constant is studied with the field intensity. It is shown that the reaction is almost insensitive to temperature. However, it strongly depends on the reaction heat, which provides a condition for the resonance.",

The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

In particular, these models allow the classical trajectories to be calculated and mapped to experimental features, enabling the energy and propagation times of the returning electrons to be characterized. Measurements can be performed in the quasistatic regime (i.e. \u2248 0.3) by either increasing the peak laser intensity, 3 , or using a longer driver wavelength, . Fig. 4.8A shows that at a fixed peak laser intensity, 3 , of 1 \u00d7 10 M\u00e4 Wcm -2 typically used in near-infrared (NIR) measurements, one can perform measurements deep into the quasistatic regime by using a longer driver wavelength, . Whereas increasing the peak laser intensity has the disadvantage of depleting the number of ground-state molecules before the peak of the laser pulse, which is strongly dependent on the \u00c9 of the molecule. This leads to a decrease in the number of rescattered electrons generated as a result of an increase in the direct ionization of molecules on the rising edge of the laser pulse. Thus, it is important to achieve an ionization fraction of much less than unity to have sufficient neutral target density to perform rescattering measurements. To exemplify this point, Fig. 4.8B shows the fraction of molecules ionized at the peak of a six cycle laser pulse as a function of driver wavelength for two molecules at = 0.3: (i) naphthalene with an \u00c9 of 8 eV (which is a typical \u00c9 for most relatively large organic molecules), and (ii) acetylene with an \u00c9 of 12 eV.

The laser pulse is divided with a non-polarizing beam splitter and propagates along two paths. The first path, using approximately 10% of the total power, passes through two BBO crystals to frequency triple the pulse before imaging the beam onto a photocathode to generate electrons. The remaining power (the pump pulse) is sent to a delay stage to control the timing delay between the electrons and laser pulse. The pump pulse is then reflected off a grating to tilt the intensity front. Tilting the pulse reduces the temporal blurring caused by group velocity mismatch. 31,32 The laser is introduced to the sample chamber at a 60 angle relative to electron propagation. This matches the velocity of the laser and electron beams along the direction of propagation of the electrons. Figure 2 shows how the intensity front of the electron and laser pulses point parallel to electron propagation, as well as how the pulses from each beam overlap temporally. The tilted pulse is imaged onto the gas jet where it is measured to have a 260 lm (V) \u00c2 190 lm (H) FWHM diameter and 200 fs pulse duration. The average power of the laser beam was measured to be 4.92 W just before entering the chamber.\n\n\nStructural Dynamics\n\n\nARTICLE\n\nscitation.org/journal/sdy",

In the present work, we describe the prototype setup of the electron diffractometer used in this study. At the core of the prototype diffractometer was an EIGER X 1M detector (DECTRIS Ltd), a hybrid pixel detector that is frequently used in X-ray crystallography but that is also suitable for detecting electrons (Tinti et al., 2018). This hybrid pixel detector has a negligible readout time of 3 ms, which enables shutterless, continuous data collection (Broennimann et al., 2006). It has a frame rate of up to 3 kHz, although in this study it was operated at 100 Hz. This enables fine-slicing of data (Pflugrath, 1999;Casanas et al., 2016) at a fast rotation of the sample for instruments where the beam intensity cannot be arbitrarily reduced. The sensor layer of 450 mm makes it radiation-hard at electron energies of 200 keV and makes a beam stop unnecessary (Tinti et al., 2018). The EIGER X 1M has a high count rate of 0.5 \u00c2 10 8 s \u00c01 mm \u00c02 , which was saturated only by the top 2-3 pixels of the direct beam and by none of the reflections. At 100 Hz, the dynamic range of 16 bit was well above all recorded intensities. The detector is noise-free, and only scattering inside the TEM added to the noise in the data. The prototype diffractometer also includes solutions for proper calibration of the instrument, i.e. the reliable determination of experimental parameters. This work may act as a reference for future instrument design, and aims at encouraging other research groups to determine chemical structures from submicrometresized crystals with existing TEMs before a fully integrated solution becomes available.\n\n\nMethods and materials\n\n\nInstrumentation",

This is a sufficient proportional increase to afford a reasonable test of the theory.\n\nHaving now obtained satisfactory evidence that, in the three directions where it lends itself to experimental verification, the theory of Prof. Thomson does express the experimental facts concerning the scattering of homogeneous /3-rays, we may now proceed to apply it to the determination of the number of electrons contained in an atom of the various elements concerned.\n\n\nOn the Number of Electrons in an Atom.",

Transient absorption kinetics of the hydrated electron, e(aq) (-), have been observed, from a few hundred femtoseconds out to 600 ps, and studied as function of hydroxide concentration and temperature. The geminate decay kinetics are bimodal, with a fast exponential component ( approximately 13 ps) and a slower power \"tail\" due to the diffusional escape of the electrons. For the biphotonic excitation, the extrapolated fraction of escaped electrons is 1.8 times higher than for the monophotonic 200 nm excitation (31% versus 17.5% at 25 degrees C, respectively), due to the broadening of the electron distribution. The biphotonic electron detachment is very inefficient; the corresponding absorption coefficient at 400 nm is &lt;4 cm TW(-1) M(-1) (assuming unity quantum efficiency for the photodetachment).

For specimens thicker than a few tens of nm, the image intensity and scattering contrast are likely to be higher than at lower voltage, as is the visibility of ionization edges below 1000eV (as required for EELS elemental analysis). In thick (&gt;100nm) specimens, higher voltage ensures less beam broadening and better spatial resolution for STEM imaging and EDX spectroscopy. Low-voltage (e.g. 30kV) TEM or STEM is attractive for a very thin (e.g. 10nm) specimen, as it provides higher scattering contrast and fewer problems for valence-excitation EELS. Specimens that are immune to radiolysis suffer knock-on damage at high current densities, and this form of radiation damage can be reduced or avoided by choosing a low accelerating voltage. Low-voltage STEM with an aberration-corrected objective lens (together with a high-angle dark-field detector and/or EELS) offers atomic resolution and elemental identification from very thin specimens. Conventional TEM can provide atomic resolution in low-voltage phase-contrast images but requires correction of chromatic aberration and preferably an electron-beam monochromator. Many non-conducting (e.g. organic) specimens damage easily by radiolysis and radiation damage then determines the TEM image resolution. For bright-field scattering contrast, low kV can provide slightly better dose-limited resolution if the specimen is very thin (a few nm) but considerably better resolution is possible from a thicker specimen, for which higher kV is required. Use of a phase plate in a conventional TEM offers the most dose-efficient way of achieving atomic resolution from beam-sensitive specimens. ",

Recent advances in the development of high-flux electron pulse sources with the required time resolution and sensitivity to capture barrier-crossing processes are described in the context of attaining atomic level details of such structural dynamics-seeing chemical events as they occur. Initial work focused on the ordered-to-disordered phase transition of Al under strong driving conditions for which melting takes on nm or molecular scale dimensions. This work has been extended to Au, which clearly shows a separation in time-scales for lattice heating and melting. It also demonstrates that superheated face-centred cubic (FCC) metals melt through thermal mechanisms involving homogeneous nucleation to propagate the disordering process. A new concept exploiting electron-electron correlation is introduced for pulse characterization and determination of t=0 to within 100fs as well as for spatial manipulation of the electron beam. Laser-based methods are shown to provide further improvements in time resolution with respect to pulse characterization, absolute t=0 determination, and the potential for electron acceleration to energies optimal for time-resolved diffraction.",

Electron pulse generation\n\nThe development of the electron source and the generation of ultrafast electron pulses played a vital role in the establishment of ultrafast electron diffraction and microscopy. The developments that are being carried out on the electron source focus on the enhancement of the temporal and spatial coherent resolution to capture faster dynamics of matter with higher resolution.\n\nSpatial coherence, which is defined through the maximum distance between two objects for which interference is still visible on the screen, is a critical parameter of the electron source and is determined by the transverse and longitudinal coherence lengths of the source (see Section 3). On the other hand, the temporal resolution is defined by the electron pulse duration and the phase stability at the interaction stage. Both the temporal and spatial resolutions are reduced by the space-charge effect due to Coulomb repulsion of electrons in the wave packet [114], as discussed earlier in Section 2. The electron beam intensity requirements for the source are more difficult to define, since they depend on the sample under study, namely on the phase (i.e., solid, gas), the thickness, which should be in the range of 10-100 nm, and the background. Nevertheless, at least ~ 10 4 -10 5 electrons per pulse are needed to clearly resolve the diffraction peak and/or obtain a clear image in UED and UEM, respectively [18]. From the theoretical modelling and experimental study, it is obvious that it is impossible to use the conventional electron gun parameters to attain sub-ps electron pulses at the sample position with reasonable electron number densities [114][115][116]. In the pioneering work by Siwick and Miller on implementing a compact electron gun design, 600 fs pulse durations with up to 10,000 electrons per pulse were achieved [22]. This paved the way for the development of a source of high-brightness electron beams with pulse durations on the order of hundred femtoseconds, based on Radio Frequency (RF) compression [96,102,117], which will be discussed later.\n\n\n.

This technique is the exact opposite of dispersive optics from the viewpoint of the motion of optics. Dispersive optics shows no mechanical motion during XAFS observation, which brings about high data stability and low sample generality. Successive XAFS spectra taken by dispersive optics are very stable without any energy correction in one dataset. However, dispersive optics is almost only used under transmission mode.

Gas-phase reactions such as CH + NH 3 (Tenenbaum et al. 2010) or photolysis from CH 3 NH 2 (Michael & Noyes 1963) have been proposed to explain the observed fractional abundances of methanimine. However, the formation rates are too low and alternative sources in condensed matters have been proposed, such as sequential hydrogenation of HCN on grain surfaces producing both methylamine and methanimine (Halfen et al. 2013). The potential detection of both species in this grain-free work would support the fact that there is still missing formation pathways in the gas-phase. Since ammonia has not been detected in this work, the reaction between NH 3 and CH radicals is unlikely and other bimolecular neutral-neutral reactions should be considered such as N( 2 D) + CH 4 (Yelle et al. 2010).",

Whenever available, literature values for the binding energy and geometry of dimers and trimers agree well with our data. Low lying isomers for (NH3)4 and (NH3)5 have been found to have similar binding energies (roughly 16 and 20 kcal/mol for the tetramer and pentamer, respectively), perhaps suggesting the presence of a very smooth energy landscape. Using BSSE corrected forces or freezing the monomer structure to its gas phase geometry have been found to have only a weak impact on the energetic and structural properties of the clusters. The effect of zero-point energy (ZPE) on the relative stability of the clusters has been estimated using harmonic frequencies. The latter also highlighted the presence of vibrational fingerprints for the presence of double acceptor ammonia molecules. Many-body effects for (NH3)n isomers (n = 2-4) have been investigated to explore the possibility of building a pairwise interaction model for ammonia. In the frame of the work presented, we have found the 3-body effect to account for 10-15% of the total interaction energy, whereas the 4-body effects may be neglected as first approximation.",

This paper reports (i) ab initio quantum chemical calculations on the energy paths that lead to various reaction products, (ii) calculations of the overall rate constant and branching ratios to different products using transition state and master equation methods, and (iii) an experimental determination of the H atom yield from the reaction. The ab initio calculations show that reaction occurs predominantly via the initial formation of a datively bound HC-NH(3) complex and reveal low energy pathways to three sets of reaction products: H(2)CNH + H, HCNH(2) + H, and CH(3) + NH. The transition state calculations indicate the roles of \"outer\" and \"inner\" transition states and yield rate constants between 20 and 320 K that are in moderate agreement with the experimental values. These calculations and those using the master equation approach show that the branching ratio for the most exothermic reaction, to H(2)CNH + H, is ca. 96% throughout the temperature range covered by the calculations, with those to HCNH(2) + H and CH(3) + NH being (4 \u00b1 3)% and &lt;0.3%, respectively. In the experiments, multiple photon dissociation of CHBr(3) was used to generate CH radicals and laser-induced fluorescence at 121.56 nm (VUV-LIF) was employed to observe H atoms. By comparing signals from CH + NH(3) with those from CH + CH(4), where the yield of H atoms is known to be unity, it is possible to estimate that the yield of H atoms from CH + NH(3) is equal to 0.89 \u00b1 0.07 (2\u03c3), in satisfactory agreement with the theoretical estimate.",

One-dimensional cuts of the full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) along the interatomic distances and bending angle are presented for each isomer.

Here the dynamical properties of the aromatic hydrogen bond in NH(4)(C(6)H(5))(4)B were studied by quasielastic incoherent neutron scattering in a broad temperature range (20&lt; or =T&lt; or =350 K). We show that in the temperature range from 67 to 350 K the ammonium ions perform rotational jumps around C(3) axes. The correlation time for this motion is the lifetime of the \"transient\" H bonds. It varies from 1.5 ps at T=350 K to 150 ps at T=67 K. The activation energy was found to be 3.14 kJ mol, which means only 1.05 kJ mol per single H bond for reorientations around the C(3) symmetry axis of the ammonium group. This result shows that the ammonium ions have to overcome an exceptionally low barrier to rotate and thereby break their H bonds. In addition, at temperatures above 200 K local diffusive reorientational motions of the phenyl rings, probably caused by interaction with ammonium-group reorientations, were found within the experimental observation time window. At room temperature a reorientation angle of 8.4 degrees +/-2 degrees and a correlation time of 22+/-8 ps were determined for the latter. The aromatic H bonds are extremely short lived due to the low potential barriers allowing for molecular motions with a reorientational character of the donors. The alternating rupture and formation of H bonds causes very strong damping of the librational motion of the acceptors, making the transient H bond appear rather flexible.",

In order to investigate the entrance channel, the vibronic S(1)&lt;--&gt;S(0) spectra of the 7HQ.(NH(3))(3) and the d(2)-7DQ.(ND(3))(3) clusters have been studied by resonant two-photon ionization, UV-UV depletion and fluorescence techniques, and by ab initio calculations for the ground and excited states. For both isotopomers, the low-frequency part of the S(1)&lt;--S(0) spectra is dominated by ammonia-wire deformation and stretching vibrations. Excitation of overtones or combinations of these modes above a threshold of 200-250 cm(-1) for 7HQ.(NH(3))(3) accelerates the HAT reaction by an order of magnitude or more. The d(2)-7DQ.(ND(3))(3) cluster exhibits a more gradual threshold from 300 to 650 cm(-1). For both isotopomers, intermolecular vibrational states above the threshold exhibit faster HAT rates than the intramolecular vibrations. The reactivity, isotope effects, and mode selectivity are interpreted in terms of H atom tunneling through a barrier along the O-H--&gt;NH(3) coordinate. The barrier results from a conical intersection of the optically excited (1)pi pi(*) state with an optically dark (1)pi sigma(*) state. Excitation of the ammonia-wire stretching modes decreases both the quinoline-O-H...NH(3) distance and the energetic separation between the (1)pi pi(*) and (1)pi sigma(*) states, thereby increasing the H atom tunneling rate. The intramolecular vibrations change the H bond distance and modulate the (1)pi pi(*)&lt;--&gt;(1)pi sigma(*) interaction to a much smaller extent.",

A topological analysis of the electron localization function is used to illustrate the changes in the bonding along the series. The lowest dissociation energies of NeH(3) (+) and ArH(3) (+) ( approximately 1 and approximately 7 kcalmol) correspond to the breaking of the complexes according to X+H(3) (+), while the lowest dissociation energies of KrH(3) (+) and XeH(3) (+) ( approximately 8 and approximately 3 kcalmol) correspond to the breaking according to XH(+)+H(2). Rotational constants and harmonic frequencies are reported. Apart from XeH(3) (+) whose dipole moment (mu=2.6 D) may not be large enough, all the other complexes with dipole moments in the range of 6-8 D should be reasonable targets for detection by microwave spectroscopy.

NH 3 is a polar molecule, it tightly binds to the dOH via H-bonding between the N atom and the dOH. CO 2 is an apolar species, with binding energy three times lower than that of NH 3 . This implies that NH 3 is a more effective dangling-OH band blocker over CO 2 . The reported binding energies are from Ferrero et al. (2020). The simplified geometries are an adaptation of real geometries obtained with quantum chemical calculations in Ferrero et al.

As a general rule, we can state that polar molecules, especially NH 3 and CH 3 OH, are efficient dOH blockers, whereas apolar species (e.g., CO 2 ) are not good dOH blockers, unless significantly more abundant than polar species, in agreement with the findings of Cuppen et al.

Based on the evidence that ammonia is one of the most abundant polar species of interstellar ices after H 2 O (its abundance is approximately a factor of 3 higher than that of CH 3 OH; Zanchet et al. 2013;Boogert et al. 2015), we propose that in addition to the impact of thermal annealing and energetic particles, ammonia is one of the main contributors if probably not the only one in the suppression of the 2152 cm \u22121 band, and more generally of all the dOH bands.\n\n\nOther dOH-blocker candidates",

The 2152 cm \u22121 band is the result of the interaction between absorbed CO and dangling-OH bonds (dOH) on amorphous water-ice surfaces (Sandford et al. 1988;Buch & Devlin 1991;Devlin 1992;Palumbo & Strazzulla 1992;Palumbo 1997;Collings et al. 2003a;Al-Halabi et al. 2004;Palumbo et al. 2010;He et al. 2019). This feature has been identified in laboratory CO:H 2 O ice mixtures, whereas it appears to be absent in observational spectra of interstellar ices. The question then is why CO molecules apparently do not bind to the dangling-OH site in pre-and protostellar environments, resulting in spectra lacking the 2152 cm \u22121 band.\n\nAt first, the nondetection was attributed to the low signal-tonoise ratio of observations in the 4 \u00b5m region, and thus, to the difficulties in resolving this band when the abundance of the responsible interstellar molecules is too low (e.g., Sandford et al. 1988;Ehrenfreund et al. 1997). A second explanation ascribed the nondetection to the low spectral resolution of the observations because of the overlap of several bands in the 4 \u00b5m region, such as gas-phase CO rovibrational transitions, the H 2 Pfund-\u03b2 emission line at \u223c2149 cm \u22121 , and the C\u2212N stretching mode at 2165 cm \u22121 (Schmitt et al. 1989;Schutte & Greenberg 1997;Pendleton et al. 1999;Novozamsky et al. 2001).",

We performed a systematic study of different H 2 O:NH 3 and H 2 O:CO 2 ice mixtures, using porous ASW as the main ice analog component. CO was deposited on top of both mixtures. NH 3 and CO 2 were selected because they are ubiquitous species in astrophysical environments.

This question has not yet been answered satisfactorily. To answer it, we have developed an ab initio potential energy surface (PES) for this dimer at the limits of the current computational capabilities and performed essentially exact six-dimensional calculations of the vibration-rotation-tunneling (VRT) spectra of NH<sub3</sub-NH<sub3</sub and ND<sub3</sub-ND<sub3</sub, obtaining an unprecedented agreement with experimental spectra. In agreement with other recent electronic structure calculations, the global minimum on the PES is in a substantially bent hydrogen-bonded configuration. Since the bottom of the PES is exceptionally flat, the dimer is extremely fluxional and the probability of finding it in configurations that are not hydrogen bonded is high. Nevertheless, the probability of hydrogen-bonded configurations is large enough to consider the ammonia dimer to be hydrogen bonded. We also show that NFK's inference that the ammonia dimer is nearly rigid actually results from unusual cancellations between quantum effects that generate differences in spectra of different isotopologues.",

It appears that the dihalogen molecules form the strongest halogen-bonded complexes with ammonia, followed by HOX; the charge-transfer-type contribution has been demonstrated to dominate the halogen bonding in these complexes. For the complexes involving carbon-bound halogen molecules, our calculations clearly indicate that electrostatic interactions are mainly responsible for their binding energies. Whereas the halogen-bond strength is significantly enhanced by progressive fluorine substitution, the substitution of a hydrogen atom by a methyl group in the CH(3)X...NH(3) complex weakened the halogen bonding. Moreover, remote substituent effects have also been noted in the complexes of halobenzenes with different para substituents.

Finally, some positively charged halogen-bonded systems have been investigated and the effect of the charge has been discussed.",

The observed IPD spectra display a drastic change in the vibrational band features at n = 4, indicating a sharp discontinuity in the structural evolution of the monohydrated cluster anions. The n = 2 and 3 spectra are composed of a series of sharp bands around 3600 cm(-1), which are assignable to the stretching vibrations of H2O bound to C2O4- in a double ionic hydrogen-bonding (DIHB) configuration, as was previously discussed (J. Chem. Phys. 2005, 122, 094303). In the n &gt; or = 4 spectrum, a pair of intense bands additionally appears at approximately 3300 cm(-1). With the aid of ab initio calculations at the MP2/6-31+G* level, the 3300 cm(-1) bands are assigned to the bending overtone and the hydrogen-bonded OH vibration of H2O bound to CO2- via a single O-H...O linkage. Thus, the structures of [(CO2)n(H2O)]- evolve with cluster size such that DIHB to C2O4- is favored in the smaller clusters with n = 2 and 3 whereas CO2- is preferentially stabilized via the formation of a single ionic hydrogen-bonding (SIHB) configuration in the larger clusters with n &gt; or = 4.",

In addition the vertical electron attachment, the adiabatic electron affinity, and vertical ionization energy, of the neutral clusters were calculated. Most of the predicted lowest energy structures were linear, whereas bent structures became more stable with the increase of the cluster size and increase of the number of the N atoms. In most of the predicted lowest energy structures, the N atom prefers the terminal position with acetylenic bond. The calculated BE of the predicted clusters increases with the increase of the cluster size for the neutral and cation clusters but decreases with the increase of the cluster size for the anion clusters. The predicted clusters are characterized by high HLG of about 11 eV on the average, with that of the anion clusters is smaller than that for the neutral and cation clusters.

The 26.5 eV/photon laser (pulse time duration of approximately 1 ns) is employed as a single photon ionization source for the detection of these clusters. Only a small fraction of the photon energy is deposited in the cluster for metastable dissociation of cluster ions, and most of it is removed by the ejected electron.

The hydrogen bond donors are rigidly preorganised and suitably oriented for intramolecular N-H...Cl-Cu hydrogen bonds. Cyclic voltammetry studies show that the reduction potential of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) couple as a function of the ligand follows the order TPA &lt; L(Am-n) &lt; or approximately L(Np-n) &lt; L(Piv-n), and that the magnitude of the effect increases with the number of hydrogen bonding groups. These trends could be explained in terms of the steric and electronic effects exerted by these groups stabilising the Cu(I) oxidation state. In fact, the X-ray structure of the air-stable [(L(Piv-3))Cu(I)Cl] complex is reported and shows elongated Cu-N and Cu-Cl bonds, presumably due to the combination of steric and electron withdrawing effects exerted by the three pivaloylamido groups. We reasoned that the strength of hydrogen bonding in the Cu(I) and Cu(II) oxidation states could differ and therefore contribute also to the aforementioned redox changes; this hypothesis is tested using IR and NMR spectroscopy. IR studies of the [(L(Piv-1,2,3))Cu(I)Cl] and [(L(Piv-1,2,3))Cu(II)Cl]+ complexes in acetonitrile show that the intramolecular N-H...Cl-Cu hydrogen bonding weakens in the order L(Piv-1) &gt; L(Piv-2) &gt; L(Piv-3), and that it is stronger in the Cu(I) complexes. The 1H NMR spectra of the [(L(Piv1,2,3))Cu(I)Cl] complexes are in complete agreement with the IR data, and reveal that the stability of the Cu(I) complexes to oxidation in air increases in the order L(Piv-1) &lt; L(Piv-2) &lt;&lt; L(Piv-3). The hydrogen bonds in the Cu(I) complexes are stronger because of the higher electron density on the Cl ligand, when compared to the Cu(II) complexes. This is consistent with ab initio MP2 calculations performed on the complexes [(L(Piv-3))Cu(I)Cl] and [(L(Piv-3))Cu(II)Cl]+. Thus, the electron density of a metal-bound ligand acting as hydrogen bond acceptor is revealed as the major factor in determining the strength of the hydrogen bonds formed. From the IR data the energies of the N-H...Cl-Cu hydrogen bonds is estimated, as is the contribution of changes in hydrogen bond strength with the oxidation state of the copper centre and number of interactions to stabilising the Cu(I) state. Some of the implications of this result in dioxygen activation chemistry are discussed.",

The B values obtained from the experiment are B=200.36871(18) MHz for the (187)Re isotopomer and B=200.5561(10) MHz for the (185)Re isotopomer. The measured rotational constants are in reasonably good agreement with the B values calculated from the x-ray diffraction structural data, and from theoretical calculations. The gas-phase Mn-Re bond distance is approximately 2.99 A, and the calculated value is only slightly longer. The experimental quadrupole coupling constant for the manganese atom is eQq(aa) ((55)Mn)=-16.52(5) MHz, and the corresponding quadrupole coupling constants for the two rhenium isotopomers are eQq(aa) ((187)Re)=370.4(4) MHz and eQq(aa) ((185)Re)=390.9(6) MHz. The quadrupole coupling constants were also determined from a variety of theoretical calculations, with very large Gaussian orbital bases.

The intrinsic reaction coordinate potential energy curve, reaction energetics, and transition state (TS) properties were calculated for this reaction at different levels of electronic structure theory, and MP2/6-31G( *) was chosen as a meaningful and practical method for performing the direct dynamics. The trajectories show that the HF bond, uncoupled from the other degrees of freedom, is formed within the first 10 fs as the system moves from the TS towards products. The populations of the HF vibration states, determined from the simulations, decrease monotonically as found from experiments. However, the simulation's populations for the low and high energy vibration states are larger and smaller, respectively, than the experimental results. The HF rotational temperature found from the simulations is in agreement with experiment. Increasing the TS's excess energy gives higher rotational temperatures for both C(2)H(4) and HF. Energy is partitioned to the products from both the excess energy in the TS and the potential energy release in the exit channel. Partitioning from these two energy sources is distinguished by varying the TS's excess energy. An analysis of the simulation's energy disposal shows that the fractions of the excess energy partitioned to relative translation, C(2)H(4) vibration, C(2)H(4) rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation, are 0.17, 0.64, 0.076, 0.067, and 0.046, respectively, and are in good agreement with previous simulations on empirical potentials and experiments. The partitioning found for the potential energy release is 81%, &lt;0.05%, 5%, 11%, and 3% to relative translation, C(2)H(4) vibration, C(2)H(4) rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation. This result is substantially different than the deduction from experiments, which summarizes the partitioning as 20%, 45%, 24%, and &lt;12% to relative translation, C(2)H(4) vibration+rotation, HF vibration, and HF rotation. Possible origins of the difference between the simulations and experiments in the release of the potential energy is discussed.",

CN radicals were generated by pulsed laser photolysis of NCNO at 573 nm. A fraction of the radicals was then promoted to a selected rotational level in v=2 using a tunable infrared \"pump\" laser operating at approximately 2.45 microm, and the subsequent fate of this subset of radicals was monitored using pulsed laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). Values of ktot,Ni were determined by observing the decay of the PLIF signals as the delay between pump and probe laser pulses was systematically varied. In a second series of experiments, double resonance spectra were recorded at a short delay between the pump and probe laser pulses. Analysis of these spectra yielded state-to-state rate coefficients for rotational energy transfer, ki--&gt;f. The difference between the sum of these rate coefficients, Sigmafki--&gt;f, and the value of ktot,Ni for the same level Ni is attributed to the occurrence of chemical reaction, yielding values of the rotationally selected rate coefficients (kreac,Ni) for reaction of CN from specified rotational levels. These rate coefficients decrease from (7.9+/-2.2)x10(-10) cm3molecule-1 s-1 for Ni=0 to (0.8+/-1.3)x10(-10) cm3 molecule-1 s-1 for Ni=20.

The microwave spectrum of the reaction product was observed in the frequency range from 8.0 to 40.0 GHz. The rotational constants (MHz) were determined as A = 8744.09(6), B = 4846.07(2), and C = 3177.84(3) for CH(2)&amp;dbond;C(CH(3))&amp;bond;(14)NO (normal species) and A = 8664.36(5), B = 4822.15(3), and C = 3157.04(3) for CH(2)&amp;dbond;C(CH(3))&amp;bond;(15)NO ((15)N species) in the ground vibrational state. The values of the planar moment (P(cc) = (I(a) + I(b) - I(c))/2) obtained for the normal and (15)N species were 1.525(1) and 1.526(1) u \u00c5(2), respectively. This suggests that the nitrogen atom lies in or is close to the ab inertial plane of the molecule and shows also that only two hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically out of the symmetry plane. The reaction product was determined to be syn-2-nitrosopropene by comparing the observed and calculated rotational constants, kappa (Ray's asymmetry parameter) and r(s) coordinates of the nitrogen atom. The dipole moments (D) were determined to be \u00b5(a) = 2.43(5), \u00b5(b) = 1.12(7), and \u00b5(total) = 2.67(7). The barrier heights of the internal rotation owing to the methyl group of the normal species in the ground and first excited torsional states were determined to be 1750(50) and 1740(50) cal/mol (1 cal/mol = 4.184 J/mol), respectively. The (14)N nuclear quadrupole coupling constants (MHz) were determined to be chi(aa) = 0.25(21), chi(bb) = -7.11(40), and chi(cc) = 6.85(61). Two vibrational excited states were observed and the vibrational frequencies (cm(-1)) of the C-N and C-C torsional modes were determined to be 160(40) and 175(40), respectively.

First, a normal-mode analysis according to the Ayala and Schlegel's algorithm has been used to identify the internal rotation modes of methanethiol and the transition state structure. Then, after calculation of the energy barrier for each internal rotation, the corresponding hindered rotor partition functions have been calculated following the CW scheme of Chuang and Truhlar.

The structurally similar sandwich complexes derived from closo-[3-Co(eta5-NC4H4)-1,2-C2B9H11] (1) have a different rotational habit. In 1, the cis rotamer in which the pyrrolyl nitrogen atom bisects the carboranyl cluster atoms is 3.5 kcal mol(-1) more stable in energy than the rotamer that is second lowest in energy. This cis rotamer is wide, spanning 216 degrees , and may be split into three rotamers of almost equal energy by substituting the N and the carboranyl carbon atoms adequately. To support this statement, closo-[3-Co(eta5-NC4H4)-1,2-(CH3)2-1,2-C2B9H9] (2), closo-[3-Co(eta5-NC4H4)-1,2-(mu-CH2)3-1,2-C2B9H9] 3, 2--&gt;BF3, and 3--&gt;BF3 have been prepared. Two rotamers are found at low temperature for 2--&gt;BF(3) and 3--&gt;BF3. Compounds 2, 3, and 1--&gt;BF3 behave similarly to 1. Rotational energy barriers and the relative populations of the different energy states are calculated from 1H DNMR spectroscopy (DNMR, dynamic NMR). These results agree with those of semiempirical calculations. Without exception, the cis rotamer is energetically the more stable. The fixed conformation of 1 assists in elucidating the rotational preferences of the [3,3'-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)2]- ion in the absence of steric hindrance; the [3,3'-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)2]- ion is commonly accepted to present a cisoid orientation. Complex 1 is electronically similar to the [3,3'-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)2]- ion. Both have heteroatoms in the pi ligands, and they have the same electronegativity difference between the constituent atoms. This leads to a view of the [NC4H4]- as [7,8-C2B9H11]2- ion, with no steric implications. Therefore the [3,3'-Co(1,2-C2B9H11)2]- ion should be considered to have a cisoid structure, and the different rotamers observed to be the result of steric factors and of the interaction of the counterion with either B-H groups and/or ancillary ligands. The rotamer adopted is the one with the atoms holding the negative charges furthest apart.",

The rotational state selected reactive cross sections of CH (RSSRCS-CH) turn out to depend remarkably on the rotational state distribution of O(2) molecules at a collision energy of \u223c\u20090.19 eV. The reactivity of CH molecules in the N = 1 rotational states (namely \u2223J = 1\u22152, F(2)&gt; and \u2223J = 3\u22152, F(1)&gt; states, N designates the angular momentum excluding spin) becomes strongly enhanced upon a lowering of the rotational temperature of the O(2) beam. The RSSRCS-CH in these two rotational states correlate linearly with the population of O(2) molecule in the specific K(O(2)) frame rotation number states: CH(|J = 1/2,F(2)&gt;) with O(2)(|K(O(2)) = 1&gt;);CH(|J = 3/2,F(1)&gt;) with O(2)(|K(O(2)) = 3&gt;). These linear correlations mean that the rotational-state-selected CH molecules are selectively reactive upon the incoming O(2) molecules in a specific rotational state; here, we use the term \"rotationally correlated reactivity\" to such specific reactivity depending on the combination of the rotational states between two molecular reactants. In addition, the steric asymmetry in the oriented CH (\u2223J = 1\u22152,\u2009F(2),\u2009M = 1\u22152&gt;) + O(2) (|K(O(2)) = 1&gt;) reaction turns out to be negligible (&lt; \u00b11%). This observation supports the reaction mechanism as theoretically predicted by Huang et al. [J. Phys. Chem.

They are summarised as follows:\n\u03bd O = \u03bd 0\u21921 + B 1 J (J + 1) \u2212 B 0 (J + 2)(J + 3) (26) \u03bd P = \u03bd 0\u21921 \u2212 (B 1 + B 0 )(J + 1) + (B 1 \u2212 B 0 )(J + 1) 2 (27) \u03bd Q = \u03bd 0\u21921 \u2212 J (J + 1)(B 1 \u2212 B 0 ) (28) \u03bd R = \u03bd 0\u21921 + (B 1 + B 0 )(J + 1) + (B 1 \u2212 B 0 )(J + 1) 2 (29) \u03bd S = \u03bd 0\u21921 + B 1 (J + 2)(J + 3) \u2212 B 0 J (J + 2)(30)\nWhere \u03bd 0\u21921 represents the band origin, B 0 and B 1 represent the rotational constants for their appropriate vibrational levels. As previously mentioned, for our code we use the solution calculated by TOSH (equation 8) as the band origin.",

The rotor is a complex of Re with two substituted o-phenanthrolines, one positively and one negatively charged, attached to an axial position of Rh(2)(4+) in a [2]staffanedicarboxylate grid through 2-(3-cyanobicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)malonic dialdehyde. Four regimes are characterized by a, the average lag per turn: (i) synchronous (a &lt; 1/e) at E(nu) = /E(nu)/ &gt; E(c)(nu) [E(c)(nu) is the critical field strength], (ii) asynchronous (1/e &lt; a &lt; 1) at E(c)(nu) &gt; E(nu) &gt; E(bo)(nu) &gt; kT/mu;, [E(bo)(nu) is the break-off field strength], (iii) random driven (a approximately 1) at E(bo)(nu) &gt; E(nu) &gt; kT/mu, and (iv) random thermal (a approximately 1) at kT/mu &gt; E(nu). A fifth regime, (v) strongly hindered, W &gt; kT, E(mu), (W is the rotational barrier), has not been examined. We find E(bo)(nu)/kVcm(-1) approximately (kT/(mu))/kVcm(-1) + 0.13(nu/GHz)(1.9) and E(c)(nu)/kVcm(-1) approximately (2.3kT/(mu))/kVcm(-1) + 0.87(nu/GHz)(1.6). For nu &gt; 40 GHz, the rotor behaves as a macroscopic body with a friction constant proportional to frequency, eta/eVps approximately 1.14 nu/THz, and for nu &lt; 20 GHz, it exhibits a uniquely molecular behavior.",

This molecule has been selected as a prototype for the case of a symmetric top with small ( approximately 500 kHz) torsional energy splittings in the ground torsional state (nu6 = 0). In this state, six (k +/- 3 &lt;-- k) Q-branch series have been measured for lower state K = |k| between 3 and 8 with 27 &lt;/= J &lt;/= 75. For (nu6 = 1), three series with lower state K between 5 and 7 with 49 &lt;/= J &lt;/= 66 have been observed. In two of these series, the torsional fine structure extending over approximately 6.8 MHz has been fully resolved. The (A1 - A2) splitting has been measured in the (nu6 = 0) series (K = 6 &lt;-- 3) for 37 &lt;/= J &lt;/= 74. The global data set of 443 frequencies included avoided-crossing molecular-beam splittings of Meerts and Ozier (1991. Chem. Phys. 152, 241-259) and mm-wave R-branch measurements of Bocquet et al. (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 494-499). In a weighted least-squares analysis, a good fit was obtained by varying 18 parameters in a Hamiltonian that represented both the torsional effects and the sextic splittings. Effective values have been determined for both rotational constants, eight torsional parameters including the barrier height, six diagonal centrifugal distortion constants, and two centrifugal distortion constants (epsilon and epsilonJ) that characterize the (Deltak = +/-3) matrix elements. The difficulties are discussed that arise in defining a unique model for the torsional terms in the Hamiltonian when a high barrier symmetric top is investigated by distortion moment spectroscopy. The redundancies are investigated that exist in the quartic and sextic Hamiltonian for a near-spherical top such as CH3CF3. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.",

For a favorable reaction, $\\Delta G$ has a negative value, meaning that energy is lost by the chemical system and released to the surroundings, usually as heat. Such reactions are said to be exergonic. For an unfavorable reaction, $\\Delta G$ has a positive value, meaning that energy is absorbed by the chemical system from the surroundings. Such reactions are said to be endergonic.\n\nYou might also recall from general chemistry that the standard free-energy change for a reaction is denoted as $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, where the superscript ${ }^{\\circ}$ means that the reaction is carried out under standard conditions, with pure substances in their most stable form at 1 atm pressure and a specified temperature, usually 298 K . For biological reactions, the standard free-energy change is denoted as $\\Delta G^{\\circ \\prime}$ and refers to a reaction carried out at\n$\\mathrm{pH}=7.0$ with solute concentrations of 1.0 M .\n\n\nBecause the equilibrium constant, $K_{\\text {eq }}$, and the standard free-energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, both measure whether a reaction is favorable, they are mathematically related by the equation\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}=-R T \\ln K_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad K_{\\mathrm{eq}}=e^{-\\Delta G^{\\circ} / R T}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& R=8.314 \\mathrm{~J} /(\\mathrm{K} \\cdot \\mathrm{~mol})=1.987 \\mathrm{cal} /(\\mathrm{K} \\cdot \\mathrm{~mol}) \\\\\n& T=\\text { Kelvin temperature } \\\\\n& e=2.718\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

The potential is fitted in terms of analytic functions, and the fitted potential is used to compute the lowest rovibrational states of the dimer. The quality of the PES is comparable to that of a previously published surface, which was calculated with the coupled cluster single double and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] method. It is shown that a weighted average of the DFT-SAPT and the CCSD(T) potential gives results that are in very good agreement with experimental data, for both ((12)CO)(2) and ((13)CO)(2). The relative weight was determined by adjusting the energy gap between the origins of the lowest two stacks of rotational levels of ((12)CO)(2) to the measured value.",

The latter functions evaluate the similarity transformation according to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion, including up to four nested commutators. Obviously, many of these commutators will evaluate to zero (e.g. quadruple commutators involving t2), but the work to evaluate these zeros could be avoided through the use of lower-level commands specifying the non-zero commutators, double commutators, etc. (see Table II). Equations for the doubles cluster amplitudes could be obtained in a similar way; one need only change the bra state via pq.set_left_operators(['e2(m,n,f,e)']) (see Appendix A).",

Similarly as above, first a short ab initio MD simulation was performed on a 2 x 2 x 2 supercell with CeO 1.875 composition at high temperature. This configuration was used to calculate the forces acting on the ions and these, in turn, were used for the fitting procedure. These calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [39][40][41] within the DFT+U framework. A value of U = 7 eV was chosen to ensure correct localization of the f electrons. Although this is slightly higher than is generally used 7,8 , it was found to be necessary to ensure localization in the non-equilibrium structures used in the potential fitting. We used the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Wang 91 (PW91) exchange-correlation functional and an energy cut-off of 400 eV. The Ce 3+ cations were identified as those with spin 1, while the Ce 4+ ones have no spin. The Ce 3+ and Ce 4+ cations are then treated as two different cationic species in the potential parametrization and separate terms are obtained to describe the interactions between, for instance, Ce\n4+ -O 2\u2212 and Ce 3+ -O 2\u2212 . The parameters for the Ce 4+ -O 2\u2212 and O 2\u2212 -O 2\u2212\nwere then fixed to the values obtained before for the Y doped CeO 2 system, so that these parameters are consistent and can be used all together. This procedure is equivalent to treating the Ce 3+ cations as a dopant species, in the same way as was done for Y. While an ionic model for reduced CeO 2 might not be justified a priori, the picture arising from DFT+U calculations and experiments seems to confirm this model. The f electrons are, indeed, found to be strongly localized on the Ce 3+ cations in agreement with an ionic picture.",

The aim of the study is to propose a simple method for calculating the standard oxidation potentials, and therefore, the protocol is progressively developed by adding more terms in the energy expression. In addition, the effect of including implicit solvation models (IEFPCM, CPCM, and SMD), larger basis sets, and correlation methods are investigated. The oxidation potentials calculated using the G3MP2B3 approach with IEFPCM resulted in the best fit (<iR</i<sup2</sup = 0.9624), but the slope of the correlation line, 0.74, is far from the optimal value, 1.00.

Our method can also be thought as complementary to the finite field method use in conjunction with DMC. In this method a term of the form (\u2426A) is added to the Hamiltonian and the value of \u0357A\u0358 is obtained by determining the slope of E(\u2426) computed in a series of different runs. Our method could be used to calculated all these E(\u2426) in a single run. Since the E(\u2426) are correlated, the slope of its plot as a function of \u2426, the expectation \u0357A\u0358, will be obtained more easily. If the amplitude of the operator A is small, like those we have in this work, the linear response approach most probably becomes too noise and it would be necessary to use our method. For nonlocal operators, like the kinetic energy of a component in a multicomponent system, it would be very interesting to learn if it is possible within the linear response approach of Ref. 48 to assume that the diffusion does not change for the different values of \u2426. If this is true, them always would be advantageous to use the finite field approach together with our method. The extension we have proposed to the DMC method might be very useful not only for the helium systems, but also for other quantum many-body systems where a clue is need to identify the best description between competing interacting potentials. Even if these potentials differ by very small amounts, the nature of the interactions they describe can be different. A better understanding of these differences and their relevance is important on its own and so as mean of obtain better analytical representations of the interacting potentials. The calculations of small energy contributions of spin-orbit terms in molecular physics 47 might be another situation where our method can help in better understanding a physical system.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was conducted, in part, using the facilities of the ''Centro Nacional de Processamento de Alto Desempenho em S\u00e3o Paulo.''

The agreement was found to be satisfactory for the case of the lowest \u03a3 states as seen in Fig. 1. Additionally we have compared the A 2 \u03a0 u state calculated using the same ECP+CPP method to the core-valence MRCI+Q/cc-pwCVQZ calculation using the 3s3p4s3d + 4p x space discussed above. These two calculations agree very well, as demonstrated by Fig. 1. Because of the good agreement with the all electron calculations and the computational limitations in performing multi-reference core-valence correlation calculation, we have used the ECP+CPP method to calculate the A 2 \u03a0 u state in this paper. We note in passing that the use of the CPP is essential; without it one does not obtain the correct ordering of the excited atomic asymptotes.",

The auxiliary functions \u2032 \u2032 , therefore, arising in the case of four-center electron-repulsion integrals have been studied in recently published paper[50]. It should be noted that all the one-, two-and three-center multicenter integras appearing in HFR equations can also be calculated from the formulas (4.4) and(4.5). For this purpose we must calculate one-and two-center overlap integrals of three STOs and use Eqs.(4.9), (4.13), (4.14) and (4.15). The convergence properties of the series expansion relation for three-center nuclear attraction integral obtained by the use of unsymmetrical one-range addition theorems of the Coulomb potential for \u2212 are shown in tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. These tables list the partial summations in Eq. (4.4) corresponding to progressively increasing upper summations limits denoted by , N L and M . As can be seen from tables 4.1 and 4.2, the Eq. (4.4) displays the most rapid convergence to the numerical results with twelve digits stable as a function of summation limits L and M . We see that the convergence of the series with respect to L and M is rapid; therefore, we can include only a few terms obtained from the summation over indices l and . Table 4.3 shows that the accuracy of computer calculations obtained in the present algorithm is satisfactory for m 15 N = . Greater accuracy is attainable by the use of more terms in the expansion in Eq. (4.4).",

At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed. This effect is attributed to a contribution from the radical complex mechanism as was also observed in other recombination reactions of larger radicals. Equal limiting low-pressure rate constants k(0) = [M]7 x 10(-31)(T/300 K)(-3.0) cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1) were fitted for M = Ar and N(2) whereas limiting high-pressure rate constants k(infinity) = 2.2 x 10(-12)(T/300 K)(0.9) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) were approached. These values are discussed in terms of unimolecular rate theory. It is concluded that a theoretical interpretation of the derived rate constants has to be postponed until better information of the potential energy surface is available. Preliminary theoretical evaluation suggests that there is an \"anisotropy bottleneck\" in the otherwise barrierless interaction potential between CH(3) and O(2).",

( 3), see Fig. 2. The resulting vapor pressure of the saturated solution, p sat,L (290.9K)=(2.1\u00b10.7)\u00d710\u22125 Pa, agrees within error with the one obtained for the solid particle after one day of evaporation.Thus, we conclude that the particle after efflorescence contains a substantial amount of material which evaporates at higher rate than the stable solid.For glutaric acid, we indeed have indication of aqueous inclusions from hygroscopicity cycles performed on particles in the EDB (see Fig. 5 of Zardini et al., 2008).During the main efflorescence step only a part of the water is lost.Subsequent continuous water loss over a broad RH range is observed until the hygroscopicity cycles close.Because the same initial mass is reached for several subsequent cycles we can exclude irreversible mass loss (e.g. by evaporation) as explanation for this effect.The amount of crystalline material present in the effloresced particle initially may be estimated from the extrapolation of the orange dashed line in Fig. 4 to the start of the experiment.This implies that about 60% of the mass of the solid after efflorescence were crystalline and 40% were aqueous inclusions.The implications of this observation will be discussed further below.One immediate consequence for our own measurements is that if these ratios are representa- tive also for larger particles, the time needed before measuring the relevant vapor pressure of the crystalline solid exceeded those we often used.This becomes evident when plotting our data versus temperature as shown in Fig. 5.As discussed, the solid vapor pressures at T =290.9K span a considerable",

The de Broglie wavelength is only appreciable for matter that has a very small mass and/or a very high velocity.\n\nWerner Heisenberg considered the limits of how accurately we can measure properties of an electron or other microscopic particles. He determined that there is a fundamental limit to how accurately one can measure both a particle's position and its momentum simultaneously. The more accurately we measure the momentum of a particle, the less accurately we can determine its position at that time, and vice versa. This is summed up in what we now call the Heisenberg uncertainty principle: It is fundamentally impossible to determine simultaneously and exactly both the momentum and the position of a particle. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v_{x}$ in the $x$ direction (or equivalently with momentum $p_{x}$ ), the product of the uncertainty in the position, $\\Delta x$, and the uncertainty in the momentum, $\\Delta p_{x}$, must be greater than or equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ (where $\\hbar=\\frac{h}{2 \\pi}$, the value of Planck's constant divided by $2 \\pi$ ).\n\n$$\n\\Delta x \\times \\Delta p_{x}=(\\Delta x)(m \\Delta v) \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\n$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the limit to how precisely we can know both the simultaneous position of an object and its momentum.

More sharpness in the position domain requires contributions from more frequencies in the speed domain to create the narrower curve, and vice versa. It is a fundamental tradeoff inherent in any such related or complementary measurements, but is only really noticeable at the smallest (Planck) scale, near the size of elementary particles.

In angular momentum (AM) terms, however, this recoil orbital AM (l(p)) is shown to be a critical component of the overall AM balance. For products of light mu(p), the maximum value of l(p) is energy limited and as a result the formation of products in low rotational (j(p)) states is severely restricted. Here energy constraints on recoil orbital AM and the consequent restrictions on j(p)-state populations are quantified using novel diagrammatic methods that illustrate how constraints on l(p) determine the j(p) states that are allowed or forbidden by the need to conserve energy and AM for each state-to-state transition. The method accurately predicts j(BaI)j (v=0,1,2) peaks from crossed-beam Ba + HI experiments, providing a quantitative and physically transparent rationale for the observed BaI rotational distributions. Extension to a wider range of reactions having mu(r)mu(p)&gt;1 shows that at least some j(p) are formally forbidden for each given reactant relative velocity or, more accurately, l(r). The fraction of inaccessible product states for a given initial velocity rises rapidly with mu(r)/mu(p) (&gt;96% in Ba + HI). The method is also used to demonstrate that recoil orbital AM will be strongly aligned parallel to product rotational AM for high mu(r)/mu(p), although this correlation is generally lost in the low j(p) region as the parallel vector requirement is relaxed.",

In this study, we investigate the feasibility of performing fast and continuous energy modulation within the momentum acceptance of a clinical beamline for proton therapy. The alternative use of a local beam degrader at the gantry coupling point has been compared with a more common upstream regulation. Focusing on clinically relevant parameters, a complete beam properties characterization has been carried out. In particular, the acquired empirical data allowed to model and parametrize the errors in range and beam current to deliver clinical treatment plans. For both options, the local and upstream degrader, depth-dose curves measured in water for off-momentum beams were only marginally distorted (\u03b3(1%, 1\u00a0mm)\u00a0&gt;\u00a090%) and the errors in the spot position were within the clinical tolerance, even though increasing at the boundaries of the investigated scan range. The impact on the beam size was limited for the upstream degrader, while dedicated strategies could be required to tackle the beam broadening through the local degrader. Range correction models were investigated for the upstream regulation. The impaired beam transport required a dedicated strategy for fine range control and compensation of beam intensity losses. Our current parameterization based on empirical data allowed energy modulation within acceptance with range errors (median 0.05\u00a0mm) and transmission (median -14%) compatible with clinical operation and remarkably low average 27\u00a0ms dead time for small energy changes. The technique, tested for the delivery of a skull glioma treatment, resulted in high gamma pass rates at 1%, 1\u00a0mm compared to conventional deliveries in experimental measurements with about 45% reduction of the energy switching time when regulation could be performed within acceptance. Fast energy modulation within beamline acceptance has potential for clinical applications and, when realized with an upstream degrader, does not require modification in the beamline hardware, therefore, being potentially applicable in any running facility. Centers with slow energy switching time can particularly profit from such a technique for reducing dead time during treatment delivery.",

Regarding the aim of achieving a minimal measurement uncertainty, it is unclear if one principle allows to achieve lower uncertainties or if both principles can achieve equal uncertainties. For this reason, the natural, fundamental uncertainty limit according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is derived for Doppler and time-of-flight measurement principles, respectively. The obtained limits of the velocity uncertainty are qualitatively identical showing, e.g., a direct proportionality for the absolute value of the velocity to the power of 32 and an indirect proportionality to the square root of the scattered light power. Hence, both measurement principles have identical potentials regarding the fundamental uncertainty limit due to the quantum mechanical behavior of photons. This fundamental limit can be attained (at least asymptotically) in reality either with Doppler or time-of-flight methods, because the respective Cram\u00e9r-Rao bounds for dominating photon shot noise, which is modeled as white Poissonian noise, are identical with the conclusions from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.",

The determination of the Zemach radius, (1.019+/-0.016) fm, from atomic physics tightly constrains fits to accelerator measurements of proton form factors.

Unfortunately, the main strength of the protons, their finite range, is also their greatest weakness. Any uncertainty on the range may lead to inadequate target coverage or excessive toxicity. The uncertainties have multiple origins and include, among others, ballistic errors, morphological modifications or inaccurate estimations of the physical quantities necessary to predict the proton range. Uncertainties have been part of daily practice in conventional radiotherapy with X-rays for a long time. However, dose distributions delivered with X-rays are much less sensitive to uncertainties than the ones delivered with protons. This relative insensitivity enabled the management of uncertainties through safety margins using a simple formalism. The conditions of validity of this formalism are much more restrictive for proton therapy, leading to the need of developing new tools and adapted strategies to manage accurately these uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to present a vision for the management of uncertainties in proton therapy in the continuity of formalisms established for X-rays. The latter are first summarized before discussing the necessary developments in order to consistently apply them to protons. ",

The uncertainty in our experiment is dominated by the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz, corresponding to 50 \u00b5eV 49 . In addition, there are several minor effects contributing to the uncertainty: for an LaB 6 surface ionizer, as used in this experiment, the energy spread has been determined to be of the order of 0.55 eV 51 . This implies a velocity spread of the ions which is compressed due to the acceleration over a high potential in the subsequent ion beam extraction process 52 . The compressed velocity spread of the ions is given by the expression \u2206v = \u2206W / \u221a 2mW , where m is the ion mass, \u2206W the energy spread of the ions and W the kinetic energy of the ion beam 53 . The velocity spread of the ion beam can be converted to a spread of the frequency of the laser light of \u2206\u03bd = \u2206v/\u03bb seen by the ions. This results in a frequency Doppler broadening of only a few MHz in the fast ion beam. The divergence of the ion and laser beams and the interaction time will also contribute to the broadening. However, this accumulates to uncertainties of less than 10 MHz. Consequently, the uncertainties arising from these minor effects could be ignored and only the laser bandwidth of 12 GHz needs to be considered. In addition to these statistical errors, some systematic uncertainties arise: the Doppler shift due to the velocity difference of ions and photons is very large but it can, as described above, be eliminated to all orders by performing the experiment with both co-and counter-propagating laser and ion beams and calculating the geometrical mean to determine the Doppler-free threshold. Hence, the Doppler shift does not contribute to the uncertainty of the result, barring slight potential angle misalignment of maximum 24 mrad as defined by the apertures. However, uncertainties of the ion beam energy and the wavelength calibration could potentially affect the results. Such drifts were estimated to be smaller than 20 \u00b5eV by comparing two reference scans on stable 127 I which were performed with the same setup before and after the measurements on astatine.",

Using the quantum uncertainty relation and electron mean free path, the magnitudes of uncertainties on electron position and momentum are calculated for different kinetic energies; a validity bound on the classical simulation of electron transport is derived. In order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, uncertainties of 5% must be assigned to position and momentum for 1 keV electrons in water; at 100 eV, these uncertainties are 17 to 20% and are even larger at lower energies. In gaseous media such as air, these uncertainties are much smaller (less than 1% for electrons with energy 20 eV or greater). The classical Monte Carlo transport treatment is questionable for sub-1 keV electrons in condensed water as uncertainties on position and momentum must be large (relative to electron momentum and mean free path) to satisfy the quantum uncertainty principle. Simulations which do not account for these uncertainties are not faithful representations of the physical processes, calling into question the results of MC track structure codes simulating sub-1 keV electron transport.

Due to these necessities, the NA62 experiment has constructed a detector which is approximately 270 m in length. The components of the experiment are explained briefly below, for full details see .

However, this is not required in general; for example, position information can instead be extracted at the cost of noise in momentum. Using random, partial projections in position followed by strong measurements in momentum, we efficiently determine the transverse-position and transverse-momentum distributions of an unknown optical field with a single set of measurements. The momentum distribution is directly imaged, while the position distribution is recovered using compressive sensing.

For information: Each Ag atom in the historic SGE had a mean momentum of p x = 54 a.u.. Since the mean deflection in z direction in the 3.5 cm long magnet was 0.1 mm the Ag transverse momentum was p z = 0.15 a.u.. This corresponds to a transverse kinetic energy of 1.6 \u00b7 10 \u22123 eV. Using narrower slits (e.g. 1.5 micron) and a velocity selected atomic beam the momentum resolution could be strongly improved below 0.005 a.u. corresponding to an energy change in the atom kinematics of below 10 \u22125 eV. This excellent resolution value demonstrates the great power of momentum measurements and the great breakthrough of the historic SGE in resolution. Heisenberg (1927) discussed the SGE as a benchmark example of the resolution limits in a quantum physics measurement in his famous paper on the uncertainty relation. But he considered only the energy and not the momentum measurement of the magnetic atom in the magnetic field. He concluded that the precision of the energy measurement depends on the time of flight through the magnetic field t F . The precision of momentum measurement in a single scattering event is not restricted by Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. The uncertainty relation does not affect Stern's measurement approach. Notice, though, that a direct energy measurement would never yield such a resolution.\n\nThis precisely measurable exchange of transverse momentum via the magnetic field interaction implies a reduction to a single eigenfunction (Devereux, 2015). According to (Bohm, 1951, ch. 21) one can calculate the path for a super-positioned two-spin state wave function and the super position remains until impact on the detector. But in momentum space (because of the extremely small de Broglie wave length) the two spin states after entering the magnetic field region are immediately distinguishable by their transverse momenta and follow detectable classical trajectories. This is in full agreement with Bohm's interpretation of the SGE, where he stated: \"It would be possible in principle to measure the spin by measuring the momentum transmitted to the particle by the magnetic field\" (Bohm, 1951, p. 596).",

Instead of treating state-to-state dynamics with state of the art methods, predictions are still based on: (i) simple thermodynamical arguments, (ii) crude reaction models such as H atom exchange or proton jump, or (iii) statistical considerations used for describing processes proceeding via long-lived or strongly interacting collision complexes. A central problem is to properly account for the consequences of the fact that H and D are fermions and bosons, respectively. In the experimental and results sections, it is emphasized that although a variety of innovative techniques are available and have been used for measuring rate coefficients, cross-sections or state-to-state transition probabilities, the definitive experiments are still pending. In the centre of this contribution are our activities on various m + n = 5 systems.

The RMS energy uncertainty is given by:\n\u2206E = kT 2 C v(1)\nwhere k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C v is heat capacity [1,2,3]. One can estimate the heat capacity using the equipartition theorem. By analogy to the Debye theory of heat capacity of crystals, at room temperature we can assume that most of the vibrational degrees of freedom of a large protein molecule are low frequency modes and can therefore be considered to be fully thermally active. Each oscillator will contribute to the heat capacity, and there are three oscillators per atom. If the molecule contains vibrationally active atoms the equipartition theorem [3] predicts a heat capacity of C v = 3kN . Since we are dealing with large ions we ignore the fact that there are three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, which would effectively reduce by a count of six.

Whether the same energy consideration applies to the WT channel would require a set of calculations on WT; these are left for future work. Because the single proton energy difference is very large going to the down state, we presumably must take two protons to have a realistic representation of the system (possibly a third proton should also have been included to provide adequate gating current, but we saw earlier that this may not be close to the main section of the VSD, hence would be of lesser importance.)

The essential features of the spectra are consistent with the radical pair mechanism and were satisfactorily simulated using parameters whose values are either known independently or for which estimates are readily available. The calculations included hyperfine couplings to four deuterons in the pyrene cation radical and three protons in the 1,3-dicyanobenzene anion radical.

A method to enhance the NMR signal is needed due to the low thermal polarization of nuclear spins at these fields; dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) via the Overhauser effect from free radicals is an attractive option. In this report we describe a DNP-enhanced NMR system operating at a fixed field of 1.5mT and measure (1)H signal enhancements of up to -350 fold during the saturation of a selected electron spin resonance (ESR) transition of dissolved nitroxide radicals. This -350 fold enhanced polarization is equivalent to what would be obtained by prepolarization in a 0.53T field. The ESR spectra at varying radical concentrations are indirectly found through DNP-enhanced NMR detection. Here, ESR line broadening at higher radical concentrations due to Heisenberg electron spin exchange is observed. Enhancements in the limit of maximum power are reported as a function of concentration for three ESR transitions, and are found to increase with concentration. The &gt;300 fold (1)H NMR signal amplifications achievable at 1.5mT will reduce experimental time by several orders of magnitude, permitting NMR relaxation, imaging or pulsed-field gradient diffusion experiments that are inaccessible without using the DNP effect at 1.5mT. We demonstrate the potential benefit of such large signal amplification schemes through T(1) and T(2) relaxation measurements carried out in a much shorter time when employing DNP. Finally, we compare our results to those obtained in the earth's magnetic field and find that the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of DNP-enhanced signal at 1.5mT is much greater than that obtained by previous studies utilizing DNP enhancement in the 0.05mT earth's magnetic field.",

The presence of hydrogen bonding interactions to the tyrosyl radical oxygens in ribonucleotide reductases were detected. At 285 GHz the g-value anisotropy from the rhombic type 2 Cu(II) signal in the enzyme laccase has its g-value anisotropy clearly resolved from slightly different overlapping axial species. Simple metal site systems with S&gt;1/2 undergo a zero-field splitting, which can be described by the spin Hamiltonian. From high-frequency EPR, the D values that are small compared to the frequency (high-field limit) can be determined directly by measuring the distance of the outermost signal to the center of the spectrum, which corresponds to (2 S-1)* mid R: Dmid R: For example, D values of 0.8 and 0.3 cm(-1) are observed for S=5/2 Fe(III)-EDTA and transferrin, respectively.

Singlet &lt;--&gt; triplet interconversion in [Py*- DMA*+] radical pairs is probed by investigating combinations of fully protonated and fully deuterated reaction partners. Qualitatively, the experimental B1/2 values for the four isotopomeric radical pairs agree with predictions based on the Weller equation using known hyperfine coupling constants. The amplitude of the \"low field effect\" (LFE) correlates well with the ratio of effective hyperfine couplings, aDMA/aPy. An efficient method is introduced for calculating the spin evolution of [Py*- DMA*+] radical pairs containing a total of 18 spin-1/2 and spin-1 magnetic nuclei. Quantitative analysis of the magnetic field effects to obtain the radical re-encounter probability distribution f (t )-a highly ill-posed and underdetermined problem-is achieved by means of Tikhonov and maximum entropy regularization methods. The resulting f (t ) functions are very similar for the four isotopomeric radical pairs and have significant amplitude between 2 and 10 ns after the creation of the geminate radical pair. This interval reflects the time scale of re-encounters that are crucial for generating the magnetic field effect. Computer simulations of generalized radical pairs containing six spin-1/2 nuclei show that Weller's equation holds approximately only when the radical pair recombination rate is comparable to the two effective hyperfine couplings and that a substantial LFE requires, but is not guaranteed by, the condition that the two effective hyperfine couplings differ by more than a factor of 5. In contrast, for very slow recombination, essentially any radical pair should show a significant LFE.",

The zero-field splitting parameters D for the free-base, Zn and Sn derivatives are 465 x 10(-4), 342 x 10(-4) and 353 x 10(-4) cm-1, respectively, and are temperature invariant over the temperature ranges studied.

Though the E value for Zn cytochrome c is large, the geometry of the site appears quite constrained, as indicated by a spectral line shape showing a single species. Intersystem crossing occurred predominantly to the T2 &gt; zero-field spin sublevel. EPR line shape changes with respect to temperature of Zn cyt c are interpreted in terms of vibronic coupling, and a maximum Jahn-Teller crystal-field splitting of approximately 180 cm-1 is obtained.

A housemade spin echo circuitry controlled by a microwave network analyzer, a pulse pattern generator, and an oscilloscope connects to the microstrip through a series of copper, stainless steel, and superconducting semirigid coaxial lines which are thermally anchored to the different cooling stages of the fridge by means of power attenuators, circulators, and a cryogenic amplifier.

The results show an increase in echo signal intensity as temperature is decreased until saturation as theoretically expected in reaching 99% spin polarization at 100 mK. Our technique allows tuning of the spin system in the pure-state regime and minimizing dipolar fluctuations, which are the main contribution to decoherence in solid-state samples of single-molecule magnets (SMMs) - molecular spin systems that are currently being tested for applications in quantum computation. The achievement of full spin polarization at 100 mK will allow for coherent control over the time evolution of spin systems without the need for large magnetic fields (commonly used to polarize the dipolar bath at higher temperatures) and high frequencies.",

This technique is less successfully applied to high-spin systems that have even electron configurations, e.g. Fe2+ (S = 2). The recently developed technique of high-frequency and high-field EPR (HFEPR), employing swept fields up to 25 T combined with multiple, sub-THz frequencies readily allows observation of EPR transitions in such high-spin systems. A parallel spectroscopic technique is frequency-domain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (FDMRS), in which the frequency is swept while at zero, or at discrete applied magnetic fields. We describe here the application of HFEPR and FDMRS to two simple high-spin (HS) ferrous (Fe2+) salts: ferrous perchlorate hydrate, [Fe(H2O)6](ClO4)2 and (NH4)2[Fe(H2O)6](SO4)2, historically known as ferrous ammonium sulfate. Both compounds contain hexaaquairon(II). The resulting spectra were analyzed using a spin Hamiltonian for S = 2 to yield highly accurate spin-Hamiltonian parameters. The complexes were also studied by powder DC magnetic susceptibility and zero-field M\u00f6ssbauer effect spectroscopy for corroboration of magnetic resonance results. In the case of [Fe(H2O)6](ClO4)2, all the magnetic techniques were in excellent agreement and gave as consensus values: D = 11.2(2) cm(-1), E = 0.70(1) cm(-1).

This can be traded for improved spatial resolution and combined with parallel imaging to achieve higher temporal resolution. At high field strength, the RF-wavelength and the dimension of the human body complicate the development of NMR coils. For example, at 7 T, the wavelength in free space corresponds to about 1m. The dielectric constant in tissue with a high water content can be as high as 70 and at a larmor frequency of 300 MHz, this corresponds to a wavelength inside tissue of less than 15 cm. The operating wavelength is thus comparable to the diameter of most body parts. To this end, both temporal and spatial variations of the excitation field must be taken into account in addition to the expected increase in conductivity. For all these reasons, we find the propagation of radiation at ultra high fields (&gt;4 T) new phenomena commonly observed in quantum optics but traditionally negligible in NMR such as phase modulation of the excitation field such that the identity between pulse area and flip angle is no longer valid. In this paper, the emergence of field propagation phenomena in NMR experiments is analytically and numerically demonstrated. It is shown that in addition to the well-studied dielectric resonance phenomena at high magnetic fields (&gt;4 T), field propagation effects transform the excitation pulse into an adiabatic excitation. The high field strength also mean that nonlinear effects such as self-induced transparency are now possible in NMR experiments.",

Using a bimodal cavity resonator, X-band EPR signal from Mn(III) center in the Mn(III)Mb was observed near zero-field region. The temperature dependence of this signal indicates a negative axial zero-field splitting value, D&lt;0. The EPR analysis shows that this signal is attributed to the transition between the closely spaced M(s)=+/-2 energy levels for the z-axis, corresponding to the heme normal. To determine the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters, EPR experiments on the Mn(III)Mb were performed at various temperatures for some frequencies between 30GHz and 130GHz and magnetic fields up to 14T. We observed several EPR spectra which are analyzed with a spin Hamiltonian for S=2, yielding highly accurate ZFS parameters; D=-3.79cm(-1) and |E|=0.08cm(-1) for an isotropic g=2.0. These ZFS parameters are compared with those in some Mn(III) complexes and Mn(III) superoxide dismutase (SOD), and effects on these parameters by the coordination and the symmetry of the ligands are discussed. To the best of our knowledge, these EPR spectra in the Mn(III)Mb are the very first MFEPR spectra at frequencies higher than Q-band in a metalloprotein with an integer spin.",

By comparing a conventional \u03c0-conjugated polymer as the active material to a perdeuterated analogue, we demonstrate the interplay between the zero-field feature and local hyperfine fields. The zero-field peak results from a quasistatic magnetic-field effect of the RF radiation for periods comparable to the carrier-pair lifetime. Zeeman resonances are resolved down to 3.2\u2005MHz, approximately twice the Larmor frequency of an electron in Earth's field. However, since reducing hyperfine fields sharpens the Zeeman peak at the cost of an increased zero-field peak, we suggest that this result may constitute a fundamental low-field limit of magnetic resonance in carrier-pair-based systems. OLEDs offer an alternative solid-state platform to investigate the radical-pair mechanism of magnetic-field effects in photochemical reactions, allowing models of biological magnetoreception to be tested by measuring spin decoherence directly in the time domain by pulsed experiments.",

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe possibility that the quantum dynamics of the spins in radical pairs could underlie the magnetic compass sense of migratory songbirds has attracted a great deal of recent interest. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] One indication that this might be possible is provided by the first experimental demonstration that a radical pair recombination reaction can function as a magnetoreceptor in an Earth strength magnetic field. 14-16 A carotenoidporphyrin-fullerene (CPF) molecule rapidly undergoes two successive electron transfer reactions after photoexcitation to form a long-lived C \u2022+ PF \u2022\u2212 radical pair, predominantly in its electronic singlet state, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Once the radical pair has formed, hyperfine interactions between the electron and nuclear spins in the carotenoid radical cause coherent transitions between the singlet and triplet radical pair states, a process which is also affected by the Zeeman interaction of the electron spins with an applied magnetic field. Because the singlet and triplet radical pair states decay at different rates, the time-dependent survival probability of the carotenoid C \u2022+ radical in the pair, which is detectable by transient absorption spectroscopy, [14][15][16] is also sensitive to the applied magnetic field. This sensitivity has been detected experimentally in magnetic fields as low as 39 \u00b5T, 14 and also simulated theoretically with semiclassical spin dynamics calculations. 17,18 Since the carotenoid radical contains 45 protons with significant hyperfine coupling constants, going beyond the semiclassical approximation to the spin dynamics presents a considerable challenge. The full spin system has a Hilbert space of dimension 2 47 > 10 14 , and a Liouville space of dimension 2 94 > 10 28 , which makes a naive brute force calculation of the quantum mechanical spin dynamics quite impractical. Using efficient sampling techniques, the upper limit that such a calculation can currently reach is a system with \u223c 20 coupled nuclear spins, 19,20 which is far fewer than are present in C \u2022+ PF \u2022\u2212 . A number of semiclassical methods have been developed with the aim of simulating the spin dynamics of radical pairs as complex as this, 17,21-23 but until recently it has not been possible to validate these methods by comparison with exact quantum calculations for such large spin systems.",

This model takes into account the thermal polarization along with all internal relaxation processes in a four-level system represented by the electron- and nuclear-spin relaxation times T(1e) and T(1n), respectively, and the cross-relaxation time, T(1x). It is shown that under conditions of sufficiently high thermal spin polarization, nuclei can exhibit asymmetric ENDOR spectra in two cases: the first when t(mix) &gt;&gt; T(1e) and T(1n), T(1x) &gt;&gt; T(1e), where ENDOR signals from the alpha manifold are negative and those of the beta manifold positive, and the second when the cross- and/or nuclear-relaxation times are longer than the repetition time (t(mix) &lt;&lt; T(1e) &lt;&lt; t(R) and T(1n), T(1x) &gt; t(R)). In that case the polarization of the ENDOR signals becomes opposite to the previous case, the lines in the alpha manifolds are positive, and those of the beta manifold are negative. This case is more likely to be encountered experimentally because it does not require a very long mixing time and is a consequence of the saturation of the nuclear transitions. Using this model the experimental t(mix) and t(R) dependencies of the W-band (1)H ENDOR amplitudes of [Cu(imidazole)(4)]Cl(2) were reproduced and the values of T(1e) and T(1x) &gt;&gt; T(1e) were determined. The presence of asymmetry in the ENDOR spectrum is useful as it directly provides the sign of the hyperfine coupling. The presented model allows the experimentalist to adjust experimental parameters, such as t(mix) and t(R), in order to optimize the desired appearance of the spectrum.",

Experimental and computational routes have been long pursued to understand and utilize such Stark effects. However, existing approaches are largely indirect informants on electric fields, and/or are complicated by multiple causal factors in spectroscopic change. We present a system to directly measure quadrupolar Stark effects from an applied electric (E) field. Our apparatus and applications are relevant in two contexts. Each uses a radiofrequency (rf) E field at twice the nuclear Larmor frequency (2omega(0)). The mechanism is a distortion of the E-field gradient tensor that is linear in the amplitude (E(0)) of the rf E field. The first uses 2omega(0) excitation of double-quantum transitions for times similar to T(1) (the longitudinal spin relaxation time). This perturbs the steady state distribution of spin population. Nonlinear analysis versus E(0) can be used to determine the Stark response rate. The second context uses POWER (perturbations observed with enhanced resolution) NMR. Here, coherent, short-time (&lt;&lt;T(2), the transverse relaxation rate) excitation at 2omega(0) is synchronized with an NMR multiple-pulse line-narrowing sequence. Linear analysis of the Stark response is then possible: a quadrupolar multiplet with splitting proportional to E(0). The POWER sequence converts the 2omega(0) interaction from off-diagonal/nonsecular to the familiar diagonal form (I(z)(2)) of static quadrupole interactions. Meanwhile, background contributions to line width are averaged to zero, providing orders-of-magnitude resolution enhancement for correspondingly high sensitivity to the Stark effect. Using GaAs as a test case with well-defined Stark response, we provide the first demonstration of the 2omega(0) effect at high-field (14.1 T) and room temperature. This, along with the simplicity of our apparatus and spectral approach, may facilitate extensions to a wider array of material and molecular systems. The POWER context, which has not previously been tested, is detailed here with new design insights. Several key aspects are demonstrated here, while complete implementation is to be presented at a later time. At present, we (1) account for finite pulse times in pulse sequence design, (2) demonstrate two-channel phase coherence for magnetic (omega(0)) and electric (2omega(0)) excitation, and (3) provide line narrowing by a factor of 10(3). In addition, we find that certain anomalous contributions to the line shape, observed in previous low-field (250 mT) applications, are absent here.",

HFEPR is defined as frequencies above ~100\u00a0GHz (i.e., above W-band) and a resonant field reaching 25\u00a0T and above. The ability of HFEPR to provide high-resolution determination of g values of S\u00a0=\u00a01/2 is shown; however, the main aim of the minireview is to demonstrate how HFEPR can extract spin Hamiltonian parameters [zero-field splitting (zfs) and g values] for species with S\u00a0&gt;\u00a01/2 with an accuracy and precision unrivalled by other physical methods. Background theory on the nature of zfs in S\u00a0=\u00a01, 3/2, 2, and 5/2 systems is presented, along with selected examples of HFEPR spectroscopy of each that are relevant to bioinorganic chemistry. The minireview also provides some suggestions of specific systems in bioinorganic chemistry where HFEPR could be rewardingly applied, in the hope of inspiring workers in this area. ",

This occurs both by distortion of the zfs tensor due to intermolecular collisions and, for complexes with less than cubic symmetry, by reorientational modulation of the permanent zfs tensor. The reorientational mechanism is much less well characterized in previous work than the distortional mechanism although it is an important determinant of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) paramagnetic relaxation enhancement phenomena (i.e., the enhancement of NMR relaxation rates produced by paramagnetic ions in solution or NMR-PRE). The classical density matrix theory of spin relaxation does not provide an appropriate description of the reorientational mechanism at low Zeeman field strengths because the zero-order spin wave functions are stochastic functions of time. Using spin dynamics simulation techniques, the time correlation functions of the spin operators have been computed and used to determine decay times for the reorientational relaxation mechanism for S=1. In the zfs limit of laboratory field strengths (H(Zeem)&lt;&lt;H(zfs) (composite function)), when the zfs tensor is cylindrical, the spin decay is exponential, the spin relaxation time, tau(S) (composite function) approximately 0.53tau(R)((1)), where tau(R)((1)) is the reorientational correlation time of a molecule-fixed vector. The value of tau(S) (composite function) is independent of the magnitude of the cylindrical zfs parameter (D), but it depends strongly on low symmetry zfs terms (the E/D ratio). Other spin dynamics (SD) simulations examined spin decay in the intermediate regime of field strengths where H(Zeem) approximately H(zfs) (composite function), and in the vicinity of the Zeeman limit. The results demonstrate that the reorientational electron spin relaxation mechanism is often significant when H(zfs) (composite function)&gt; or =H(Zeem), and that its neglect can lead to serious errors in the interpretation of NMR-PRE data.",

The experimental relaxation rates reveal an unusual signature, in being dominated by the electron spin-rotation interaction in the MuCO radical that is formed in the addition step. In N2 moderator, k0 = 1.2+/-0.1 x 10(-34) cm(6) s(-1), only about 30% higher than found in Ar or He. The experimental results are compared with theoretical calculations carried out on the Werner-Keller-Schinke (WKS) surface [Keller et al., J. Chem. Phys. 105, 4983 (1996)], within the framework of the isolated resonance model (IRM). The positions and lifetimes of resonance states are obtained by solving the complex Hamiltonian for the nonrotating MuCO system, using an L2 method, with an absorbing potential in the asymptotic region. Accurate values of the vibrational bound and resonance states of MuCO reveal unprecedented isotope effects in comparisons with HCO, due to the remarkable effect of replacing H by the very light Mu atom (m(Mu) approximately (1/9)m(H)). Due to its pronounced zero-point energy shift, there are only two (J = 0) bound states in MuCO. Contributions from nonzero J states to the termolecular rate constants are evaluated through the J-shifting approximation, with rotational constants evaluated at the potential minimum. The value of the important A constant (181 cm(-1)) used in this approximation was supported by accurate J = K = 1 calculations, from which A = 180 cm(-1) was obtained by numerical evaluation. The calculations presented here, with a \"weak collision factor\" beta c = 0.001, indicative of the very sparse density of MuCO states, give a very good account of both the magnitude and pressure dependence of the experimental rates, but only when the fact that the two initially bound (J = 0) states become resonances for J &gt; 0 is taken into account. This is the first time in IRM calculations of atom-molecule recombination reactions where J not equal to 0 states have proven to be so important, thus providing a truly unique test of quantum rate theory.",

This induced field opposes the applied field in the middle of the ring but reinforces the applied field outside the ring (FIGURE 15.14). Aromatic protons therefore experience an effective magnetic field greater than the applied field and come into resonance at a lower applied field.\n\n\nFIGURE 15.14 The origin of aromatic ring-current. Aromatic protons are deshielded by the induced magnetic field caused by delocalized $\\pi$ electrons circulating around the aromatic ring.\nNote that the aromatic ring-current produces different effects inside and outside the ring. If a ring were large enough to have both \"inside\" and \"outside\" protons, the protons on the outside would be deshielded and absorb\nat a field lower than normal but those on the inside would be shielded and absorb at a field higher than normal. This prediction has been strikingly confirmed by studies on [18]annulene, an $18-\\pi$-electron cyclic conjugated polyene that contains a H\u00fcckel number of electrons $(4 n+2=18$ when $n=4)$. The six inside protons of [18]annulene are strongly shielded by the aromatic ring-current and absorb at $-3.0 \\delta$ (that is, 3.0 ppm upfield from TMS, off the normal chart), while the 12 outside protons are strongly deshielded and absorb in the typical aromatic region at 9.3 ppm downfield from TMS.\n\n\n[18]Annulene\n\n$$\n\\text { Inside } \\mathrm{H}:-3.0 \\delta\n$$",

This molecule has been selected as a prototype for the case of a symmetric top with small ( approximately 500 kHz) torsional energy splittings in the ground torsional state (nu6 = 0). In this state, six (k +/- 3 &lt;-- k) Q-branch series have been measured for lower state K = |k| between 3 and 8 with 27 &lt;/= J &lt;/= 75. For (nu6 = 1), three series with lower state K between 5 and 7 with 49 &lt;/= J &lt;/= 66 have been observed. In two of these series, the torsional fine structure extending over approximately 6.8 MHz has been fully resolved. The (A1 - A2) splitting has been measured in the (nu6 = 0) series (K = 6 &lt;-- 3) for 37 &lt;/= J &lt;/= 74. The global data set of 443 frequencies included avoided-crossing molecular-beam splittings of Meerts and Ozier (1991. Chem. Phys. 152, 241-259) and mm-wave R-branch measurements of Bocquet et al. (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 494-499). In a weighted least-squares analysis, a good fit was obtained by varying 18 parameters in a Hamiltonian that represented both the torsional effects and the sextic splittings. Effective values have been determined for both rotational constants, eight torsional parameters including the barrier height, six diagonal centrifugal distortion constants, and two centrifugal distortion constants (epsilon and epsilonJ) that characterize the (Deltak = +/-3) matrix elements. The difficulties are discussed that arise in defining a unique model for the torsional terms in the Hamiltonian when a high barrier symmetric top is investigated by distortion moment spectroscopy. The redundancies are investigated that exist in the quartic and sextic Hamiltonian for a near-spherical top such as CH3CF3. Copyright 1998 Academic Press.",

On the other hand, lifetimes of most micellar radical pairs are on the same order as this 'maximum limit', so that those lifetimes seem to be long enough for observation of LFEs.This paradox has not frequently been mentioned in previous studies but indicates severe effect of spin relaxations.In the report on TMDPO in the SDS micelle [31], we tried a simulation based on the Liouville equation, but the LFE is overestimated even if the microsecond-order conventional spin relaxations (deriving from anisotropic HF interactions) [60] were taken into account.It turned out that the LFE is dramatically quenched by fast spin dephasing processes of 10 8 \u221210 9 s \u22121 , which damps coherences between the sin-glet-triplet and triplet-triplet states (ST and TT dephasings) as\n\u02c6 dephasing = \u2212k STD Ms=\u22121,0,+1 \u00d7 {|ST Ms ST Ms | + |T Ms S T Ms S|} \u2212 k TTD Ms=\u22121,+1 {|T 0 T Ms T 0 T Ms | +|T Ms T 0 T Ms T 0 |}(16)\nwhere k STD and k TTD are the rate constants for ST and TT dephasing, respectively [61,62].",

Consequently, we can safely assert that neglecting the Gd isotopes in line shape studies is not a significant source of error as long as the apparent peak-to-peak width is greater than 10-20 G. This is generally the case, except at very high EPR frequencies (&gt;150 GHz).

An estimate of the upper bound of U f can be found by noting that the spreading velocity is bounded by the potential energy of the plume, i.e., the potential energy is converted only to kinetic energy of plume spread.

Multiplying this forcing function by the atmosphere's surface air temperature response function, which has recently been determined by three independent experimental analyses to have a mean global value of 0.113 K per watt per square meter, yields a value of &lt;/= 0.26 K for the resultant change in the mean global surface air temperature. This result is about one order of magnitude less than those obtained from most theoretical numerical models, but it is virtually identical to the result of a fourth experimental approach to the problem described by Newell and Dopplick. There thus appears to be a major discrepancy between current theory and experiment relative to the effects of carbon dioxide on climate. Until this discrepancy is resolved, we should not be too quick to limit our options in the selection of future energy alternatives.",

The escape velocity from Earth's surface is about 11 200 m/s, and is irrespective of the direction of the object. This makes \"escape velocity\" somewhat of a misnomer, as the more correct term would be \"escape speed\": any object attaining a velocity of that magnitude, irrespective of atmosphere, will leave the vicinity of the base body as long as it doesn't intersect with something in its path. Relative velocity Relative velocity is a measurement of velocity between two objects as determined in a single coordinate system. Relative velocity is fundamental in both classical and modern physics, since many systems in physics deal with the relative motion of two or more particles. In Newtonian mechanics, the relative velocity is independent of the chosen inertial reference frame. This is not the case anymore with special relativity in which velocities depend on the choice of reference frame.",

An estimate of the upper bound of U f can be found by noting that the spreading velocity is bounded by the potential energy of the plume, i.e., the potential energy is converted only to kinetic energy of plume spread. Therefore, the spreading velocity is approximated with (Webber et al., 1992a) \nU f \u00bc min K f \u00f0gD0H\u00de 1=2 ; \u00f03gDH\u00de 1=2 ;(7)\nwhere K f \u00bc 1.05 is the densimetric Froude number, obtained by fitting the modelled plume spread with the Thorney Island experiments.

Multiplying this forcing function by the atmosphere's surface air temperature response function, which has recently been determined by three independent experimental analyses to have a mean global value of 0.113 K per watt per square meter, yields a value of &lt;/= 0.26 K for the resultant change in the mean global surface air temperature. This result is about one order of magnitude less than those obtained from most theoretical numerical models, but it is virtually identical to the result of a fourth experimental approach to the problem described by Newell and Dopplick. There thus appears to be a major discrepancy between current theory and experiment relative to the effects of carbon dioxide on climate. Until this discrepancy is resolved, we should not be too quick to limit our options in the selection of future energy alternatives.",

Relative velocity Relative velocity is a measurement of velocity between two objects as determined in a single coordinate system. Relative velocity is fundamental in both classical and modern physics, since many systems in physics deal with the relative motion of two or more particles. In Newtonian mechanics, the relative velocity is independent of the chosen inertial reference frame.

It is therefore not at all surprising that ocular tissues are also more vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) and light damage than the skin. For this reason, humans have evolved with certain anatomical, physiological, and behavioral traits that protect this critical organ from the UV damage that would otherwise be certain from the intense bath of overhead solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) when we are outdoors during daylight. For example, the UV exposure threshold dose for photokeratitis (\"welders' flash\" or \"snow blindness\")--if measured as falling on a horizontal ground surface--would be reached in less than 10 minutes around midday in the summer sun. There are three critical ocular structures that could be affected by UV exposure: the cornea, the lens, and the retina. The cornea transmits radiant energy only at 295 nm and above. The crystalline lens absorbs almost all incident energy to wavelengths of nearly 400 nm. In youth, a very small amount of UV-A reaches the retina, but the lens becomes more absorbing with age. Thus there are intraocular filters that effectively filter different parts of the UV spectrum and allow only of the order of 1% or less to actually reach the retina. Nevertheless, this small fraction of energy--if phototoxic--could still be of concern. Finally, oblique rays entering the eye from the temporal side, can actually reach the equatorial (germinative) area of the lens.",

The first aim was to demonstrate that spectral lens transmittance in children can be measured in vivo with a Purkinje image-based system. The second aim was to test the hypothesis that the magnitude of melatonin suppression in children is enhanced by larger pupils and higher lens transmittance of short wavelengths. Fourteen healthy children and 14 healthy adults participated in this study. The experiment was conducted for two nights in our laboratory. On the first night, the participants spent time under dim light conditions (&lt;10 lux) until one hour after their habitual bedtime (BT+1.0). On the second night, the participants spent time under dim light conditions until 30\u00a0min before their habitual bedtime (BT-0.5). They were then exposed to LED light for 90\u00a0min up to BT+1.0. Individual pupil sizes were measured between BT and BT+1.0 for both conditions. Lens transmittance spectra were measured in vivo using the Purkinje image-based system during the daytime. Non-visual photoreception was calculated from lens transmittance and pupil size. This was taken as an index of the influence of age-related ocular changes on the non-visual photopigment melanopsin. Measured lens transmittance in children was found to be higher than for adults, especially in the short wavelength region (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001). Pupil size in children was significantly larger than that of adults under both dim (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and light (p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.001) conditions. Children's non-visual photoreception was 1.48 times greater than that of adults, which was very similar to the finding that melatonin suppression was 1.52 times greater in children (n\u00a0=\u00a09) than adults (n\u00a0=\u00a09).

It is the purpose of this review to discuss how these insights can be applied to understanding the slit lamp image. The slit lamp image mainly results from back scattering, whereas the effects on vision result mainly from forward scatter. Forward scatter originates from particles of about wavelength size distributed throughout the lens. Most of the slit lamp image originates from small particle scatter (Rayleigh scatter). For a population of middle aged lenses it will be shown that both these scatter components remove around 10% of the light from the direct beam. For slit lamp observation close to the reflection angles, zones of discontinuity (Wasserspalten) at anterior and posterior parts of the lens show up as rough surface reflections. All these light scatter effects increase with age, but the correlations with age, and also between the different components, are weak. For retro-illumination imaging it will be argued that the density or opacity seen in areas of cortical or posterior subcapsular cataract show up because of light scattering, not because of light loss. NOTES: (1) Light scatter must not be confused with aberrations. Light penetrating the eye is divided into two parts: a relatively small part is scattered, and removed from the direct beam. Most of the light is not scattered, but continues as the direct beam. This non-scattered part is the basis for functional imaging, but its quality is under the control of aberrations. Aberrations deflect light mainly over small angles (&lt;1\u00b0), whereas light scatter is important because of the straylight effects over large angles (&gt;1\u00b0), causing problems like glare and hazy vision. (2) The slit lamp image in older lenses and nuclear cataract is strongly influenced by absorption. However, this effect is greatly exaggerated by the light path lengths concerned. This obviates proper judgement of the functional importance of absorption, and hinders the appreciation of the Rayleigh nature of what is seen in the slit lamp image.",

The a-wave component of the ERG in response to the initial flash provided a well established measure of the activation phase of the rod response. The amplitude of the a-wave response to an intense second flash (45,000 R*) delivered 0.2-5 seconds (s) after the first flash was used to reconstruct the recovery phase of the response. For 160-3000 R* rod-1, recovery curves were isomorphic, translating on the time axis such that each e-fold increase in R* produced an incremental recovery delay of tau c = 210 +/- 50 ms (mean +/- SD). For initial flashes producing &gt; 3000 R*, recovery curves lost their initial isomorphism and half-times had intensity dependence exceeding 1 s per e-fold increase in R*.

Two extant and non-mutually exclusive hypotheses are discussed that can account for the sharp increase in recovery times from flashes producing &gt; 3000 R*.

A quantitative assessment of functionality of the melanopsin-signaling pathway could be highly relevant in order to mechanistically understand individual differences in the effects of light on these regulatory systems. We here propose and validate a reliable quantification of the melanopsin-dependent Post-Illumination Pupil Response (PIPR) after blue light, and evaluated its sensitivity to dark adaptation, time of day, body posture, and light exposure history. Pupil diameter of the left eye was continuously measured during a series of light exposures to the right eye, of which the pupil was dilated using tropicamide 0.5%. The light exposure paradigm consisted of the following five consecutive blocks of five minutes: baseline dark; monochromatic red light (peak wavelength: 630\u00a0nm, luminance: 375\u00a0cd/m(2)) to maximize the effect of subsequent blue light; dark; monochromatic blue light (peak wavelength: 470\u00a0nm, luminance: 375\u00a0cd/m(2)); and post-blue dark. PIPR was quantified as the difference between baseline dark pupil diameter and post-blue dark pupil diameter (PIPR-mm). In addition, a relative PIPR was calculated by dividing PIPR by baseline pupil diameter (PIPR-%). In total 54 PIPR assessments were obtained in 25 healthy young adults (10 males, mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 26.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0\u00a0yr).

In the presence of considerable between-subject differences, both outcome parameters had very high test-retest reliability: Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.90 and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.85. In 12 of the 25 participants (6 males, mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 26.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0yr) we examined the potential confounding effects of dark adaptation, time of the day (morning vs. afternoon), body posture (upright vs. supine position), and 24-h environmental light history on the PIPR assessment. Mixed effect regression models were used to analyze these possible confounders. A supine position caused larger PIPR-mm (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u00a0mm, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and PIPR-% (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a04.34%, SE\u00a0=\u00a01.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), which was due to an increase in baseline dark pupil diameter; this finding is of relevance for studies requiring a supine posture, as in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, constant routine protocols, and bed-ridden patients. There were no effects of dark adaptation, time of day, and light history. In conclusion, the presented method provides a reliable and robust assessment of the PIPR to allow for studies on individual differences in melanopsin-based phototransduction and effects of interventions.

Direct imaging of exoplanets allows access to a parameter space complementary to other detection methods, and potentially the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres and surfaces. However achieving the required levels of performance with direct imaging from ground-based telescopes (subject to Earth's turbulent atmosphere) has been extremely challenging. Here we demonstrate a new generation of photonic pupil-remapping devices which build upon the Dragonfly instrument, a high contrast waveguide-based interferometer. This new generation overcomes problems caused by interference from unguided light and low throughput. Closure phase measurement scatter of only \u223c 0.2\u00b0 has been achieved, with waveguide throughputs of &gt; 70%. This translates to a maximum contrast-ratio sensitivity between star and planet at 1\u03bb/D (1\u03c3 detection) of 5.3 \u00d7 10(-4) (with a conventional adaptive-optics system) or 1.8 \u00d7 10(-4) (with 'extreme-AO'), improving even further when random error is minimized by averaging over multiple exposures. This is an order of magnitude beyond conventional pupil-segmenting interferometry techniques (such as aperture masking), allowing a previously inaccessible part of the star to planet contrast-separation parameter space to be explored.",

Nevertheless, in this range, the shortest possible wavelength facilitates signal detection. The aim of this study was, thus, to determine the maximal irradiance tolerated with 6 wavelengths: 2 red, 2 far red, and 1 near infrared lights to determine the shortest wavelength well tolerated by patients, in comparison with the standard cobalt blue light of ophthalmology slitlamp. An interventional, monocentric, single-group assignment study was conducted on 30 eyes of 30 patients with infectious keratitis. Thanks to a customized machine, the photophobic eye was exposed to the 6 lights with increasing intensity. The patients switched off the light when the discomfort was too elevated. The maximal cumulative irradiance possible at 482, 650, 675, 700, 750, and 800 nm were 171, 689, 759, 862, 920, and 889 mW/cm, respectively. The maximal cumulative irradiance tolerated by patients increased significantly with wavelength (P &lt; 0.001), but the difference was not significant between each increment: red at 675 nm gave a significantly higher cumulative irradiance than blue at 482 nm; red at 700 nm did not provide significant gain compared with 675 nm; and far red at 750 nm still provided additional gain compared with 700 nm, but no significant gain was observed between 750 and 800 nm. The shortest wavelengths were stopped more quickly, and more than 50% of patients reached the maximum irradiance delivered by the source at 750 and 800 nm. We demonstrate that a light source at 750 and 800 nm can be used for ophthalmic imaging with good tolerance in photophobic patients. NCT03586505.",

IOS imaging in isolated brain slices measured at an infrared wavelength (&gt;700 nm) has recently been attributed to the changes in light scattering and transmittance due to aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-dependent astrocytic swelling. The complexity of functional interactions between neurons and astrocytes, however, has prevented the elucidation of the series of molecular mechanisms leading to the generation of IOS. Here, we pharmacologically dissected the IOS in the acutely prepared brain slices of the stratum radiatum of the hippocampus, induced by 1 s/20 Hz electrical stimulation of Schaffer-collateral pathway with simultaneous measurement of the activity of the neuronal population by field potential recordings. We found that 55% of IOSs peak upon stimulation and originate from postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptors. The remaining originated from presynaptic action potentials and vesicle fusion. Mechanistically, the elevated extracellular glutamate and K<sup+</sup during synaptic transmission were taken up by astrocytes via a glutamate transporter and quinine-sensitive K2P channel, followed by an influx of water via AQP-4. We also found that the decay of IOS is mediated by the DCPIB- and NPPB-sensitive anion channels in astrocytes. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the functional coupling between synaptic activity and astrocytic transient volume change during excitatory synaptic transmission is the major source of IOS.",

Each mechanism shows an insensitivity to the direction of retinal incidence of short-wave backgrounds not previously described. The spectral densities of the centre-most part of the lens and of the macular pigment were measured on this eye. With reasonable assumptions the former allowed for correction at the receptor level of the directional sensitivity; together with the latter it allowed correction for the spectral sensitivity as well. No correction for the attenuation of the high spatial frequencies of the background as it traversed the pupil at different r was needed. The anomalies of section 2 (above) disappear after correction for losses in the eye media. After these corrections, for every mu and r, the results are well described by the parabola 'tentatively' suggested by Stiles (1939) for each mechanism, allowing only a small amount of variance attributable to experimental imprecision alone. Each mechanism is most sensitive to backgrounds going through essentially the same point of the pupil, independent of background. This result is inconsistent with a qualitative explanation of the 'hue shift' suggested by Safir, Hyams &amp; Philpot (1971). The field sensitivity spectra for backgrounds traversing the pupil at this most effective point and at the 3.5 mm margin, are the data needed to predict this observer's brightness and colour matches of monochromatic lights passing through the entrance pupil at these two points according to a unified theory of the two Stiles-Crawford effects.

The onset of nonlinear absorption sets in at approximately an excitation fraction of 30% (consistent with the estimated number of photons per retinal in the supplemental material). If one looks at the signal level at 180 GW/cm^2, the highest excitation done for the laser power dependence, the signal is approximately the same as at 30 GW/cm^2 and a factor of 50% less than at 60 GW/cm^2. The signal should have been at least as large as the signal at 60 GW/cm^2 which would be the saturation excitation. This single measurement definitely shows that there are other processes occurring that are depleting the 1-photon channel for absorption. The amount of cis photoproduct is going down not up in relation to other excitation channels. This measurement was done at 180 GW/cm^2, which is a factor 3 less than the peak power used for the time resolved x-ray studies. If the nonlinear multiphoton process is being dominated by 2-photon processes, then the fraction of retinal excited by 2-photon processes would be 10x larger than the maximum peak power done in the laser titration.

It is shown that n (which describes the shape of the MTF) remains relatively constant at about 0.9 for field angles out to 40 deg but fc (which defines the spatial frequency scaling) declines steeply over this range, depending upon the pupil diameter and conditions of focus. The oblique astigmatism of the eye plays a major role in the off-axis changes in fc at field angles &gt; or = 20 deg. The approximation may be useful in allowing the form of the degraded optical stimulus in studies of the peripheral retinal function to be evaluated.",

The peculiar nature of HD 44179, its location within an optically thick disk, and its uncertain distance make it difficult to estimate the total visual attenuation of its light as seen from Earth. Here we adopt the latest model (Men'shchikov et al. 2002) which assigns a distance of 710 pc and a total luminosity of 6050 L \u2299 to the central object, with uncertainties of 10 % and 20 %, respectively. Given a visual brightness of V = 8.83 (Cohen et al. 1975), we then estimate a visual attenuation of A V = 4.2 mag. Here, we deliberately distinguish between attenuation and extinction. By extinction we understand the partial obscuration of direct star light due to absorption and scattering by dust along the direct line-ofsight to the star, while attenuation measures the reduction of observable flux due to absorption and scattering in a complex geometry, where the residual observable flux may indeed only be scattered light re-directed into the line of sight while the direct light is totally absorbed, as is the case in the RR.",

The objective of this article is to establish the extent to which vision is either rod-or cone-dominated under night driving conditions. Visual thresholds are measured under lighting conditions that simulate urban lighting. Dark adaptation curves are obtained under three ambient lighting conditions ranging from low (0.1 cd/m) to high (5 cd/m) mesopic levels of retinal adaptation using circular discs of different sizes (1 degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees, and 5 degrees) presented at retinal eccentricities of 0 degrees, 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 30 degrees, and 40 degrees. The dark adaptation curves exhibit the classic inflection point between rod and cone activity for the lower levels of ambient illumination but a simple monophasic function for the high mesopic levels (&gt;0.5 lux). Adaptation rates are four times faster for the higher compared with the lower illumination level and twice as fast for central compared with peripheral presentation. The data suggest that vision is mediated by cone pathways at 5 lux and by rod pathways at 0.5/0.1 lux. This shift does not profoundly affect sensitivity, but because rod pathways are known to be slower than cone pathways, it will certainly affect observers' ability to respond to rapidly changing viewing conditions such as are encountered when driving at night.",

Whilst the underlying causes are not always clear, reduction in retinal image quality is often attributed to structural changes in the posterior myopic eye. Forward light scatter, originating principally from the cornea and lens, is known to produce veiling glare which subsequently reduces retinal image contrast. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether forward light scatter varies with refractive error. Thirteen young-adult subjects (18-25\u00a0years), with mean spherical errors (MSE \u00b1 sd, D) RE, -\u20091.69\u2009\u00b1\u20092.02 (range 0.38 to -\u20094.75); LE, -\u20091.91\u2009\u00b1\u20091.94 (range 0.50 to -\u20094.63) underwent binocular assessment of forward light scatter using the AVOT light scatter test. Five glare annuli, with effective eccentricities ranging from 2 to 10\u00b0, were used to estimate parameters, k and n, which define the light scatter function of the eye. These were then used to calculate the area under the light scatter function (k') and the total volume of light scatter (k\u2033). Significant correlation was found between increasing myopia and k' values (RE, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05; r\u2009=\u20090.64; LE, p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05, r\u2009=\u20090.66).

Axial length was also not correlated with any of the light scatter parameters measured. The preliminary data from this study provide evidence that some light scatter parameters may be correlated with refractive error. Further studies are needed to characterize how changes in the anterior media of the eye, and inclusion of a wider range of refractive errors, may affect forward light scatter.",

Visual field extent (Goldmann bowl) and temporal and inferotemporal meridian sensitivities (Octopus perimeter) were measured. A wide-angle model was constructed to quantify the impact of the annular opacity on retinal illuminance. All 10 subjects observed a dark crescent in the far temporal and inferotemporal fields.

Rhodopsin has been measured by Rushton's method of reflexion densitometry in a retinal region 18 degrees temporal to the fovea, using a wavelength of measuring light (555 nm) so far into the long wave part of the spectrum that possible blue absorbing intermediates (e.g. transient orange) do not interfere.2. Rhodopsin was bleached by a strong light for 10 sec and then held steady by a weaker light. During a 10 sec bleach, no regeneration occurs and the rate of bleaching is proportional to the quantum catch. The proportionality constant is about 10(-7) (td sec)(-1).3. From 2, the rate of photolysis at equilibrium produced by the steady light was calculated. Since conditions were at equilibrium, photolysis matched regeneration. It was found that the rate of generation was proportional to the amount of pigment still bleached. The proportionality constant was about 0.0025 sec(-1).4. It was found by several different methods that the constant in 3 is the same in the light or dark and hence regeneration occurs independently of bleaching.5. Therefore, the results from bleaching and regeneration experiments can be combined to give the general equation [Formula: see text], where p is the fraction of rhodopsin, t is time in sec and I is the retinal illuminance.6. This equation describes the results of partial bleaching and regeneration experiments under a variety of different exposure intensities of moderately long (at least 10 min) exposure durations.7. The dark adaptation curve in a peripheral region of the rod monochromat's retina where there are few cones follows a simple exponential course over nearly 7 log(10) units. Rhodopsin regeneration and log threshold for this region are described by the same curve with a time constant of about 400 sec. Each log unit fal in threshold is accompanied by 0.835% increase in rhodopsin. This time constant is in agreement with Rushton's (1961) finding, but appreciably longer than that reported by Ripps &amp; Weale (1969a).8. The Ripps &amp; Weale result was, however, obtained by bleaching with a very short bright xenon flash (as they did). Under these conditions, blue absorbing intermediate(s) is (are) formed, the time constant of regeneration of rhodopsin is much faster than after long tungsten bleaches, and the kinetic equation is not valid.9. The general equation, together with the relation found in 7, successfully accounts for results previously published by others of the effect of duration and intensity of bleaching on the recovery of rod threshold in the dark, provided only that more than 5% of the rhodopsin was bleached at the beginning of dark adaptation.",

Thirty enucleated porcine eyes were prepared with a tumour phantom made by injecting a suspension of gelatine, titanium dioxide and human blood into the suprachoroidal space. The blood concentrations used were 2.5%, 25% and 50%, with 10 eyes in each group.

The first method was based on the comparison of the effects of quantal and added spatial noise on grating contrast sensitivity at each spatial frequency. The rationale behind the comparison is the fact that quantal noise is not affected by the OMTF of the human eye, because individual quanta cannot be blurred by the point spread function of ocular optics. In the second method we measured spatial contrast sensitivity for gratings whose area decreased but illuminance increased in proportion to spatial frequency squared. For such gratings the variation of contrast sensitivity with spatial frequency (f &gt; or = 0.5 c/deg) is solely due to the OMTF of the human eye, because the effects of grating area and retinal illuminance (quantal noise) on contrast sensitivity are independent of spatial frequency. The two methods provided identical OMTFs. The foveal optical modulation transfer function of the human eye for an 8 mm pupil was found to be OMTF = [1 + (f/11.1)2.5]-1, where f refers to spatial frequency in c/deg. The equation means that the OMTF is constant at low spatial frequencies, becomes reduced to 50% at 11.1 c/deg and decreases thereafter with a slope of -2.5 when plotted in double logarithmic coordinates. At 1-16 c/deg our OMTF showed less image degradation than any foveal OMTF of the human eye for 6-8 mm pupils reported so far in the literature.",

Cataracts have been observed in experimental animals when one eye was exposed to a localized, very high RF field and the other eye was the unexposed control. The results show that 2450 MHz exposures for &gt;or=30 min at power densities causing extremely high dose rates (&gt;or=150 W/kg) and temperatures (&gt;or=41 degrees C) in or near the lens caused cataracts in the rabbit eye. However, cataracts were not observed in the monkey eye exposed to similar exposure conditions, reflecting the different patterns of energy absorption (SAR, specific absorption rate) distribution, due to their different facial structure. Since the monkey head is similar in structure to the human head, the nonhuman primate study showed that the incident power density levels causing cataracts in rabbits and other laboratory animals cannot be directly extrapolated to primates, including human beings. It is reasonable to assume that an SAR that would induce temperatures &gt;or=41 degrees C in or near the lens in the human eye would produce cataracts by the same mechanism (heating) that caused cataracts in the rabbit lens; however, such an exposure would greatly exceed the currently allowable limits for human exposure and would be expected to cause unacceptable effects in other parts of the eye and face. Other ocular effects including corneal lesions, retinal effects, and changes in vascular permeability, have been observed after localized exposure of the eye of laboratory animals to both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave (PW) exposures, but the inconsistencies in these results, the failure to independently confirm corneal lesions after CW exposure, the failure to independently confirm retinal effects after PW exposure, and the absence of functional changes in vision are reasons why these ocular effects are not useful in defining an adverse effect level for RF exposure. While cataracts develop after localized exposure of the eye at SARs &gt;or= 150 W/kg, whole body exposure at much lower levels (14-42 W/kg) is lethal to rabbits. Two studies reported cataracts in this animal after 30 daily exposures at SARs at the upper end of the lethal range, e.g., 38-42 W/kg; however, long term exposure of rabbits (23 h/day, 6 months) at 1.5 W/kg (17 W/kg in the rabbit head) did not cause cataracts or other ocular effects. A long term (1-4 years) investigation of monkeys exposed at high SARs (20 and 40 W/kg to the monkey face) found no cataracts or other ocular effects or change in visual capability. The results of these long term studies support the conclusion that clinically significant ocular effects, including cataracts, have not been confirmed in human populations exposed for long periods of time to low level RF energy. The results of four recent human studies show that there is no clear evidence of an association between RF exposure and ocular cancer.",

The typical disability glare is known to result from retinal straylight. In this study, the effects of pupil diameter and, especially in the case of small pupils, of eye wall translucency on the amount of retinal straylight were investigated. Straylight was measured as a function of pupil diameter ranging from 1.3 to &gt;8 mm in five normal subjects by using a white-light, CRT-based system for scattering angles of 3.5 degrees , 7 degrees , and 14 degrees . In the study of red-free light, a yellow-LED based system was used with the same five subjects for scattering angles of 3.5 degrees , 10 degrees , and 28 degrees . Data were analyzed to assess effects of (1) inhomogeneity of light-scattering over the pupil plane, (2) translucency of the eye wall, and (3) effects of the periphery of the lens. To estimate the order of magnitude of pupil contraction in the typical glare situation, pupil reflexes resulting from the sudden appearance of headlight-equivalent bright lights were recorded in three subjects in a laboratory environment. For natural pupils (between 2 and 7 mm diameter), straylight weakly depends on pupil diameter (within 0.2 log units). For large scatter angles and small pupil diameters, eye wall translucency contributes significantly to straylight in a wavelength- and pigmentation-dependent manner. Pupil diameters decreased to photopic values under typical night-driving glare conditions. In normal eyes, straylight values measured with photopic pupils are by approximation also valid for mesopic and scotopic pupils, such as in night driving. Measurement of straylight under large angle and small pupil conditions can be used for quantitative assessment of eye wall translucency.",

Due to age related factors in the eye, particularly, structural changes of the lens, less light reaches retina. The aim of this study was to examine how age and in vivo measured lens transmission of blue light might affect pupil light responses, in particular, mediated by the ipRGC. Consensual pupil responses were explored in 44 healthy subjects aged between 26 and 68 years. A pupil response was recorded to a continuous 20 s light stimulus of 660 nm (red) or 470 nm (blue) both at 300 cd/m2 intensity (14.9 and 14.8 log photons/cm2/s, respectively). Additional recordings were performed using four 470 nm stimulus intensities of 3, 30, 100 and 300 cd/m2. The baseline pupil size was measured in darkness and results were adjusted for the baseline pupil and gender. The main outcome parameters were maximal and sustained pupil contraction amplitudes and the postillumination response assessed as area under the curve (AUC) over two time-windows: early (0-10 s after light termination) and late (10-30 s after light termination). Lens transmission was measured with an ocular fluorometer. The sustained pupil contraction and the early poststimulus AUC correlated positively with age (p=0.02, p=0.0014, respectively) for the blue light stimulus condition only.The maximal pupil contraction amplitude did not correlate to age either for bright blue or red light stimulus conditions.Lens transmission decreased linearly with age (p&lt;0.0001). The pupil response was stable or increased with decreasing transmission, though only significantly for the early poststimulus AUC to 300 cd/m2 light (p=0.02). Age did not reduce, but rather enhance pupil responses mediated by ipRGC. The age related decrease of blue light transmission led to similar results, however, the effect of age was greater on these pupil responses than that of the lens transmission. Thus there must be other age related factors such as lens scatter and/or adaptive processes influencing the ipRGC mediated pupil response enhancement observed with advancing age.",

Increasing background luminance by 0.50 log units (80\u00a0cd\u00b7m(-2), N\u00a0=\u00a04) resulted in implicit time normalization but not V (max) amplitude. Rod V (max) was decreased by 7% in NDE (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05) and sensitivity reduced by 0.40 log units (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.0001), but our data suggest that the luminance may have not been sufficient to reach V (max) in all participants in the NDE and that the sensitivity change may have been due to an inadequate inter-stimulus interval. For the photopic ERG, increasing flash luminance is not sufficient to compensate for the smaller pupil size, whereas for the scotopic ERG, more data are needed to establish proper inter-stimulus interval to perform recordings in a non-pharmacologically dilated.",

Imaging fundus reflectometry was used to measure the macular pigment distribution in human eyes with a modified fundus camera to which a cooled CCD camera was attached. The fundus images were taken at 460 nm and 560 nm after the retina was light-adapted to completely bleach rhodopsin. The density of macular pigment was estimated using a model described in the text. The variation in density with retinal eccentricity was fit to Gaussian distribution. The width of MP in retinal eccentricity was estimated by 95% covering area of the distribution profile. A total of 54 normal people served as subjects. They were divided into three groups with ages of 24.8 +/- 2.6 years (N = 24), 40.2 +/- 8.3 years (N = 13) and 67.5 +/- 7.1 years (N = 17) respectively. Statistical t-tests were employed to evaluate the differences in MP density, the half width of MP distributed (HWMPD) in retina with respect to age between the groups. Linear regression was also applied to reveal the relationships of HWMPD distribution with respect to age. The results indicate that the average MP densities are 0.23 +/- 0.08, 0.22 +/- 0.06 and 0.23 +/- 0.06 density unit (DU) for the young to old age groups. The average MP density is 0.23 +/- 0.07. No statistical significant difference is found in the peak MP density between the groups (all p &gt; 0.05). This result pretty agrees with the data that obtained from others by using optical methods. For the young to old age groups, the average estimated HWMPD are 2.6 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees, 3.1 degrees +/- 0.5 degrees and 4.1 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees respectively. The differences between loci of HWMPD in the three groups are statistically significant with p = 0.0059, p &lt; 0.0001 and p = 0.0001 for young vs. mid-age, young vs. old and mid-age vs. old respectively. Linear regressions for the HWMPD vs. age (r = 0.734, p &lt; 0.001) implies that the macular pigment can gradually accumulate and spread out to the periphery of retina through our life span with an increase rate of approximately 0.03 degrees /year. The accumulation of MP is reflected by the broader area in the macula lutea due to age, but no significant change is observed in peak density. The cause of the extension in the macular area with respect to age is unknown.",

Two-photon ionization of xenon, where one of the photons is 118 nm and the other is a 355 nm photon, is likely the mechanism producing xenon ions. The intensity of the 355 nm light is much larger than that of the third harmonic, so we can assume the absorption of the 118 nm light is the rate limiting step. We model this process as two-photon, two-color ionization model where the absorption of the 118 nm photon is far from resonance and is affected by the pressure in the gas cell due to pressure broadening. This pressure broadened absorption is the proposed mechanism for loss of 118 nm light in the detection region for high cell pressures. In Xenon the two lines closest to resonance with the 118 nm light are the Xe ( 2 P 3/2 )5d 3 2 line at 119.2 nm and the Xe ( 2 P 3/2 )7s line at 117 nm. We also must consider the Kr ( 2 P 1/2 )5d 1 2 resonance line at 116.5 nm, which can lead to additional absorption in the case of phase matching with Kr.

The energy of the rays was measured by their heating effect. They obtained for the energy necessary to make an ion the value 19*6 x 10-11 erg. This value is probably too high, for according to Barkla a large amount of energy is dissipated in the form of scattered radiation.\n\nA gas at a high temperature undergoes considerable ionisation. Equilibrium is reached when the number of ions formed is equal to the number lost by recombination. The thermodynamics of such a process, which has been worked out by Gibbs and others, gives an equation connecting the work of dissociation or ionisation with other known quantities. This relation has been used by H. A. Wilson^ to determine the energy of ionisation from by the Cathode Rays eje measurements of the conductivity of a gas. He obtained the value 2'8 x 10-12 erg in this way.\n\nTownsend,* in his experiments on ionisation by collision, was able to determine from the electric field applied the velocity of the electron when it produced an ion by collision. This velocity he found to be 2*7 x 10? cm. per sec. He thus obtained the value 2*3 x 10-11 erg as the energy necessary to produce an ion. This velocity is of the same order as the thermal velocity of agitation of an electron at a temperature of the order of 1000\u00b0 C. Possibly at high temperatures the free ions in m atter might produce fresh ions merely by their velocity of agitation.\n\nStark found from other data the value 5*1 x 10-11 erg, while Langevin gives the value 10*1 x 10\" 11 erg.\n\nR utherfordf has determined the energy necessary to make an ion by the a-particle. Knowing the heating effect of a gramme of radium and the number of a-particles ejected, the kinetic energy of an a-particle was calculated to be 4 7 x 10~6 erg. Now 48 per cent, of the kinetic energy is spent on ionisation, and since an a-particle produces about ^6,000 ions, the energy necessary to make an ion becomes 2-7 x 10\" 11 erg.",

The first ionization energy for oxygen is slightly less than that for nitrogen, despite the trend in increasing $I E_{1}$ values across a period. Looking at the orbital diagram of oxygen, we can see that removing one electron will eliminate the electron-electron repulsion caused by pairing the electrons in the $2 p$ orbital and will result in a half-filled orbital (which is energetically favorable). Analogous changes occur in succeeding periods (note the dip for sulfur after phosphorus in Figure 3.34).\n\n\nRemoving an electron from a cation is more difficult than removing an electron from a neutral atom because of the greater electrostatic attraction to the cation. Likewise, removing an electron from a cation with a higher positive charge is more difficult than removing an electron from an ion with a lower charge. Thus, successive ionization energies for one element always increase. As seen in Table 3.3, there is a large increase in the ionization energies for each element. This jump corresponds to removal of the core electrons, which are harder to remove than the valence electrons. For example, Sc and Ga both have three valence electrons, so the rapid increase in ionization energy occurs after the third ionization.\n\nSuccessive Ionization Energies for Selected Elements (kJ/mol)",

The most common decay (99.57%) is by emission of a beta particle and formation of the stable isotope 85 Rb. The emitted beta particles have a maximum energy of 687 keV and an average energy of 251 keV. We will use the average energy for our calculations. Krypton-85 has the advantage that it is an inert gas. Therefore it is used in many applications, e.g. in leak detection [39] or as a small admixture to argon as an ignition aid for high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps [40].\n\nWe use a mixture of 9.9 ppb (parts per billion) of 85 Kr in pure nitrogen. Details of the impurities in this mixture as specified by the gas supplier are given in table 1. This mixture has a specified decay rate of 500 Bq cm \u22123 (=500 kBq l \u22121 ) at standard temperature and pressure, or about 13.5 nCi cm 3 (nCi = nanocurie = 37 decays per second). In our vessel with a volume of about 100 L, this leads to about 5 \u00d7 10 7 decays per second at atmospheric pressure. The average time between decays is 20 ns which means that during a streamer discharge of 100 ns-1 \u00b5s duration 5-50 decays will take place in our gas volume.\n\nAccording to an empirical formula by Glendenin [41,42], the penetration length of a 251 keV beta particle in air at atmospheric pressure is about 50 cm which is nearly equal to the dimensions of our vacuum vessel. The average path length before an emitted particle hits the wall is about 25 cm. Therefore we assume that only half of the energy of the particle is absorbed inside the gas.\n\nWhen we assume that half of the energy loss of the particle inside the gas is used to ionize molecular nitrogen (ionization energy 15.6 eV), we can estimate the electronion pair production at about 4000 pairs per emitted beta particle.",

An equilibrium temperature of 157\u00b0 C. was thereby attained. Oxygen enclosed in its container at the same pressure was then admitted to the reaction vessel, the heating current being maintained constant. At the low pressure at which we were working the mixing of the hydrogen and oxygen was complete after a few seconds. The resulting mixture contained 1 molecule of oxygen to 10 molecules of hydrogen, and the total pressure was, of course, the same as the original common pressure of the unmixed hydrogen and oxygen. The admission of the oxygen caused the temperature of the wire, as measured by its electrical resistance, to fall im mediately to 128\u00b0 C. As combination of the gases occurs at this temperature there was thereafter a gradual fall in pressure and a consequent rise in tem pera ture.* In a second experiment conducted in the same manner with a current of 1*0 ampere the temperature fall was from 119\u00b0 C. to 98\u00b0 C., but in this case no combination of the gases could be measured. Now the sudden fall in temperature of the wire observed immediately after the admission of the oxygen to the reaction chamber could not have been due to the replacement of hydrogen molecules by an equal number of oxygen molecules since oxygen removes less heat from a hot surface than hydrogen at the same pressure. In fact, when the wire was heated by a current of 1-1 amperes in oxygen at a pressure of 48810 X 10\" 6 mm., its equilibrium temperature was as high as 167\u00b0 C.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Define and explain effusion and diffusion\n- State Graham's law and use it to compute relevant gas properties\n\nIf you have ever been in a room when a piping hot pizza was delivered, you have been made aware of the fact that gaseous molecules can quickly spread throughout a room, as evidenced by the pleasant aroma that soon reaches your nose. Although gaseous molecules travel at tremendous speeds (hundreds of meters per second), they collide with other gaseous molecules and travel in many different directions before reaching the desired target. At room temperature, a gaseous molecule will experience billions of collisions per second. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The mean free path increases with decreasing pressure; in general, the mean free path for a gaseous molecule will be hundreds of times the diameter of the molecule\n\nIn general, we know that when a sample of gas is introduced to one part of a closed container, its molecules very quickly disperse throughout the container; this process by which molecules disperse in space in response to differences in concentration is called diffusion (shown in Figure 8.27). The gaseous atoms or molecules are, of course, unaware of any concentration gradient, they simply move randomly-regions of higher concentration have more particles than regions of lower concentrations, and so a net movement of species from high to low concentration areas takes place. In a closed environment, diffusion will ultimately result in equal concentrations of gas throughout, as depicted in Figure 8.27. The gaseous atoms and molecules continue to move, but since their concentrations are the same in both bulbs, the rates of transfer between the bulbs are equal (no net transfer of molecules occurs).\n\n\nFIGURE 8.27 (a) Two gases, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_{2}$, are initially separated.

Embolism formation involves the gradual buildup of bubble pressure (air) to atmospheric pressure as demanded by Henry's law of equilibrium between gaseous and liquid phases. However, the tempo of pressure increase has not been quantified. In this report, we show that the rate of pressurization of embolized vessels is controlled by both fast and slow kinetics, where both tempos are controlled by diffusion but over different spatial scales. The fast tempo involves a localized diffusion from endogenous sources: over a distance of about 0.05 mm from water-filled wood to the nearest embolized vessels; this process, in theory, should take &lt;2 min. The slow tempo involves diffusion of air from exogenous sources (outside the stem). The latter diffusion process is slower because of the increased distance of diffusion of up to 4 mm. Radial diffusion models and experimental measurements both confirm that the average time constant is &gt;17 h, with complete equilibrium requiring 1 to 2 d. The implications of these timescales for the standard methods of measuring percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity are discussed in theory and deserve more research in future. ",

Therefore convection in the PFC layer resulting from the oscillatory motions of the alveolar sac during ventilation can significantly affect gas transport. For example, a typical value of the P\u00e9clet number in air ventilation is Pe approximately 0.01, whereas in PLV it is Pe approximately 20. To study the importance of convection, a single terminal alveolar sac is modeled as an oscillating spherical shell with gas, PFC, tissue and capillary blood compartments. Differential equations describing mass conservation within each compartment are derived and solved to obtain time periodic partial pressures. Significant partial pressure gradients in the PFC layer and partial pressure differences between the capillary and gas compartments (P(C)-Pg) are found to exist. Because Pe&gt;&gt; 1, temporal phase differences are found to exist between P(C)-Pg and the ventilatory cycle that cannot be adequately described by existing non-convective models of gas exchange in PLV The mass transfer rate is nearly constant throughout the breath when Pe&gt;&gt;1, but when Pe&lt;&lt;1 nearly 100% of the transport occurs during inspiration. A range of respiratory rates (RR), including those relevant to high frequency oscillation (HFO) +PLV, tidal volumes (V(T)) and perfusion rates are studied to determine the effect of heterogeneous distributions of ventilation and perfusion on gas exchange. The largest changes in P(C)O2 and P(C)CO2 occur at normal and low perfusion rates respectively as RR and V(T) are varied. At a given ventilation rate, a low RR-high V(T) combination results in higher P(C)O2, lower P(C)CO2 and lower (P(C)-Pg) than a high RR-low V(T) one.",

The plots n the lowwavenumber region [Fig. 2(b)] are linear. The peak wavenumbers rise as the temperature drops, simply because the force constants grow as the intermolecular distance is reduced[23]. By contrast, the torsional band \u03c4(CO2-) of the CO2-unit displays the more structured behavior inFig. 2(c): (i) predominantly linear for temperatures between 165 and 285 K, and (ii) exponential for temperatures below than 161 K.

At 100 K electron temperature, the rate constants overlap with the exception of the third vibrational level. At and above 300 K, the rate constants for excited vibrational levels are significantly smaller than that for the ground level. It is shown that any experimentally determined total rate constant at 300 K electron temperature that is smaller than 2.0 \u00d7 10(-7) cm(3)/s is likely to be for ions that have a substantially excited vibrational population. Using the vibrational level specific rate constants, the total rate constant is in very good agreement with that for an excited vibrational distribution found in a storage ring experiment. It is also shown that a prior analysis of a laser induced fluorescence experiment is quantitatively flawed due to the need to account for reactions with unknown rate constants. Two prior calculations of the dissociative recombination rate constant are shown to be inconsistent with the cross sections upon which they are based.

The thermodynamic properties of heat capability (Cp), entropy (S) and enthalpy (H) for 5B3N2C are also dictated by temperature dependence. Up to the decomposition point of the studied compound, the thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity, entropy, and enthalpy were computed. The melting point is 101-109 C, so that the 5B3N2C is unstable at 1000K. the thermodynamic properties are therefore measured at 500K. The Perl THERMO.PL [53] script has been used and is tabulated in Table 10. It is identified that, with temperatures varying from 100 to 500K, these thermodynamic functions are increasing due to the fact molecular vibrational intensities increase with the temperature. The association with temperature changes between heat capability, entropy, and enthalpy is a built-in quadratic formula. For these thermodynamic properties, the fitting factors (R 2 ) are respectively. The appropriate fitting Eqs. (II, III, IV) are as follows, and Figure 14 demonstrates the accepted statistical graphs [54].

The table and figure reveal that although our results and those of of Sidhu et al agree very well at temperatures below 1200 K, they differ significantly at high temperatures and the deviation increases as the temperature rises. This can be explained by the fact that ST1 contains more energy levels which contribute increasingly at high temperatures. We therefore expect our partition function to be the more reliable one for T > 1200 K.\n\nUsing a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear curve-fitting routine, we fitted the ST1 partition function curve to a fifth order polynomial\nz(T ) = 5 i=0 aiT i(4)\nin temperature and obtained the following coefficients for T in K: \n\nThis polynomial is not shown on Figure 1 because it is virtually identical to the ST1 curve.  \n\n\nCooling Function\n\nST1 was also used to compute the cooling function of H2D + as a function of temperature.

Table 7 shows the final values of Q obtained for selected temperature alongside their estimated degree of convergence.As can be seen, the value of Q = 7908.906at T = 298.15K calculated from UYT2 is in agreement with the value of Q = 7908.266obtained from UYT.\n\nFor the purposes of determining completeness of the line list, it is more appropriate to view the convergence of Q as a function of an energy cut-off, Emax.This is also shown in Figure 4, from where it is clear from that imposing this limit will have a non-negligible effect on a spectral simulation at T = 773.15K, in particular; since the partition function is not fully converged at Emax = 4000 cm \u22121 it is expected that levels with energies above this value will also be populated to some extent.This would be manifest as certain lines being missing from the spectrum, where transitions from levels contributing with some significance to the partition function are not included.Similarly, the truncation of calculations at J = 130 means that a number of potentially contributing energy levels are omitted from the partition sum at T = 773.15K; at J = 130 the lowest energy lies around 4000 cm \u22121 .This means that the high-T partition function obtained will be slightly lower than the fully converged value.\n\nIt is possible to quantify the completeness of the line list by assuming that the value of Q at J = 130 is close enough to the 'true' value of the partition function at the given temperature.Figure 5 shows the ratio of the value of the partition function at the 4000 cm \u22121 cut-off and the assumed total partition function, Q Total .At T = 773.15K, the line list is roughly 90% complete.In reality, this is an upper limit due to the fact that there is a slight underestimation of Q Total at this temperature.However, the contribution from the missing energies with J > 130, which all lie above 4000 cm \u22121 , can be estimated to be small enough not to affect Q Total by more than 1% below T = 800 K.\n\n\nINTENSITY COMPARISONS",

(2015). In Tab. 7, the values of the harmonic approximation for the vibrational partition function Q harm vib (T ) and the internal partition function Q rv (T ) (A1) for the main isotopologue are given. Q harm vib (T ) is calculated using the experimental fundamental vibrational energies taken from Perrin et al. (2003Perrin et al. ( , 2006 and the rotational partition function is computed from the JPL rotational energies predicted up to J=99 and K a =25 (Pickett et al. 1998). The uncertainties of the rovibrational partition function (Carvajal et al. 2019) are obtained considering the uncertainties of all the rotational energies provided in the JPL database (Pickett et al. 1998) and the experimental uncertainties of the vibrational fundamental energies (Perrin et al. 2003(Perrin et al. , 2006. These values are compared with those from CDMS catalog (Endres et al. 2016) and from Al-Refaie et al. (2015). According to the relative differences between the approximated internal partition function (A1) and the one calculated more thoroughly (Al-Refaie et al. 2015), the two results are comparable in the temperature interval from 2.725 K and 500 K. However, the difference with the values provided in the CDMS catalog is of -8.8% at 500 K and of -0.72% at 300 K. Therefore, as the approximation (A1) using a harmonic vibrational partition function is acceptable for the interval of temperature typical for the ISM and improves notably the values of JPL and CDMS catalogs for higher temperatures, this is going to be used for the other isotopologues of formaldehyde.",

The relationships between Raman peak position and H<sub2</sub density have been recorded in several previous studies. However, systematic discrepancies exist among these studies. In this study, the Raman spectral parameters (peak position, width, and intensity) of the vibrational bands of H<sub2</sub (Q<sub1</sub(0), Q<sub1</sub(1), Q<sub1</sub(2), and Q<sub1</sub(3)) were systematically measured at temperatures from 25 to 400\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures up to 150\u00a0MPa using a high-pressure optical cell. The variation in each parameter as a function of H<sub2</sub density was discussed. Several calibration polynomials derived from the measured peak positions and peak widths of these vibrational bands and the peak intensity ratios of Q<sub1</sub(1) to Q<sub1</sub(<in</i = 0, 2, 3) were established to determine H<sub2</sub densities up to 0.062\u00a0g/cm<sup3</sup at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. For natural fluid inclusions, the peak position of the Q<sub1</sub(1) band is the best choice for density determination mainly because (i) Raman spectra derived from fluid inclusions are not always of applicable qualities and the strongest intensity Q<sub1</sub(1) band could be obtained easier than others, and (ii) the peak position is insensitive to instrumental factors. The relationship between the peak position of Q<sub1</sub(1) band and density can be represented by \u0394Q<sub1</sub(1) = 90,246.070 \u00d7 \u03c1<sup4</sup - 5471.203 \u00d7 \u03c1<sup3</sup + 770.944 \u00d7 \u03c1<sup2</sup- 41.038 \u00d7 \u03c1 (r<sup2</sup = 0.999), where \u03c1 is the density of H<sub2</sub in g/cm<sup3</sup; \u0394Q<sub1</sub(1) (cm<sup-1</sup) is the difference between the obtained peak position of Q<sub1</sub(1) band of H<sub2</sub and the known peak position of Q<sub1</sub(1) band of H<sub2</sub at near-zero density. This polynomial is independent of instrumental factors and can be applied in any laboratory, as long as the peak position of H<sub2</sub with a near-zero density is known. The effects of temperature on the relationship between these spectral parameters and H<sub2</sub density were also examined.",

We generated spectra from ST1 using the Spectra-BT2 code, which is described by Barber et al (2006) and is a modified version of the original spectra code of Tennyson et al (1993). Figure 3 (a) shows a temperature-dependent H2D + absorbtion spectrum for the region largely associated with pure rotational transitions, while Figures 3 (b), (c) and (d) show the corresponding spectrum for the vibrational region.

The tests performed on the line list suggest that, although it is based entirely on ab initio quantum mechanics, it should be accurate enough for almost all astronomical purposes.

Rotational distributions of CsH products obtained for v\" = 0 and 1 states appear to be monomodal , peaking in J = 6-8. The rotational population profile is roughly consistent with a statistical distribution at the system temperature.

On the other hand, presenting strong vibration-rotation bands in the 9 \u03bcm atmospheric window, it is a greenhouse gas which contributes to global warming. In the present work, the vibrational and ro-vibrational properties of CH(2)F(2), providing basic data for its atmospheric modeling, are studied in detail by coupling medium resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to high-level electronic structure ab initio calculations. Experimentally a full quantum assignment and accurate integrated absorption cross sections are obtained up to 5000 cm(-1). Ab initio calculations are carried out by using CCSD(T) theory and large basis sets of either the correlation consistent or atomic natural orbital hierarchies. By using vibrational perturbation theory to second order a complete set of vibrational and ro-vibrational parameters is derived from the ab initio quartic anharmonic force fields, which well compares with the spectroscopic constants retrieved experimentally. An excellent agreement between theory and experiment is achieved for vibrational energy levels and integrated absorption cross sections: transition frequencies up to four quanta of vibrational excitation are reproduced with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 7 cm(-1) while intensities are predicted within few km mol(-1) from the experiment. Basis set performances and core correlation effects are discussed throughout the paper. Particular attention is focused in the understanding of the anharmonic couplings which rule the vibrational dynamics of the |\u03bd(1)&gt;, |2\u03bd(8)&gt;, |2\u03bd(2)&gt; three levels interacting system. The reliability of the potential energy and dipole moment surfaces in reproducing the vibrational eigenvalues and intensities as well as in modeling the vibrational and ro-vibrational mixings over the whole 400-5000 cm(-1) region is also demonstrated by spectacular spectral simulations carried out by using the ro-vibrational Hamiltonian constants, and the relevant coupling terms, obtained from the perturbation treatment of the ab initio anharmonic force field.

As in Tab. 7, the values of the calculated partition function are compared with those available in CDMS database (Endres et al. 2016). For the case of H 13 2 CO, the values and the uncertainties of Q rv (T ) are computed using experimental fundamental vibrational energies (Ng & Tan 2017;Wohar & Jagodzinski 1991) for the harmonic partition function and rotational energies up to J=99 and K a =25 taken from JPL database (Pickett et al. 1998). The highest relative difference between this work and CDMS values is of -0.76% at T=300 K. Therefore, at this temperature is not relevant to incorporate the vibrational contribution to the partition function. Nevertheless, the vibrational contribution is important at T=500 K increasing the rotational partition function about 9%. For the isotopologue H 2 C 18 O only the values of the rotational partition function are evinced in Tab. 8. These values and their uncertainties have been calculated using the CDMS rotational data (up to J=54, K a =16) complemented with those predicted for the excited rotational levels from JPL database (up to J=20, K a =20) when missing in the CDMS catalog. The vibrational partition function could not be calculated because, as far as we know, there are neither fundamental energies nor excited vibrational energies reported in the literature at all. This hindrance could be overcome providing the vibrational fundamental energies calculated by ab initio or other empirical approaches. Therefore, the partition function in the present work is practically the same reported in CDMS apart from the uncertainties and the new values of the rotational partition function for temperatures from 300 K to 500 K.",

This spectrum is analyzed in terms of the wavefunctions and energy levels of Flaud and Camy-Peyret [J. Mol. Spectrosc. 51, 142 (1974)], and of the polarizability derivatives with respect to the dimensionless normal coordinates q1 and q3.

Tables with scattering strengths and energies of ro-vibrational transitions are provided in order to simulate the Raman spectrum of water vapor over a broad range of temperatures, from few Kelvin, under supersonic expansions, to high temperature, in combustion processes.

This approximation is only valid at sufficiently low temperatures when the asymmetry of the potential energy landscape for the vibrational energy states can be neglected. To quantify the magnitude of the errors introduced by the harmonic approximation, Table 2 presents the minimal, maximal, and mean errors of the temperature-dependent part of the Gibbs free energies of all molecules for all functionals and basis sets for two temperatures, 400 and 1500 K. The temperature-dependent term of the molecules arising from the vibrational contribution differs from its experimental counterpart by \u2212312.72 to 297.78 kJ mol \u22121 at 1500 K, while the range is only \u221245.53 to 60.53 kJ mol \u22121 at 400 K. Although these numbers seem huge, ultimately, we are only interested in energy differences between products and reactions. The variation over the different basis sets and functionals is minimal. When carrying out the sign analysis approach only at lower-temperature windows [39] (300-400 K), we found an improvement of 2-4 percent points in terms of the percentage of correct predictions made.

For comparison, the PS line list, which has 28,000 cm \u22121 cut-off gives a partition function at 3,000 K that is only 99.493% of the Vidler & Tennyson value.\n\nAlthough the exclusion of levels above 30,000 cm \u22121 does not materially affect the completeness of the BT2 list, it does affect absorption at shorter wavelengths. If we consider a photon of of wavelength 1 \u00b5m (energy 10,000 cm \u22121 ). This is able to be absorbed by a water molecule in a particular rotation-vibration eigenstate provided that there is another eigenstate exactly 10,000 cm \u22121 above this lower state into which the molecule may be excited. It follows that since the BT2 line list has an upper cut-off of 30,000 cm \u22121 , none of the energy levels in the list above 20,000 cm \u22121 are capable of being excited by a 1\u00b5m photon, since there is no corresponding upper level.\n\nIf we examine the extent to which Q(3,000K) computed from BT2, but excluding all levels above 20,000 cm \u22121 , falls short of the Vidler & Tennyson value we will have an indication (this is an upper limit as it takes no account of blending effects) of the opacity that has been excluded by adopting a 30,000 cm \u22121 cut-off. Performing the calculation gives a shortfall of 0.83%.",

Standard Enthalpy of Formation - \nA standard enthalpy of formation $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}$ is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess's law.\n\nThe standard enthalpy of formation of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g})$ is $-393.5 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$.

[28], while the heat capacity of NaCl(l) was recently recommended by van Oudenaren et al. [29].The authors critically reviewed the four studies available on the determination of the heat capacity of NaCl(l) [30][31][32][33] and found that there was no discrepancy between the data by Dawson et al. [33] and the rest of the authors, in contrast with what Glushko et al. had argued.Considering the average of the four studies, van Oudenaren et al. recommend (68 \u02d81) kJ \u00a8mol \u00b41 in the 1074 to 2500 K range.In the case of ThCl 4 (cr,l), the data used were recommended by Fuger et al. [5] and Capelli and Konings [34].As mentioned in the introduction, ThCl 4 crystallises in two phases.Using an adiabatic calorimeter, Chiotti et al. [35] measured an enthalpy of transition equal to (5.0 \u02d81.5) kJ \u00a8mol \u00b41 at (679 \u02d82) K. Taking the heat capacity of ThCl 4 -\u03b1 (the low-temperature phase) to be equal to that recommended for ThCl 4 -\u03b2 (the high-temperature phase), the standard enthalpy of formation and standard entropy of ThCl 4 -\u03b1 were optimised in this work, such that the transition between both phases matched the values reported by Chiotti et al. [35].The enthalpy of fusion (61.5 \u02d85.0) kJ \u00a8mol \u00b41, melting temperature (T = 1042 K), and heat capacity recommended by Capelli and Konings [34] were used to describe ThCl 4 (l).The thermodynamic functions of the intermediate compounds were optimised in this work to match the experimentally determined phase diagrams as closely as possible.All values are given in Table 2.\n\n\nLiquid Solution",

We have employed three different reactions to estimate the DeltaH(o)(f,298)(HOBr), namely, the atomization reaction and two homodesmic reactions. Our best estimation is DeltaH(o)(f,298) (HOBr) = -15.3 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol and is very likely to lie toward the more negative values. The present value is 1.4 kcal/mol lower than the widely used experimental determination of Ruscic and Berkowitz (J. Chem. Phys. 1994, 101, 7795), DeltaH(o)(f,298)(HOBr) &gt; -13.93 +/- 0.42 kcal/mol. However, it is closer to the more recent measurement of Lock et al. (J. Phys. Chem. 1996, 100, 7972), DeltaH(o)(f,298)(HOBr) = -14.8 +/- 1 kcal/mol. In the case of HOCl we have determined DeltaH(o)(f,298)(HOCl) = -18.1 +/- 0.3 kcal/mol, just in the middle of the two experimental values proposed, -17.8 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol (JANAF), obtained from equilibrium constant measurements, and -18.36 +/- 0.03 kcal/mol (Joens, J. A. J. Phys. Chem. A 2001, 105, 11041), determined from the measurements of the Cl-OH bond energy. If our conclusions are correct, several enthalpies of formation that have been determined by experimental chemists, Orlando and Burholder (J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 1143), and theoretical chemists, Lee (J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 15074), need to be revised, since a larger value was used for DeltaH(o)(f,298)(HOBr). Employing the results obtained by Orlando and Burkholder for Br(2)O we propose DeltaH(o)(f,298)(Br(2)O) = 24.9 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol, and employing Lee's enthalpies of reaction we propose the following DeltaH(o)(f,298): for BrBrO, HBrO, ClOBr, ClBrO, BrClO, BrCN, BrNC, BrNO, BrON, FOBr, and FBrO, 39.5 +/- 1, 41.0 +/- 1, 22.7 +/- 1.5, 34.2 +/- 1.5, 40.9 +/- 1.5, 43.7 +/- 1.5, 80.1 +/- 1.5, 22.3 +/- 1, 46.2 +/- 1, 17.3 +/- 1.5, and 6.3 +/- 1.5 kcal/mol, respectively. We expect that this work will stimulate new experimental measurements of the thermodynamic properties of HOBr and HOCl.",

The computed formation enthalpies are then benchmarked against the values recommended in the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT). The accuracy of the methods have been interpreted in terms of descriptive statistics, including the mean-signed error, mean-unsigned error, maximum average deviation, 2\u03c3 uncertainties, and 2\u00d7root-mean-square-deviations (2RMSD). The results highlight the following rank order of accuracy for the methods studied G4 &gt; G3 &gt; W1BD &gt; CBS-APNO &gt; CBS-QB3. The findings of this work are also considered in light of a recent companion study, which took an identical approach to quantifying the accuracies of these methods for 48 closed-shell singlet CxHyOz compounds. A similar order of accuracies and precisions were observed therein: G3 &gt; G4 &gt; W1BD &gt; CBS-APNO &gt; CBS-QB3. Both studies highlight systematic biases/deviations from the ATcT for the methods investigated, which are discussed in some detail, with methods having clear tendencies to over- or underpredict the recommended formation enthalpies for radical and/or closed-shell CxHyOz compounds. We show that one can improve the accuracy of their computation, and simultaneously reduce the uncertainty, by taking unweighted average formation enthalpies from various combinations of methods used. The reader should note that the statistical analyses preceding these conclusions also highlight that these error cancellation effects are unique for closed-shell and radical species. By extension, these error-cancellation effects can be expected to be different for various homologous series and chemical functionalities and their closed- and open-shell subgroups. Hence, further benchmarking studies are advised for other homologous series, such that the scientists and engineers (e.g., combustion/atmospheric/astrochemical) who frequently use these methods can assign reasonable uncertainties to their computations, while simultaneously optimizing their computational costs. For CxHyOz compounds, a combination of the CBS-APNO/G3/G4 methods is shown to be quite powerful when the atomization method is employed and is capable of reproducing the ATcT to within \"near-chemical-accuracy\", with 2RMSD (\u224895% confidence interval) values of 0.0 \u00b1 4.34 kJ mol(-1) computed for CxHyOz radicals, 0.0 \u00b1 4.22 kJ mol(-1) for closed-shell CxHyOz compounds, with a total uncertainty of 0.0 \u00b1 4.27 kJ mol(-1) subsequently computed considering all 85 CxHyOz compounds. Given the performance of these methods for determination of formation enthalpies when the atomization procedure is employed, we expect isodesmic reactions involving these methods to be capable of achieving chemical accuracy, as illustrated for the case of the tert-butyl radical. We also highlight that there is still disagreement between experiment and theory for this radical, despite its significance in gas-phase chemistry. Kineticists, thermodynamicists, and chemical kinetic modellers alike are warned that the popular CBS-QB3 method is found to have particularly poor performance, with a computed 2RMSD of 0.0 \u00b1 12.51 kJ mol(-1), indicating that one should not apply this method in isolation for formation enthalpy determination unless other error-cancellation strategies are employed.

On the basis of potential energy hypersurfaces obtained at the CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, high-pressure limiting rate coefficients have been calculated using variable reaction coordinate transition state theory. Over the temperature range 300-3000 K, the following expressions were obtained in units of cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1): k(infinity)(H + O2) = (25T(-0.367) + (7.5 x 10(-2)) T(0.702)) x 10(-11) and k(infinity)(H + OH) = (4.17 x 10(-11)) T(0.234)exp (57.5/T). Available experimental data on the pressure dependence of the reactions were analyzed using a two-dimensional master equation. The following low-pressure limiting rate coefficients were obtained over the temperature range 300-3000 K in units of cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1): k0(H + O2 + Ar) = (9.1x10(-29)) T(-1.404)exp (-134/T), k0(H + O2 + N2) = (2.0x10(-27)) T(-1.73)exp (-270/T), k0(H + OH + Ar) = (8.6x10(-28)) T(-1.527)exp (-185/T), and k0(H + OH + N2) = (1.25x10(-26)) T(-1.81)exp (-251/T). For the H + O2 reaction system, F(cent)(Ar) = 0.67 and F(cent)(N2) = 0.72 were obtained as center broadening factors, whereas F(cent)(Ar) = 0.72 and F(cent)(N2) = 0.73 were obtained for the H + OH reaction system. The calculations provide a good description of most of the experimental data, except the room temperature measurements on the H + OH (+M) --&gt; H2O (+M) reaction.",

The CH2CHO radicals were produced by the laser-flash photolysis of ethyl vinyl ether at 193 nm and by the reaction F + CH3CHO, respectively. Laser-induced fluorescence excited at 337 or 347.4 nm was used to monitor the CH2CHO concentration. The reaction proceeded via reversible complex formation with subsequent isomerization and fast decomposition: CH2CHO + O2 &lt;= =&gt; O2CH2CHO --&gt; HO2CH2CO --&gt; products. The rate coefficients for the first and second steps were determined (k1, k-1, k2) and analyzed by a master equation with specific rate coefficients from the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory. Molecular and transition-state parameters were obtained from quantum chemical calculations. A third-law analysis led to the following thermodynamic parameters for the first step: Delta(R)S degrees 300K(1) = -144 J K(-1) mol(-1) (1 bar) and Delta(R)H degrees 300K(1) = (-101 +/- 4) kJ mol(-1). From the falloff analysis, the following temperature dependencies for the low- and high-pressure limiting rate coefficients were obtained: k1(0) = 5.14 x 10(-14) exp(210 K/T) cm(-3) s(-1); k1(infinity) = 1.7 x 10(-12) exp(-520 K/T) cm(-3) s(-1); and k2(infinity) = 1.3 x 10(12) exp[-(82 +/- 4) kJ mol(-1)/RT] s(-1). Readily applicable analytical representations for the pressure and temperature dependence of k1 were derived to be used in kinetic modeling.",

The vibrational quantum number and the temperature were selected over the ranges nu=0 to 15, and T=300 to 10 000 K, respectively. All other variables were averaged. Rate constants were determined for the energy transfer process, H+O(2)(nu)--&gt;H+O(2)(nu(\")), for the bimolecular exchange process, H+O(2)(nu)--&gt;OH(nu('))+O, and for the dissociative process, H+O(2)(nu)--&gt;H+O+O. The dissociative process appears to be a mere extension of the process of transferring large amounts of energy. State-to-state rate constants are given for the exchange reaction, and they are in reasonable agreement with previous results, while the energy transfer and dissociative rate constants have never been reported previously. The lifetime distributions of the HO(2) complex, calculated as a function of v and temperature, were used as a basis for determining the relative contributions of various vibrational states of O(2) to the thermal rate coefficients for recombination at various pressures. This novel approach, based on the complex's ability to survive until it collides in a secondary process with an inert gas, is used here for the first time. Complete falloff curves for the recombination of H+O(2) are also calculated over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The combination of the two separate studies results in pressure- and temperature-dependent rate constants for H+O(2)(nu)(+Ar) right arrow over left arrow HO(2)(+Ar). It is found that, unlike the exchange reaction, vibrational and rotational-translational energy are liabilities in promoting recombination.",

Optimized geometries and frequencies were obtained at the CCSD(T) level for all molecules except for NO, NO(2), and NO(3), for which UCCSD(T) was used. In all cases the aug-cc-pVDZ (avdz) basis set was employed. The electronic energies of all species were obtained from complete basis set extrapolations (to aug-cc-pV5Z) using five different extrapolation methods. The [U]CCSD(T)/avdz geometries and frequencies of the N(x)O(y) compounds are compared with literature values, and problems associated with the values and assignments of low-frequency modes are discussed. The standard entropies are compared with values cited in the NIST/JANAF tables [NIST-JANAF Thermochemical Tables, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data Monograph No. 9, 4th ed. edited by M. W. Chase, Jr. (American Chemical Society and American Institute of Physics, Woodbury, NY, 1988)]. With the exception of I, in which the dimer is weakly bound, and V, for which thermodynamic data appears to be lacking, the calculated standard thermodynamic functions of reaction are in good agreement with literature values obtained both from statistical mechanical and various equilibrium methods. A multireference-configuration interaction calculation (MRCI+Q) for I provides a D(e) value that is consistent with previous calculations. The combined uncertainties of the NIST/JANAF values for Delta(r)H(o), Delta(r)G(o), and Delta(r)S(o) of II, III, and IV are discussed. The potential surface for the dissociation of N(2)O(4) was explored using multireference methods. No evidence of a barrier to dissociation was found.",

Methyl radicals were generated by laser flash photolysis of azomethane or acetone. Methylperoxy radicals were monitored by UV absorption at 240 nm. The falloff curves of the rate constants are represented by the simplified expression k/k(infinity) approximately [x/(1 + x)]F(cent)(1/{1+[(log)(x)/)(N)(]2}) with x = k(0)/k(infinity) F(cent) approximately 0.33, and N approximately 1.47, where k(0) and k(infinity) denote the limiting low and high-pressure rate constants, respectively. At low temperatures, 300-400 K, and pressures &gt;300 bar, a fairly abrupt increase of the rate constants beyond the values given by the falloff expressions was observed. This effect is attributed to a contribution from the radical complex mechanism as was also observed in other recombination reactions of larger radicals. Equal limiting low-pressure rate constants k(0) = [M]7 x 10(-31)(T/300 K)(-3.0) cm(6) molecule(-2) s(-1) were fitted for M = Ar and N(2) whereas limiting high-pressure rate constants k(infinity) = 2.2 x 10(-12)(T/300 K)(0.9) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) were approached. These values are discussed in terms of unimolecular rate theory. It is concluded that a theoretical interpretation of the derived rate constants has to be postponed until better information of the potential energy surface is available. Preliminary theoretical evaluation suggests that there is an \"anisotropy bottleneck\" in the otherwise barrierless interaction potential between CH(3) and O(2).",

The CO(2) emission involves Deltanu(3) = -1 transitions from highly vibrationally excited states, whereas emission of OCS is mainly from the transition (0, 0 degrees , 1) --&gt; (0, 0 degrees , 0); the latter derives its energy via near-resonant V-V energy transfer from highly excited CO(2). Rotationally resolved emission lines of CO (v &lt;or= 4 and J &lt;or= 30) were also observed in the reaction O((1)D) + OCS. For O((3)P) + OCS, weak emission of CO(2) diminishes when Ar is added, indicating that O((3)P) is translationally hot to overcome the barrier for CO(2) formation. The band contour of CO(2) agrees with a band shape simulated on the basis of a Dunham expansion model of CO(2); the average vibrational energy of CO(2) in this channel is 49% of the available energy. This vibrational distribution fits with that estimated through a statistical partitioning of energy E* congruent with 18,000 +/- 500 cm(-1) into all vibrational modes of CO(2). For the reaction of O((1)D) + OCS, approximately 51% of the available energy is converted into vibrational energy of CO(2), and a statistical prediction using E* congruent with 30,000 +/- 500 cm(-1) best fits the data. The mechanisms of these reactions are also investigated with the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df)//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) method. The results indicate that the triplet O((3)P) + OCS(X(1)Sigma(+)) surface proceeds via direct abstraction and substitution channels with barriers of 27.6 and 36.4 kJ mol(-1), respectively, to produce SO(X(3)Sigma(-)) + CO(X(1)Sigma(+)) and S((3)P) + CO(2)(X(1)A(1)), whereas two intermediates, OSCO and SC(O)O, are formed from the singlet O((1)D) + OCS(X(1)Sigma(+)) surface without barrier, followed by decomposition to SO(a(1)Delta) + CO(X(1)Sigma(+)) and S((1)D) + CO(2)(X(1)A(1)), respectively.

Using these molecular parameters resulted in a discrepancy between the calculations and the database of rate constants of a factor of ca. 4 at, or close to, the low-pressure limit. Agreement between calculation and experiment could be achieved in two ways, either by increasing DeltaH0o to an unrealistically high value (149.3 kJ mol-1) or by increasing DeltaEd, the average energy transferred in a downward collision, to an unusually large value (&gt;5000 cm-1). The discrepancy could also be reduced by making all overall rotations fully active. The system was relatively insensitive to changing the moments of inertia in the transition state to increase the centrifugal effect. The possibility of involvement of BrOONO was tested and cannot account for the difficulties of fitting the data.",

A flow tube apparatus that utilized a chemical singlet oxygen generator was used to measure the I(2) dissociation rate in O(2)(a (1)Delta)/I(2) mixtures. Vibrationally excited I(2)(X) is thought to be a significant intermediate in the dissociation process.

Ab initio elucidation of the experimentally elusive ground state rotation-vibration spectrum.\nThe electron-deficient diatomic boron molecule has long puzzled scientists. As yet, the complete set of bound vibrational energy levels is far from being known, experimentally as well as theoretically. In the present ab initio study, all rotational-vibrational levels of the X (3)\u03a3(g)(-) ground state are determined up to the dissociation limit with near-spectroscopic accuracy (&lt;10 cm(-1)). Two complete sets of bound vibrational levels for the (11)B(2) and (11)B-(10)B isotopomers, containing 38 and 37 levels, respectively, are reported. The results are based on a highly accurate potential energy curve, which also includes relativistic effects. The calculated set of all vibrational levels of the (11)B(2) isotopomer is compared with the few results derived from experiment [Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Nzohabonayo, P. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1982, 93, 281; Bredohl, H.; Dubois, I.; and Melen, F. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 1987, 121, 128]. Theory agrees with experiment within 4.5 cm(-1) on average for the four vibrational level spacings that are so far known empirically. In addition, the present theoretical analysis suggests, however, that the transitions from higher electronic states to the ground state vibrational levels v = 12-15 deserve to be reanalyzed. Whereas previous experimental investigators considered them to originate from the v' = 0 vibrational level of the upper state (2)(3)\u03a3(u)(-), the present results make it likely that these transitions originate from a different upper state, namely the v' = 16 or the v' = 17 vibrational level of the (1)(3)\u03a3(u)(-) state. The ground state dissociation energy D(0) is predicted to be 23164 cm(-1).",

The vibration-rotation energy levels of the perturbed A 2Pi and B' 2Sigma+ states were fitted as individual term values, while those of the X 2Sigma+ ground state were fitted using the direct-potential-fit approach. A new analytic potential energy function that imposes the theoretically correct attractive potential at long-range, and a radial Hamiltonian that includes the spin-rotation interaction were employed, and a significantly improved value for the ground state dissociation energy of MgH was obtained. The v''=11 level of the X 2Sigma+ ground electronic state was found to be the highest bound vibrational level of 24MgH, lying only about 13 cm(-1) below the dissociation asymptote. The equilibrium dissociation energy for the X 2Sigma+ ground state of 24MgH has been determined to be De=11104.7+/-0.5 cm(-1) (1.37681+/-0.00006 eV), whereas the zero-point energy (v''=0) is 739.11+/-0.01 cm(-1).

The uncertainty in the new experimental dissociation energy of MgH is more than 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that for the best value available in the literature.

Flaud, P. Arcas, H. Burger, O. Polanz, and L. Halonen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 183, 310-335 (1997), and references therein) by means of the MORBID (Morse Oscillator Rigid Bender Internal Dynamics) computer program. The fitting to all 1111 input data (involving rotation-vibrational states with J &lt;/= 10) had a standard deviation of 0.18 cm-1 and was obtained by varying 14 parameters. With the new potential energy function, the rotation-vibration energies of H2130Te have been calculated with the MORBID program. In particular, we have calculated the rotational energy manifolds for J &lt;/= 40 in the lowest vibrational states. Compared to previous potential energy functions for H2Te, the new function has substantially improved the reproduction of the rotational spacings in the excited vibrational states. An important aim of the present work is the further characterization of the anomalous \"fourfold cluster effect\" (i.e., the formation of four-member groups of nearly degenerate rotation-vibration energies at high rotational excitation) exhibited by the energy levels of H2Te. Comparison of our theoretical results with the experimental results of J.-M. Flaud, M. Betrencourt, P. Arcas, H. Burger, O. Polanz, and W. J. Lafferty (1997, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 182, 396-420) provides conclusive evidence for the existence of so-called Type II clusters (clusters formed by coalescence of two energy doublets belonging to two different vibrational states) in the nu1/nu3 vibrational states of H2130Te.

Analytical potential energy curves of spectroscopic accuracy (i.e., approximately 1 meV) were determined for all six low-lying electronic states using a global model, which includes the first (charge-induced dipole, proportional to 1/R(4)) member of the long-range interaction series and treats the spin-orbit interaction explicitly.

It is shown that a recent H216O potential energy surface due to D. Xie and G. Yan (1996. Chem. Phys. Lett. 248, 409), which was determined by fits to vibrational term values alone and was claimed to be more accurate than other published spectroscopically determined potentials for this system, actually gives unacceptably poor results for rotationally excited water. Reasons for this failure are discussed and the dangers of relying on vibrational term values alone are emphasized. Previous spectroscopic potentials for ground state NO2 are all found to have problems with unphysical minima (\"holes\"). Starting from the potential energy surface for the ground (&amp;Xtilde;2A1) electronic state of NO2 constructed by S. A. Tashkun and P. Jensen (1994. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 165, 173) using the approximate MORBID approach a suitable starting point for fits using an exact kinetic energy operator approach was constructed. Least-squares fits to 17 potential parameters gives a potential which reproduces 173 vibrational term values with a standard deviation of only 2.8 cm-1 in the low-energy region (&lt;10 000 cm-1). For many even levels below, and all levels above, approximately 10 000 cm-1 the first excited electronic state (&amp;Atilde;2B2) perturbs the vibrational energy levels of the ground state. We were unable to fit these levels. Tests show that the resulting effective potential surface has no problems with unphysical holes and gives a reasonable representation of the rotational structure of the low-lying vibrational states of NO2.

The electronic state of the open-shell diatomic fragment is a 2S+1Sigma state, where S &gt;/= 12, the close-shell partner could be a rare gas atom or a diatomic molecule or a planar polyatomic molecule. We are considering a near-rigid rotor model for a nonlinear complex, taking into account thoroughly all effects of the electron spin and the quartic centrifugal distortion correction terms. The total Hamiltonian is expressed as H=Hrot+Hsr+Hss+Hcd+Hsrcd+Hsscd. We have derived all the nonvanishing matrix elements of the Hamiltonian operators in the molecular basis set. The rotational energy levels are calculated by numerical diagonalization of the total Hamiltonian matrix for each J value. The nonvanishing matrix elements of the electric dipole moment operator are derived in the molecular basis set for electronic, vibrational, and microwave transitions within the complex. Expectation values of the quantum numbers and of the parities of the rotational states are derived in the molecular basis set. Relative intensities of the allowed rotational transitions, expectation values of the quantum numbers and the parities are calculated numerically in the space of the eigenvectors obtained from diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. The formalism and the computer program of this paper are considered as extensions to our previous work [W. M. Fawzy and J. T. Hougen, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 137, 154-165 (1989); W. M. Fawzy, J. Mol.

All available spectroscopic data then provide the basis for generating an accurately determined vibrationally complete semiempirical intermolecular potential function using a four-dimensional potential coordinate morphing methodology. These results are consistent with the existence of four bound isomers: OC-HI, OC-IH, CO-HI, and CO-IH. Analysis also leads to unequivocal characterization of the common isotopic ground state as having the OC-HI structure and with the first excited state having the OC-IH structure with an energy of 3.4683(80) cm(-1) above the ground state. The potential is consistent with the following barriers between the pairs of isomers: 382(4) cm(-1) (OC-IH/OC-HI), 294(5) cm(-1) (CO-IH/CO-HI), 324(3) cm(-1) (OC-IH/CO-IH), and 301(2) cm(-1) (OC-HI/CO-HI) defined with respect to each lower minimum. The potential is also determined to have a linear OC-IH van der Waals global equilibrium minimum structure having R(e)=4.180(11) \u00c5, \u03b8(1)=0.00(1)\u00b0, and \u03b8(2)=0.00(1)\u00b0. This is differentiated from its OC-HI ground state hydrogen bound structure having R(0)=4.895(1) \u00c5, \u03b8(1)=20.48(1)\u00b0, and \u03b8(2)=155.213(1)\u00b0 where the distances are defined between the centers of mass of the monomers and \u03b8(1) and \u03b8(2) as cos(-1)[&lt;cos(2) \u03b8(i)&gt;(1/2)] for i=1 and 2. A fundamentally new molecular phenomenon - ground state isotopic isomerization is proposed based on the generated semiempirical potential. The protonated ground state hydrogen-bonded OC-HI structure is predicted to be converted on deuteration to the corresponding ground state van der Waals OC-ID isomeric structure. This results in a large anomalous isotope effect in which the R(0) center of mass distance between monomeric components changes from 4.895(1) to 4.286(1) \u00c5. Such a proposed isotopic effect is demonstrated to be a consequence of differential zero point energy factors resulting from the shallower nature of hydrogen bonding at a local potential minimum (greater quartic character of the potential) relative to the corresponding van der Waals global minimum. Further consequences of this anomalous deuterium isotope effect are also discussed.",

The potential function yields an accurate representation of spectroscopic data that span 99.24% of the well depth and the number of fitted parameters is significantly less than half the number of parameters determined in conventional Dunham analyses. A novel variant of the Morse/long-range potential model has been employed in the representation of the ground state potential, and a critical comparison has been made with an extended modified Lennard-Jones potential model. Proper account has been taken of the known long-range van der Waals form of the potential, and our final potential function is determined with constrained literature values of the C(8) and C(10) dispersion energy coefficients, along with a fitted value of C(6)=3.31(5) x 10(7) cm(-1) A(6)=6870(100) a.u. The fitted dissociation energy (D(e)) is compared with the precisely known value based on the recent analysis of data from a two-photon transfer process (STIRAP) in ultracold Cs atoms. It is concluded that hyperfine effects in the X (1)Sigma(g)(+) state are not negligible, and that the estimate of D(e)=3649.84(7) cm(-1) obtained in this work represents an effective dissociation limit lying between the two lowest hyperfine limits. Precise rotational and centrifugal distortion constants for the ground electronic state have also been calculated through conventional perturbation theory. These estimates are fully consistent with the derived potential function and the experimental spectroscopic information.",

The X(1)\u03a3(+) state is very weakly bound, (D(e) = 469.4 cm(-1) at R(e) = 3.241 \u00c5), whereas the A(1)\u03a0 state, which correlates with the excited dissociation channel [Mg KL3s3p(1)P(o) + Be 1s(2)2s(2) (1)S], is bound rather strongly (D(e) = 19 394 cm(-1) (55.5 kcal/mol) at R(e) = 2.385 \u00c5). The X(1)\u03a3(+) state supports 12 vibrational levels, for which vibrationally averaged dipole moments, &lt;\u03bc&gt;(\u03c5), were obtained, while 71 vibrational levels were found for A(1)\u03a0. For the level (X(1)\u03a3(+)), &lt;\u03bc&gt;(0) = 0.213 D. The \u03c5(\") = 7 and 8 X(1)\u03a3(+) vibrational levels are found to have the highest probability to be reached via emission from the lowest lying vibrational levels of A(1)\u03a0. The work had a dual outcome: First, it explored consequences of different choices of the state-specific reference \"Fermi-sea\" space (\"active\" space), which is required for the construction and execution of the multiconfigurational \"complete active space self-consistent field\" calculations and the subsequent multi-reference CI calculations. In this context, comparisons with results on the weakly bound ground states of the homonuclear Be(2) and Mg(2) molecules were made. Second, it produced reliable data for the short- as well as the long-range parts of the potential energy curve (PEC). Such information is relevant to analyses concerning cold and ultra-cold Physics and Chemistry. For example, accurate fits to the X(1)\u03a3(+) PEC, which was computed to nano-Hartree accuracy, with account for basis-set-superposition error, produced the C(6) and C(8) dispersion coefficients as 364.3 \u00b1 1.1 a.u. and 28 000 \u00b1 500 a.u., respectively. The result for C(6) is in excellent agreement with that of Derevianko et al. [At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 96, 323 (2010)], (364 \u00b1 4 a.u.), that was obtained in the framework of the theory of long-range interactions and many-body calculations on the constituent atoms. On the other hand, our result for C(8) differs from that of Standard and Certain [J. Chem. Phys. 83, 3002 (1985)] by about 7000 a.u.",

The data revealed the existence of new unknown states besides the ground state 2 \u03a3 + g and the first excited state 2 \u03a0 u of H + 2 . The first theoretical calculations of the states were made by Bottcher and Docken in 1974 [2], who calculated the energy position and widths for dissociative Q 1 1 \u03a0 u and Q 2 1 \u03a0 u states for 1a.u. \u2264 R \u2264 10a.u., using the Feshbach projection-operators [3]. More recently S\u00e1nchez and Mart\u00edn [4] have done systematic calculations in which they estimated tens of doubly excited states symmetries and their autoionization widths for 1,3 \u03a3 + g,u , 1,3 \u03a0 g,u and 1,3 \u2206 g,u , in the range of 0 \u2264 R \u2264 5a.u.. They employed the Feshbach projectionoperator method and a L 2 representation of the non resonant continuum, with B-spline type functions. In what concerns the dissociation into neutral atoms, perhaps the most relevant theoretical work in the recent years was done by Dalgarno and collaborators [5] who calculated the doubly excited H 2 states converging to H(n=2) + H(n'=2) for all the internuclear distances. Using different techniques to solve for each internuclear distance region and taking special care of intermediate distances in order to connect the different regimes in which calculations were done, they were able to calculate potential energy curves from 3 a.u. to 200 a.u. Recently our experimental group [6] observed the pair H(2s) + H(2s) by measuring neutral fragments in coincidence after H 2 dissociation induced by electron impact, confirming for the first time the existence of such states. The purpose of the present work is to shed light on the description of the doubly excited states that may dissociate onto a pair H(2s) + H(2s), since this dissociation channel, as discussed in [7], may be used to probe the spin coherence between",

At the lowest collision energy, F* is approximately 1.6 times more reactive than F, although reaction of F* is forbidden within the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation. As the collision energy increases, the BO-allowed reaction rapidly dominates. We found excellent agreement between multistate, quantum reactive scattering calculations and both the measured energy dependence of the F*/F reactivity ratio and the differential cross sections. This agreement confirms the fundamental understanding of the factors controlling electronic nonadiabaticity in abstraction reactions.",

The observation of Franck-Condon-forbidden transitions to vibrational levels of the X(+) state of the cation with v(+) \u2265 25 is rationalized by a mechanism involving vertical excitation of predissociative Rydberg states of mixed singlet-triplet character with an A(+) ion core which are coupled to Rydberg states converging to high-v(+) levels of the X(+) state. The same mechanism is proposed to also be responsible for the observation of Cl(+) - Cl(-) ion pairs and quartet states in the photoionization of Cl2. The potential energy function of the X(+) state of Cl2 (+) was determined in a direct fit to the experimental data. Transitions to vibrational levels of the A(+)\u2009(2)\u03a0u, 3\u22152 and B(+)\u2009(2)\u0394u, 3\u22152 states of Cl2 (+) could be identified using the results of a recent analysis of the strong perturbation between the A(+)\u2009(2)\u03a0u, 3\u22152 and B(+)\u2009(2)\u0394u, 3\u22152 states of Cl2 (+) observed in the A(+) - X(+) band system [Gharaibeh et al., J. Chem. Phys. 137, 194317 (2012)], and transitions to several vibrational levels of the upper spin-orbit component ((2)\u03a0u, 1\u22152) of the A(+) state were detected in the photoelectron spectrum of Cl2 (+). The a(+) (4)\u03a3u (-)\u2190X(1)\u03a3g (+) photoelectron band system, which is nominally forbidden by single-photon ionization from the ground state was also observed for the first time and its vibrational and spin-orbit structures were analyzed. The (4)\u03a3u (-) state is split into two spin-orbit components with \u03a9 = 1\u22152 and \u03a9 = 3\u22152, separated by 37.5 cm(-1). The vibrational energy level structure of both components is regular, which indicates that the splitting results from the interaction with one or more distant ungerade \u03a9 = 1\u22152 or \u03a9 = 3\u22152 electronic states.",

Spectrosc. 181, 207-214), rotation-vibration energy levels for the electronic ground state X3B1 of the amidogen ion, NH2+, were predicted using the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program with an ab initio potential energy surface. In the present paper we calculate a new ab initio potential energy surface for the X3B1 state, and we calculate ab initio the potential energy surfaces of the a1A1 and b1B1 excited singlet electronic states (which become degenerate as a 1Delta state at linearity). We use the multireference configuration interaction (MR-CI) level of theory with molecular orbital bases that are optimized separately for each state by complete-active-space SCF (CASSCF) calculations. For the X state we use the MORBID Hamiltonian and computer program to obtain the rotation-vibration energies. For the a and b excited singlet electronic states we calculate the rovibronic energy levels using the RENNER Hamiltonian and computer program. We also calculate ab initio the dipole moment surfaces for the X, a, and b electronic states, and the out-of-plane transition moment surface for the b &lt;-- a electronic transition. We use this information to simulate absorption spectra within X3B1 and a1A1 state and of the b1B1 &lt;-- a1A1 transition in order to aid in the search for them. Copyright 1997 Academic Press.

First we present high-level electronic structure calculations by the W1, G3SX, MCG3-MPWB, CBS-APNO, and MC-QCISD/3 methods that lead to a best estimate of the barrier height of 11.8+/-0.5 kcal/mol. Then we obtain a specific reaction parameter for the MPW density functional in order that it reproduces the best estimate of the barrier height; this yields the MPW54 functional. The MPW54 functional, as well as the MPW60 functional that was previously parametrized for the H+CH(4) reaction, is used with canonical variational theory with small-curvature tunneling to calculate the rate constants for all four ethane reactions from 200 to 2000 K. The final MPW54 calculations are based on curvilinear-coordinate generalized-normal-mode analysis along the reaction path, and they include scaled frequencies and an anharmonic C-C bond torsion. They agree with experiment within 31% for 467-826 K except for a 38% deviation at 748 K; the results for the isotopologs are predictions since these rate constants have never been measured. The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) are analyzed to reveal the contributions from subsets of vibrational partition functions and from tunneling, which conspire to yield a nonmonotonic temperature dependence for one of the KIEs. The stationary points and reaction-path potential of the MPW54 potential-energy surface are then used to parametrize a new kind of analytical potential-energy surface that combines a semiempirical valence bond formalism for the reactive part of the molecule with a standard molecular mechanics force field for the rest; this may be considered to be either an extension of molecular mechanics to treat a reactive potential-energy surface or a new kind of combined quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method in which the QM part is semiempirical valence bond theory; that is, the new potential-energy surface is a combined valence bond molecular mechanics (CVBMM) surface. Rate constants calculated with the CVBMM surface agree with the MPW54 rate constants within 12% for 534-2000 K and within 23% for 200-491 K. The full CVBMM potential-energy surface is now available for use in variety of dynamics calculations, and it provides a prototype for developing CVBMM potential-energy surfaces for other reactions.",

In contrast, the SLIC pulse sequence in Fig. 1 [21,22] consists of three pulses. First a hard 90-degree pulse creates transverse magnetization (I 1x +I 2x in the case of a ypulse), then the transverse magnetization is irradiated along the direction of the magnetization. A typical application requires irradiation with a locking field equal to the carboncarbon J-coupling (\u03c9 1 \u22482\u03c0*180 Hz) for typical times of about 250 ms, and decreases the power dissipation to <0.1 times the SAR limit.",

In an effort to improve defibrillation efficacy, we examined the relative defibrillation efficacy of a 65% tilt biphasic pulse from a 90-mu F capacitor compared to a 65% tilt biphasic pulse from a 120-mu F capacitor in a prospective, randomized fashion in 16 consecutive cardiac arrest survivors undergoing defibrillator surgery.

Various human-subject experiments have studied the amplitude and frequency dependence of these thresholds for gradient or homogeneous magnetic fields. Another contributing factor was shown to be number of cycles in a magnetic pulse, where the thresholds decreased with longer pulses. The latter result was demonstrated on two subjects only, at a single frequency of 1.27 kHz. Hence, whether the observed effect was due to the number of cycles or due to the pulse duration was not specified. In addition, a gradient-type field was utilized; hence, whether the same phenomenon applies to homogeneous magnetic fields remained unknown. Here, the authors investigate the pulse duration dependence of magnetostimulation limits for a 20-fold range of frequencies using homogeneous magnetic fields, such as the ones used for the drive field in MPI. Magnetostimulation thresholds were measured in the arms of six healthy subjects (age: 27 \u00b1 5 yr). Each experiment comprised testing the thresholds at eight different pulse durations between 2 and 125 ms at a single frequency, which took approximately 30-40 min/subject. A total of 34 experiments were performed at three different frequencies: 1.2, 5.7, and 25.5 kHz. A solenoid coil providing homogeneous magnetic field was used to induce stimulation, and the field amplitude was measured in real time. A pre-emphasis based pulse shaping method was employed to accurately control the pulse durations. Subjects reported stimulation via a mouse click whenever they felt a twitching/tingling sensation. A sigmoid function was fitted to the subject responses to find the threshold at a specific frequency and duration, and the whole procedure was repeated at all relevant frequencies and pulse durations. The magnetostimulation limits decreased with increasing pulse duration (T(pulse)). For T(pulse) &lt; 18 ms, the thresholds were significantly higher than at the longest pulse durations (p &lt; 0.01, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The normalized magnetostimulation threshold (B(Norm)) vs duration curve at all three frequencies agreed almost identically, indicating that the observed effect is independent of the operating frequency. At the shortest pulse duration (T(pulse) \u2248 2 ms), the thresholds were approximately 24% higher than at the asymptotes. The thresholds decreased to within 4% of their asymptotic values for T(pulse) &gt; 20 ms. These trends were well characterized (R(2) = 0.78) by a stretched exponential function given by B(Norm)=1+\u03b1e(-T(pulse)/\u03b2(\u03b3)) , where the fitted parameters were \u03b1 = 0.44, \u03b2 = 4.32, and \u03b3 = 0.60. This work shows for the first time that the magnetostimulation thresholds decrease with increasing pulse duration, and that this effect is independent of the operating frequency. Normalized threshold vs duration trends are almost identical for a 20-fold range of frequencies: the thresholds are significantly higher at short pulse durations and settle to within 4% of their asymptotic values for durations longer than 20 ms. These results emphasize the importance of matching the human-subject experiments to the imaging conditions of a particular setup. Knowing the dependence of the safety limits to all contributing factors is critical for increasing the time-efficiency of imaging systems that utilize time-varying magnetic fields.",

This study used strength-duration and percent success curves for defibrillation with monophasic and biphasic truncated exponential waveforms to explore these mechanisms. In part 1, defibrillation thresholds were determined for both high- and low-tilt waveforms. The monophasic pulses tested ranged in duration from 1.0 to 20.0 msec, and the biphasic waveforms had first phases of either 3.5 or 7.0 msec and second phases ranging from 1.0 to 20.0 msec. In part 2, defibrillation percent success curves were constructed for 6.0 msec/6.0 msec biphasic waveforms with a constant phase-one amplitude and with phase-two amplitudes of approximately 21%, 62%, 94%, and 141% of phase one. This study shows that if the first phase of a biphasic waveform is held constant and the second phase is increased in either duration or amplitude, defibrillation efficacy first improves, then declines, and then again improves. For pulse durations of at least 14 msec, the second-phase defibrillation threshold voltage of a high-tilt biphasic waveform is higher than that of a monophasic pulse equal in duration to the biphasic second phase (p less than 0.05), indicating that the previously proposed hypothesis of stimulation by the second phase is not the sole mechanism of biphasic defibrillation. These facts indicate the importance of the degree of tilt for the defibrillation efficacy of biphasic waveforms and suggest at least two mechanisms exist for defibrillation with these waveforms, one that is more effective for smaller second phases and another that becomes more effective as the second phase is increased.",

However, a detailed evaluation of the strength-duration relationship for human transvenous defibrillation has not been performed previously. This was a prospective study of 29 patients undergoing initial defibrillator implantation with a uniform dual coil, transvenous lead. In each patient defibrillation thresholds were measured for either short (2, 3, 4, 6 ms) or long (6, 12, 18 ms) pulse durations, with the order of testing randomized. The shock waveform was a truncated monophasic pulse from a capacitor of 150 microF. The leading edge voltage at defibrillation threshold was 566+/-100 V for 2-ms pulses. Voltages declined exponentially with increasing pulse width reaching an asymptote by 6 ms (451+/-68 V, P&lt;.05). Defibrillation threshold voltage was insensitive to longer pulse widths. Stored energy at defibrillation threshold showed a similar relationship with pulse width. In contrast, mean current decreased monotonically over the full range of pulse durations evaluated, and there was no evidence of a rheobase.

In the present work we have carried out a systematic study using both numerical and experimental approaches to evaluate \u03b3-encoded radio frequency (RF) pulse sequences based on R-symmetries that recouple (1)H CSA in the indirect dimension of a 2D (1)H/(1)H anisotropic/isotropic chemical shift correlation experiment under ultrafast magic angle spinning (MAS) frequencies. The spectral resolution and sensitivity can be significantly improved in both frequency dimensions of the 2D (1)H/(1)H correlation spectrum without decoupling (1)H/(1)H dipolar couplings but by using ultrafast MAS rates up to 70 kHz. We successfully demonstrate that with a reasonable RF field requirement (&lt;200 kHz) a set of symmetry-based recoupling sequences, with a series of phase-alternating 270\u00b00-90\u00b0180 composite-180\u00b0 pulses, are more robust in combating B1 inhomogeneity effects. In addition, our results show that the new pulse sequences render remarkable (1)H CSA recoupling efficiency and undistorted CSA lineshapes. Experimental results on citric acid and malonic acid comparing the efficiencies of these newly developed pulse sequences with that of previously reported CSA recoupling pulse sequences are also reported under ultrafast MAS conditions.",

The SNR was measured at the center of a spherical water saline phantom with a gradient-recalled echo sequence. Measurements were performed at NeuroSpin at 3, 7, and 11.7\u2009T. The phantom was then shipped to Maastricht University and then to the University of Minnesota for additional data points at 7, 9.4, and 10.5\u2009T.

Phantom electrical properties were characterized over the corresponding frequency range. Electrical properties were found to barely vary over the frequency range.

The treatment energies were following an escalating protocol for PE waveform (120-200-200J in AF and 30-120-200J in AFL) and LE waveform (100-200-200J in AF and 30-100-200J in AFL).

We studied these markers as well as the significance of P-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1) in relation to the P-wave axis (P-axis). We appraised our previously studied sample of 500 consecutively numbered, otherwise unselected, electrocardiograms (ECGs) of outpatients from the University of Massachusetts, Worcester, Massachusetts, for the foregoing P-wave characteristics. P-disp, defined as the difference of the duration between the widest and narrowest P wave, and the greatest P-dur after a 12-lead ECG search, was measured manually to the nearest 10 ms. PTFV1 was considered positive when &gt; or = 40 mm2 terminal deflection was present on biphasic P waves on lead V1. Normal P-axis was considered 0 degrees to +75 degrees by manually constructing the mean frontal plane electrical P-axis from standard limb leads. After excluding those with atrial arrhythmias, paced rhythms, errors in lead placement, P waves with low amplitude or overall technically poor tracing, 428 ECGs formed our final sample. P-dur was strongly associated with P-disp (P &lt; 0.0001), but the correlation remained weak (r = 0.42).

When considering P-axis in tertiles and quintiles, P-dur was greater in patients with a positive PTFV1 and significant within the normal range of the P-axis, especially from 0 degrees to +60 degrees . P-dur, P-disp, and PTFV1 appear to share a significant tripartite association in relation to the normal P-axis, particularly when P-axis ranges 0 degrees to +60 degrees .

We prospectively and randomly compared the defibrillation efficacy of a 60-microF and a 120-microF capacitance asymmetrical 65% tilt biphasic waveform using a unipolar defibrillation system in 38 consecutive cardiac arrest survivors before implantation of a presently available standard transvenous defibrillation system. The right ventricular defibrillation electrode had a 5-cm coil located on a 10.5F lead and was used as the anode. The system cathode was the electrically active 108-cm2 surface area shell (or \"can\") of a prototype titanium alloy pulse generator placed in a left infraclavicular pocket. The defibrillation pulse was derived from either a 60-microF or a 120-microF capacitance and was delivered from RV--&gt;CAN. Defibrillation threshold (DFT) stored energy, delivered energy, leading-edge voltage and current, pulse resistance, and pulse width were measured for both capacitances examined. The 60-microF capacitance biphasic pulse resulted in a stored-energy DFT of 8.5 +/- 4.1 J and a delivered-energy DFT of 8.4 +/- 4.0 J. In 34 of 38 patients (89%), the stored-energy DFT was &lt; 15 J. Leading-edge voltage at the DFT was 517 +/- 128 V. Mean pulse impedance for the 60-microF waveform was 60.6 +/- 7.1 omega. The 120-microF capacitance biphasic pulse resulted in a stored-energy DFT of 10.1 +/- 7.4 J and a delivered-energy DFT of 10.0 +/- 7.2 J (P = .13 and .13, respectively). In 28 of 38 patients (74%), the stored-energy DFT was &lt; 15 J (P = .052). Leading-edge voltage at the DFT with the 120-microF capacitance pulse was 386 +/- 142 (P &lt; .00001). Mean pulse impedance for the 120-microF waveform was 60.7 +/- 7.0 omega (P = .80). The results of the present study suggest that a relatively small capacitance, 60 microF, can be used for unipolar defibrillation systems without compromising defibrillation energy requirements compared with more typical ICD capacitance values, but this will require a higher circuit voltage. The use of lower capacitance also provides a modest increase in the percent of patients who have very low energy defibrillation requirements, an important issue should maximum ICD energy be decreased from the present level of 34 J. Such a move to smaller output devices could allow significant decreases in device size, a necessary feature of making cardioverter-defibrillator implantation comparable to that of standard pacemaker surgery.",

The peak RF power required for the pulses is well-within hard-pulse power limits for modern high resolution probes. However, in multipulse sequences, repeated application of what might be deemed a modest power level for a single pulse can be a problem if the total energy delivered to the sample (integrated power) is too high. There are also limits on the total energy that can safely be delivered to a given probe. For these reasons, the most general and widespread applications impose peak power levels that are more conservative than what might be necessary for broadband refocusing using a typical probe. We therefore incorporate a time-dependent RF limit into the optimal control algorithms to keep peak power low for most of the pulse, but allow short increases in this limit where it can have the most benefit. We utilize algorithms A T and A S,T (defined in \u00a72.1.2) to investigate the possibility of generic broadband refocusing pulses suitable for use with any standard probehead in any pulse sequence.\n\n\nThree adiabatic inversion pulses\n\nThe best broadband refocusing performance available in the standard Bruker pulse library satisfying the required conservative pulse power limits is obtained using the pulse designated Chirp80 [45]. This pulse is constructed from three adiabatic inversion pulses with pulse lengths in the ratio 1:2:1 [19]. It utilizes for its shortest element a 500 ms smoothed chirp pulse [44] with 80 kHz sweep. The first 20% of the pulse rises smoothly to a maximum constant RF amplitude of 11.26 kHz according to a sine function before decreasing in the same fashion to zero during the final 20% of the pulse. The final pulse is thus 2 ms long.\n\nMaintaining this pulse length and mindful of the given conservative peak RF amplitude, we designed the set of four pulses listed in Table 1. For most of the pulse, the nominal RF amplitude is a constant 10 or 11 kHz. A maximum RF amplitude of 15 kHz is applied for 60 \u00b5s in the middle of the pulse, as illustrated in Fig. 2. This short increase in pulse amplitude provides significant improvement in pulse performance compared to Chirp80.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the strength-duration relation for the second phase of a biphasic defibrillation waveform in humans. This was a prospective, randomized study of biphasic DFT in 36 patients; a uniform dual-coil transvenous lead system was used. In each patient, 3 DFTs were determined with the pulse duration for the second phase of the defibrillation waveform varying between 1 and 18 ms. The duration of the first phase was fixed at 6 ms and the capacitance was 150 microF. There was a significant increase in the leading edge voltage at DFT only when the second-phase pulse duration was decreased to 1 ms. There was no increase in DFT voltage even when the second-phase pulse duration was increased from 2 to 18 ms. Similar relations were observed for stored energy, leading edge current, or phase 2 energy. The normalized average current delivered during phase 2 decreased monotonically with increasing phase 2 duration. In humans, the biphasic DFT voltage or energy is increased only when the second phase of the waveform is &lt;2 ms.

To achieve the earlier response times required for survival, typically &lt; 6 minutes from time of collapse, it will be necessary to equip a far wider network of first responders (firefighters, police, and other individuals with responsibility for public safety) with small, lightweight, and inexpensive automatic external defibrillators (AEDs). An important step in reducing the size and cost of AEDs will be to improve defibrillation efficacy. Because biphasic waveform defibrillation has had a favorable impact on implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), there are reasons to believe that biphasic waveforms would also improve transthoracic defibrillators. Our purpose, therefore, was to examine the efficacy of two different low-energy biphasic truncated waveforms referenced to a standard damped sine waveform for transthoracic defibrillation in humans. We prospectively and randomly compared the transthoracic defibrillation efficacy of two different truncated biphasic waveforms, 115 J (70 microF) and 130 J (105 microF), with that of a standard 200-J (36-microF, 28-mH) damped sine wave pulse using right anterior and left lateral thoracic pads (R2 Medical Systems) in 30 cardiac arrest survivors during transvenous ICD surgery. The right anterior patch electrode was used as the cathode and the left lateral thoracic pad as the anode. Transthoracic ventricular defibrillation rescue shocks were tested after a failed transvenous defibrillation shock delivered in the course of ICD testing. Each of the three different rescue shocks was tested in random order in each patient. All shocks were delivered at end expiration. The investigators responsible for determining transthoracic shock efficacy were blinded throughout the study to the transthoracic rescue waveform used. A total of 33 patients were considered for study, but three patients failed to satisfy all entry criteria or did not have a sufficient number of ventricular fibrillation inductions to allow for testing of all three waveforms. Percent efficacy for the three waveforms was then compared in the 30 patients who satisfied entry criteria and completed the protocol. The study population had a mean age of 61 +/- 11 years, with 22 (73%) being men. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.39 +/- 0.14. Coronary artery disease was present in 22 (73%). The 115-J (70-microF) biphasic pulse, the 130-J (105-microF) biphasic pulse, and the 200-J (36-microF, 28-mH) damped sine wave pulse were equally effective, resulting in a 97% first-shock ventricular defibrillation efficacy rate. Each waveform failed to defibrillate once, with each waveform failing in a different patient. The results of this study suggest that biphasic truncated transthoracic shocks of low energy (115 and 130 J) are as effective as 200-J damped sine wave shocks used in standard transthoracic defibrillators. This finding may contribute significantly to the miniaturization and cost reduction of transthoracic defibrillators, which could enable the development of a new generation of AEDs appropriate for an expanded group of out-of-hospital first responders and, eventually, layperson use.",

This article presents a systematic study characterizing the achievable performance of these pulses as functions of bandwidth, pulse length, and tolerance to B(1)-field inhomogeneity/miscalibration. After an evaluation of different quality factors employed in pulse design algorithms based on optimal control theory, resulting pulses are discussed in detail with a special focus on pulse symmetry. The vast majority of resulting BURBOP (broadband universal rotations by optimal control) pulses are either fully symmetric or have one symmetric and one antisymmetric Cartesian rf component, where the importance of the first symmetry has not been demonstrated yet and the latter one matches the symmetry that results from a previously derived construction principle of universal rotation pulses out of point-to-point pulses [3]. Optimized BURBOP pulses are shown to perform better than previously reported UR pulses, resulting in shorter pulse durations for the same quality of broadband rotations. From a comparison of qualities of effective universal rotations, we find that the application of a single optimal refocusing pulse matches or improves the performance of two consecutive inversion pulses in INEPT-like pulse sequence elements of the same total duration.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of total pulse duration and the duration of the second (negative) phase on voltage and energy defibrillation requirements using biphasic waveforms. Defibrillation efficacy was evaluated in an isolated rabbit heart model using the Langendorff technique. The biphasic waveform was a truncated exponential with the initial voltage of the second phase equal to 50% of the final voltage of the first phase. An up/down protocol was used to determine the 50% probability-of-success levels (E50) for delivered energy and initial voltage. First, using pulse waveforms with equal positive and negative phase durations, test waveforms with total durations of 4 ms (2 ms positive + 2 ms negative), 6 ms (3 + 3 ms), and 16 ms (8 + 8 ms) were compared to the control waveform of 8 ms (4 + 4 ms) in 30 experiments. Defibrillation voltage requirements with 4 ms (174 +/- 56 V) were higher (P = 0.001) compared to 8 ms (127 +/- 49 V). Defibrillation voltage requirements for the 6-ms and 16-ms waveforms were similar to the 8-ms control waveform. Delivered energies tended to be higher with the 4-ms waveform. A second series of 40 experiments were performed to compare monophasic (4 + 0 ms) and three asymmetric biphasic waveforms (4 + 2 ms, 4 + 8 ms, and 4 + 16 ms) to the symmetric control waveform (4 + 4 ms). The monophasic (2.15 +/- 1.21 J) and the 4 + 16 ms waveform (1.86 +/- 1.09 J) required higher energies (P &lt; or = 0.05) than the control waveform (1.24 +/- 0.41 J and 0.87 +/- 0.7 J, respectively). The monophasic waveform also resulted in greater voltage requirements (223 +/- 64 V) compared to the control waveform (160 +/- 26 V) (P = 0.02). Energy and voltage requirements were similar for the 4 + 2 ms and 4 + 8 ms waveforms compared to the control. Defibrillation requirements with biphasic waveforms were affected by total and second phase duration. For waveforms with equal phase durations, total durations between 6-16 ms resulted in the lowest values for defibrillation. For waveforms with variable second (negative) phase durations, durations ranging from 50%-200% of the first phase did not affect defibrillation efficacy.",

To this end, both temporal and spatial variations of the excitation field must be taken into account in addition to the expected increase in conductivity. For all these reasons, we find the propagation of radiation at ultra high fields (&gt;4 T) new phenomena commonly observed in quantum optics but traditionally negligible in NMR such as phase modulation of the excitation field such that the identity between pulse area and flip angle is no longer valid. In this paper, the emergence of field propagation phenomena in NMR experiments is analytically and numerically demonstrated. It is shown that in addition to the well-studied dielectric resonance phenomena at high magnetic fields (&gt;4 T), field propagation effects transform the excitation pulse into an adiabatic excitation. The high field strength also mean that nonlinear effects such as self-induced transparency are now possible in NMR experiments.",

Theoretical considerations suggest, however, that improved defibrillation energy requirements may be obtained with smaller capacitance values. We compared the energy requirement for defibrillation in a porcine model using a biphasic waveform generated from two capacitance values of 140 microF and 85 microF. Phase 1 reversal of the shock waveform occurred at 65% tilt. Phase 2 pulse width was equal to phase 1. Shocks were delivered through epicardial patch electrodes after 10 seconds of induced ventricular fibrillation. The defibrillation threshold (DFT) was determined by a \"down-up\" technique requiring three reversals of defibrillation success or failure. The DFT was defined as the average of the values obtained with all trials starting from the successful shock prior to the first failure to defibrillate to the last successful defibrillation. In eight experiments, the measured parameters at DFT were as follows. The average stored and delivered DFT energies for the 85 microF capacitor were 6.1 +/- 2.1 and 6.0 +/- 2.0 J, respectively, compared to 7.5 +/- 1.3 and 7.4 +/- 1.3 J for the 140 microF capacitor (P &lt; 0.04). The phase 1 pulse widths were significantly shorter for the 85 microF capacitor (5.1 +/- 0.8 msec vs 9.2 +/- 1.3 msec) and the impedances were lower (54.4 +/- 5.8 omega vs 59.9 +/- 6.3 omega). The mean leading edge voltage was trending higher for the 85 microF capacitor, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (374 +/- 63 V vs 326 +/- 30 V; P = 0.055). Smaller capacitance values do result in lower energy requirements for the biphasic waveform, at a possibly higher leading edge voltage and a much shorter pulse width. Smaller capacitance values could represent a significant enhancement of well-established benefits demonstrated with the biphasic waveform.",

Alternative waveforms for transthoracic defibrillation may improve shock success. First, we determined the shock success achieved by three different waveforms at varying energies (18-150 J) in 21 mongrel dogs after short-duration ventricular fibrillation. The waveforms tested included the traditional damped sinusoidal waveform, a single pathway biphasic waveform, and a new encircling overlapping multipulse waveform delivered from six electrode pads oriented circumferentially. Second, in 11 swine we compared the efficacy of encircling overlapping multipulse shocks given from six electrode pads and three capacitors versus encircling overlapping shocks given from a device utilizing three electrodes and one capacitor. In the first experiment, the encircling overlapping waveform performed significantly better than biphasic and damped sinusoidal waveforms at lower energies. The shock success rate of the overlapping waveform (six pads) ranged from 67+/-4% (at 18-49 J energy) to 99+/-3% at &gt; or = 150 J; at comparable energies biphasic waveform shock success ranged from 26+/-5% (p &lt; 0.01 vs. encircling overlapping waveforms) to 99+/-5% (p = NS).

In the second experiment the three electrode pads, one capacitor encircling waveform achieved shock success rates comparable with the six-pad, three-capacitor waveform; at 18-49 J, success rates were 45+/-15% versus 57+/-12%, respectively (p = NS). At 100 J, success rates for both were 100%. We conclude that encircling overlapping multipulse multipathway waveforms facilitate transthoracic defibrillation at low energies.

Based on the success with biphasic shock waveform in converting ventricular fibrillation, it was postulated that biphasic shocks would allow cardioversion with lower energy. In a international multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of 203 patients, damped sine wave monophasic shocks were compared with impedance-compensated truncated exponential biphasic waveform shocks. Patients received up to five shocks: 100 J, 150 J, 200 J, a fourth shock at maximum output for the initial waveform (200 J biphasic, 360 J monophasic) and a final cross-over shock at maximum output of the alternate waveform. For each energy level, the biphasic waveform compared favorably to the monophasic waveform in successful cardioversion (100 J: 60% versus 22%, P &lt; 0.0001; 150 J: 77% versus 44%, p &lt; 0.0001; 200 J: 90% versus 53%, p &lt; 0.0001). Success with 200 J biphasic was equivalent to 360 J monophasic shock (91% versus 85%, p = 0.29). Patients randomized to biphasic waveform required fewer shocks and lower total energy delivered; in addition, this waveform was associated with less dermal injury and no blistering. Biphasic shocks converted AF present for less than 48 hours with 80% efficacy, but conversion of AF present for more than 48 hours and more than 1 year the success rate was only 63 and 20%, respectively. The results of this study is similar to other investigations comparing biphasic and monophasic shock waveforms for conversion of atrial fibrillation. We recommend starting with biphasic energy of 100 J for atrial fibrillation of less than 48 hours duration, but using higher energies (150 J, 200 J or greater) when AF has been present for longer periods.",

The ULV can be determined with a single episode of ventricular fibrillation and is more reproducible than the single-point DFT. The critical-point hypothesis of defibrillation predicts that the relation between the ULV and the DFT is independent of shock waveform. The principal goal of this study was to test this prediction. We studied 45 patients at implants of pectoral cardioverter defibrillators. In the monophasic-biphasic group (n = 15), DFT and ULV were determined for monophasic and biphasic pulses from a 120-microF capacitor. In the 60- to 110-microF group (n = 30), DFT and ULV were compared for a clinically used 110-microF waveform and a novel 60-microF waveform with 70% phase 1 tilt and 7-msec phase 2 duration.

The relation between ULV and DFT is independent of shock waveform. Fewer patients are required to detect a moderate difference in efficacy of defibrillation waveforms by ULV than by DFT.

The TeO(2)-target technology and dry distillation method of radioiodine separation were used. The removal of radioiodine was studied as a function of time and the loss of TeO(2) from the target as a function of oven temperature and time of distillation. A distillation time of 15 min at 750 degrees C was found to be ideal. Using a very pure source and comparing the intensities of the annihilation and X-ray radiation, a value of 22.0 +/- 0.5% for the beta(+) branching in 124I was obtained. Production of 124I was done using 200 mg/cm(2) targets of 99.8% enriched 124TeO(2) on Pt-backing, 16 MeV proton beam intensities of 10 microA, and irradiation times of about 8 h. The average yield of 124I at EOB was 470 MBq(12.7 mCi). At the time of application (about 70 h after EOB) the radionuclidic impurity 123I (T(1/2) = 13.2 h) was &lt;1%. The levels of other impurities were negligible (126I &lt; 0.0001%;125I = 0.01%). Special care was taken to determine the 125I impurity. For the production of (120g)I only a thin 30 mg target (on 0.5 cm(2) area) of 99.9% enriched 120TeO(2) was available. Irradiations were done with 16 MeV protons for 80 min at beam currents of 7 microA. The 120gI yield achieved at EOB was 700 MBq(19 mCi), and the only impurity detected was the isomeric state 120 mI(T(1/2) = 53 min) at a level of 4.0%. The radiochemical purity of both 124I and 120gI was checked via HPLC and TLC. The radioiodine collected in 0.02 M NaOH solution existed &gt;98% as iodide. The amount of inactive Te found in radioiodine was &lt;1 microg. High purity 124I and 120gI can thus be advantageously produced on a medium scale using the low-energy (p,n) reaction at a small-sized cyclotron.",

Relativistic effects influence the electronic structure of heavy elements in the sixth row of the periodic table, and these effects increase dramatically in the seventh row--including the actinides--even affecting ground-state configurations. Atomic s and p1/2 orbitals are stabilized by relativistic effects, whereas p3/2, d and f orbitals are destabilized, so that ground-state configurations of heavy elements may differ from those of lighter elements in the same group. The first ionization potential (IP1) is a measure of the energy required to remove one valence electron from a neutral atom, and is an atomic property that reflects the outermost electronic configuration. Precise and accurate experimental determination of IP1 gives information on the binding energy of valence electrons, and also, therefore, on the degree of relativistic stabilization. However, such measurements are hampered by the difficulty in obtaining the heaviest elements on scales of more than one atom at a time. Here we report that the experimentally obtained IP1 of the heaviest actinide, lawrencium (Lr, atomic number 103), is 4.96(+0.08)(-0.07) electronvolts. The IP1 of Lr was measured with (256)Lr (half-life 27 seconds) using an efficient surface ion-source and a radioisotope detection system coupled to a mass separator. The measured IP1 is in excellent agreement with the value of 4.963(15) electronvolts predicted here by state-of-the-art relativistic calculations. The present work provides a reliable benchmark for theoretical calculations and also opens the way for IP1 measurements of superheavy elements (that is, transactinides) on an atom-at-a-time scale.",

This discrepancy casts doubts on the DS86 neutron source term and, consequently, the survivors' estimated neutron doses. However, the doses were caused mainly by fast neutrons. To determine retrospectively fast neutron fluences in Hiroshima, the reaction 63Cu(n, p)63Ni can be used, if adequate copper samples can be found. Measuring 63Ni (half life 100 y) in Hiroshima samples requires a very sensitive technique, such as accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), because of the relatively small amounts of 63Ni expected (approximately 10(5)-10(6) atoms per gram of copper). Experiments performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have demonstrated in 1996 that AMS can be used to measure 63Ni in Hiroshima copper samples. Subsequently, a collaboration was established with the Technical University of Munich in view of its potential to perform more sensitive measurements of 63Ni than the Livermore facility and in the interest of interlaboratory validation. This paper presents the progress made at the Munich facility in the measurement of 63Ni by AMS. The Munich accelerator mass spectrometry facility is a combination of a high energy tandem accelerator and a detection system featuring a gas-filled magnet. It is designed for high sensitivity measurements of long-lived radioisotopes. Optimization of the ion source setup has further improved the sensitivity for 63Ni by reducing the background level of the 63Cu isobar interference by about two orders of magnitude. Current background levels correspond to a ratio of 63Ni/Ni&lt;2x10(-14) and suggest that, with adequate copper samples, the assessment of fast neutron fluences in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is possible for ground distances of up to 1500 m, and--under favorable conditions--even beyond. To demonstrate this capability, we have measured successfully 6Ni/Ni ratios as low as (3.5 +/- 0.6) x 10(-13). The latter are, based on DS86, representative of a ratio expected from a typical Hiroshima copper sample at about 1,300-m ground range.",

What the latter does offer is a semiquantitative a priori estimate of the importance of scalar relativistic corrections.\n\nThere is, alas, one notable, clear-cut relativistic effect that a model based on only q s (Z) is intrinsically unable to capture: the scalar relativistic correction to atomic electron affinities [10][11][12] (which for B-F and Al-Cl basically corresponds to the effect of an extra p electron). Since the p parameters for the first row are ill-determined statistically, one could instead assign fixed values from the calculated contributions to electron affinities, ionisation potentials or their average -the latter corresponds [65] to the Mulliken electronegativity except for a constant.\n\nWe As can be seen in Table 2, this model captures 99.3% of variance for the first row and 99.0% for both rows (with SF 6 omitted). It should be noted that the ratio between s and p coefficients for a given element grows with Z from about a factor of 2-15: hence, clamping the p coefficients rather than fitting them does not greatly impact accuracy. As also shown in Table 2, the SSQ recovery for both rows can be increased to 99.2% by adding d parameters; if the outlier point SF 6 is brought back in, we are back at 98.7%. These parameters are not statistically welldetermined, however, and we have chosen to omit them in deference to Occam's law of parsimony.\n\nWith NBO-based charges, things are not as simple. We can recover 99.5% for the first row, but for both rows together, this drops to just 92.2% -deleting HClO 4 and SF 6 as outliers brings us back to 95.2%, which can be lifted up to 98.0% even with HClO 4 included if a q d (Z) term is added.",

That interval of energies does not have, in principle, any physical reason to be so well defined, and gives a large amount of the total contribution to sigmad, e.g., close to 98% of it. Then a further study is given in this article, where we show some of the main characteristics of that interval of energy, such as its universal appearance and basis set independence. Our main result is the finding that sigmad is completely described by that interval of excitation energies, i.e., there is no contribution arising from outside of it. Most of the contributions belonging to that interval arise from virtual electronic energies larger than -3mc2. For heavier atoms, there are few contributions from states with virtual negative energies smaller than -3mc2. The model systems under study were noble gases, XH (X=Br, I, and At), XH2 (X=O, S, Se, Te, and Po), XH3 (X=N, P, As, Sb, and Bi); XH4 (X=Sn and Pb), and SnXH3 (X=Br and I). The pattern of contributions of occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) is also shown, where the 1s1/2 is the most important for excitations ending in the bottom half part of the above mentioned interval. On the other hand, the contribution of the other occupied MOs are more important than that of 1s1/2 for the other part of such interval. We also show that sigmad is electron correlation independent within both relativistic and nonrelativistic domain. In the case of sigmap, we find out a clear dependence of electron correlation effects with relativistic effects, which is of the order of 30% for Pb in PbH4.",

Variation in Covalent Radius - \nAs shown in Figure 3.31, as we move across a period from left to right, we generally find that each element has a smaller covalent radius than the element preceding it. This might seem counterintuitive because it implies that atoms with more electrons have a smaller atomic radius. This can be explained with the concept of effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$. This is the pull exerted on a specific electron by the nucleus, taking into account any electron-electron repulsions. For hydrogen, there is only one electron and so the nuclear charge ( $Z$ ) and the effective nuclear charge ( $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ ) are equal. For all other atoms, the inner electrons partially shield the outer electrons from the pull of the nucleus, and thus:\n\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}}=Z-\\text { shielding }\n$$\n\nShielding is determined by the probability of another electron being between the electron of interest and the nucleus, as well as by the electron-electron repulsions the electron of interest encounters. Core electrons are adept at shielding, while electrons in the same valence shell do not block the nuclear attraction experienced by each other as efficiently. Thus, each time we move from one element to the next across a period, $Z$ increases by one, but the shielding increases only slightly. Thus, $Z_{\\text {eff }}$ increases as we move from left to right across a period. The stronger pull (higher effective nuclear charge) experienced by electrons on the right side of the periodic table draws them closer to the nucleus, making the covalent radii smaller.\n\nThus, as we would expect, the outermost or valence electrons are easiest to remove because they have the highest energies, are shielded more, and are farthest from the nucleus. As a general rule, when the representative elements form cations, they do so by the loss of the $n s$ or $n p$ electrons that were added last in the Aufbau process. The transition elements, on the other hand, lose the $n s$ electrons before they begin to lose the ( $n-1$ )d electrons, even though the $n s$ electrons are added first, according to the Aufbau principle.",

Besides the radiation action of these electrons, Coulomb explosion is suspected to be an additional mechanism responsible for the strong radiotoxic effect of decaying DNA-incorporated 125I. The two-step decay process initiates a first Auger cascade within 10(-16) to 10(-14) s resulting in the release of about 7 electrons on average and a corresponding large positive charge on the 125Te daughter atom. Being part of iododeoxyuridine (125IUdR), the analogue of the DNA base thymine, the base is suddenly confronted with this charge. Experimentally, the situation was investigated with small molecules (CH3(125)I and C2H5(125)I) resulting in ion fragmentation in agreement with a Coulomb explosion model (Carlson and White, 1963, 1966). Semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations on the Parametric Method 3 (PM3) level (Stewart, 1989a, 1989b) were performed and geometry optimisation was applied for the identification of stable molecule conformations. Subsequently, semiempirical molecular dynamics simulations allowed changes in the conformations to be studied as a function of time. First results show that there is no stable molecular configuration with a total charge of &gt; or = +5e. PM3 calculations will not converge for such a charge located at the 125I/125Te position. This finding is supported by total energy considerations, which begin to favour a system of isolated atoms versus molecular bound atoms when the molecular charge is greater than +4e. The distribution of the partial charges indicates that most of the charge will remain on the tellurium atom with slight increases of charge at the other molecular partners within 125IUdR. Moreover, the molecular dynamics simulations reveal a breaking of chemical bonds between those atoms with the strongest charge increase. Coulomb explosion must be taken into account as a possible damaging mechanism following the decay of DNA-incorporated Auger electron emitters. Lobachevsky and Martin (2000) have identified the same mechanism to be responsible for part of strand breakage in oligo-deoxynucleotides. To elucidate a possible link between both damage patterns the molecular mechanics simulations have to be extended to larger parts of the DNA molecule.",

As the case of the nuclear shell model demonstrated, it might be interesting to have a look at the answers that theoretical chemists give to predict the chemical properties of superheavy elements. Traditionally, the chemical properties of an unknown element and its compounds were predicted by exploiting the fundamental relationships of the physicochemical data of the elements and their compounds within the groups and the periods of the Periodic Table. However, with the increasing nuclear charges in heavy elements, the innermost electrons become more tightly bound and are thus moving with velocities which are a considerable fraction of the speed of light. Therefore they obey the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics. Due to relativistic rearrangements, which are predicted for the electronic structure of the heaviest elements, quite unexpected chemical properties are to be expected. These so-called relativistic effects are already severely influencing the chemical properties of lighter elements such as gold. The yellow color and the rather inert chemical behavior can be attributed to relativistic effects and explained by fully relativistic quantum chemical calculations. [17] Early predictions of the chemical properties of superheavy elements were rather spectacular. One of the articles was entitled 'Are elements 112, 114, and 118 relatively inert gases?'. [18] Nowadays, with the use of powerful supercomputers the accuracy of quantum chemical calculations is increasing rapidly. Latest calculations come to the conclusion that element 112 (Cn) is not completely inert as expected for a noble gas, but should form a chemical bond with Au, which, however, is weaker than that of the lighter homolog Hg. [19] Also, element 114 might be relatively inert but should interact stronger with an Au surface than Cn. [19] Element 118 is predicted to be the first element in the row of noble gases with an electron affinity. [20] Due to the considerable experimental difficulties in experimentally studying the chemical properties of superheavy elements, the gap between experimental observables and theoretical predictions is still large.",

This mixed valence cluster compound is used in an effort to develop a reusable in situ battery cell that is suitable for such long-term performance tests. The Mn12tPe MCBs exhibit a large capacity of approximately 210\u2005Ah\u2009kg(-1) in the voltage range V=4.0-2.0\u2005V. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra exhibit a systematic change during the charging/discharging with an isosbestic point at 6555\u2005eV, which strongly suggests that only either the Mn(3+) or Mn(4+) ions in the Mn12 skeleton are involved in this battery reaction. The averaged manganese valence, determined from the absorption-edge energy, decreased monotonically from 3.3 to 2.5 in the first half of the discharging (4.0&gt;V&gt;2.8\u2005V), but changed little in the second half (2.8&gt;V&gt;2.0\u2005V). The former valence change indicates a reduction of the initial [Mn12](0) state by approximately ten electrons, which corresponds well with the half value of the observed capacity. Therefore, the large capacity of the Mn12 MCBs can be understood as being due to a combination of the redox change of the manganese ions and presumably a capacitance effect. The extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) indicates a gradual increase of the Mn(2+) sites in the first half of the discharging, which is consistent with the XANES spectra. It can be concluded that the Mn12tPe MCBs would include a solid-state electrochemical reaction, mainly between the neutral state [Mn12](0) and the super-reduced state [Mn12](8-) that is obtained by a local reduction of the eight Mn(3+) ions in Mn12 toward Mn(2+) ions.",

The proton beam was also shielded with thick (about 20 g/cm2) blocks of lucite (PMMA) or aluminium (Al). We found that the dose rate was increased 40-60% by the shielding and decreased as a function of the distance along the axis. Simulations using the General-Purpose Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport code System (PHITS) show that the dose increase is mostly caused by secondary protons emitted by the target. The modified radiation field after the shield has been characterized for its biological effectiveness by measuring chromosomal aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed just behind the shield block, or to the direct beam, in the dose range 0.5-3 Gy. Notwithstanding the increased dose per incident proton, the fraction of aberrant cells at the same dose in the sample position was not significantly modified by the shield. The PHITS code simulations show that, albeit secondary protons are slower than incident nuclei, the LET spectrum is still contained in the low-LET range (&lt;10 keV/microm), which explains the approximately unitary value measured for the relative biological effectiveness.",

This led to a reorganization of the periodic table, with chemical elements now arranged on the basis of atomic number Z rather than atomic weight A, as had been the case in previous tables, including those developed by Mendeleev. Moseley also showed that there were four 'missing elements' before gold. With further measurements up to uranium Z\u2009=\u200992, the Swedish physicist Manne Siegbahn identified two more missing elements. This paper provides an introduction to Moseley and his experiments and then traces attempts to 'discover' missing elements by X-ray spectroscopy. There were two successes with hafnium (Z\u2009=\u200972) and rhenium (Z\u2009=\u200975), but many blind alleys and episodes of self-deception when dealing with elements 43, 61, 85 and 87. These all turned out to be radioactive, with extremely small natural abundances: all required synthesis by a nuclear reaction, with radiological characterization in the first instance. Finally, the paper moves on to consider the role of X-ray spectroscopy in exploring the periodic table beyond uranium. Although the discovery of artificial radioactive elements with Z\u2009&gt;\u200992 again depended on nucleosynthesis and radiological characterization, measurement of the frequencies or energies of characteristic X-rays remains the ultimate goal in proving the existence of an element.

Extrapolation to the one-particle basis set limit was performed and core correlation and scalar relativistic contributions were included directly, while the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction was added. Our best purely ab initio PES, denoted \"mixed,\" is constructed from two PESs which differ in whether the ic-ACPF higher-order correlation correction was added or not. Rovibrational transition energies computed from the mixed PES agree well with experiment and the best previous theoretical studies, but most importantly the quality does not deteriorate even up to 10 300 cm(-1) above the zero-point energy (ZPE). The mixed PES was improved further by empirical refinement using the most reliable J=0-2 rovibrational transitions in the HITRAN 2004 database. Agreement between high-resolution experiment and rovibrational transition energies computed from our refined PES for J=0-6 is excellent. Indeed, the root mean square (rms) error for 13 HITRAN 2004 bands for J=0-2 is 0.023 cm(-1) and that for each band is always &lt;or=0.06 cm(-1). For J=3-5 the rms error is always &lt;or=0.15 cm(-1).

The ab initio calculations are done at the multireference configuration interaction+Davidson correction (MRCI+Q) level of theory by complete basis set extrapolation of the aug-cc-pVnZ (n=2,3,4) energies. Due to low-lying charge transfer states in the transition state region, the molecular orbitals are obtained by six-state dynamically weighted multichannel self-consistent field methods. Additional perturbative refinement of the energies is achieved by implementing simple one-parameter correlation energy scaling to reproduce the experimental exothermicity (DeltaE=-33.06 kcalmol) for the reaction. Ab initio points are fitted to an analytical function based on sum of two- and three-body contributions, yielding a rms deviation of &lt;0.3 kcalmol for all geometries below 10 kcalmol above the barrier. Of particular relevance to nonadiabatic dynamics, the calculations show significant multireference character in the transition state region, which is located 3.8 kcalmol with respect to F+HCl reactants and features a strongly bent F-H-Cl transition state geometry (theta approximately 123.5 degrees ). Finally, the surface also exhibits two conical intersection seams that are energetically accessible at low collision energies. These seams arise naturally from allowed crossings in the C(infinityv) linear configuration that become avoided in C(s) bent configurations of both the reactant and product, and should be a hallmark of all X-H-Y atom transfer reaction dynamics between ((2)P) halogen atoms.",

The Ca+HCl--&gt;CaCl+H reaction is endothermic by 5100 cm(-1) with a barrier of 4470 cm(-1) at bent geometry, taking the zero energy in the Ca+HCl asymptote. On both sides of this barrier are potential wells at linear geometries, a shallow one due to van der Waals interactions in the entrance channel, and a deep one attributed to the H(-)Ca(++)Cl(-) ionic configuration. The accuracy of the van der Waals well depth, approximately 200 cm(-1), was checked by means of additional calculations at the coupled-cluster singles and doubles with perturbative triples level and it was concluded that previous empirical estimates are unrealistic. Also, the electric dipole function was calculated, analytically fitted in the regions of the two wells, and used to analyze the charge shifts along the reaction path. In the insertion well, 16,800 cm(-1) deep, the electric dipole function confirmed the ionic structure of the HCaCl complex and served to estimate effective atomic charges. Finally, bound rovibrational levels were computed both in the van der Waals well and in the insertion well, and the infrared-absorption spectrum of the insertion complex was simulated in order to facilitate its detection.",

The calculations were performed at the second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) and the coupled cluster including singles, doubles, and a perturbative estimate of triples replacement [CCSD(T)] levels of electronic structure theory. At both levels of theory, by including results corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), we have estimated the complete basis set (CBS) limit by employing the family of Dunning's correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets. The largest MP2 calculation was performed with the cc-pV6Z basis set (2772 basis functions), whereas the largest CCSD(T) calculation was with the cc-pV5Z basis set (1752 basis functions). The cluster geometries were optimized with basis sets up to quadruple-\u03b6 quality, observing that both its intra- and intermolecular parts have practically converged with the triple-\u03b6 quality sets. The use of converged geometries was found to play an important role for obtaining accurate estimates for the CBS limits. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies with the families of the plain (cc-pVnZ) and augmented (aug-cc-pVnZ) sets converge [within &lt;0.01 kcal/mol for MP2 and &lt;0.15 kcal/mol for CCSD(T)] to the same CBS limit. In addition, the average of the uncorrected and BSSE-corrected binding energies was found to converge to the same CBS limit much faster than either of the two constituents (uncorrected or BSSE-corrected binding energies). Due to the fact that the family of augmented basis sets (especially for the larger sets) causes serious linear dependency problems, the plain basis sets (for which no linear dependencies were found) are deemed as a more efficient and straightforward path for obtaining an accurate CBS limit. We considered extrapolations of the uncorrected (\u0394E) and BSSE-corrected (\u0394Ecp) binding energies, their average value (\u0394Eave), as well as the average of the latter over the plain and augmented sets (\u0394\u1ebcave) with the cardinal number of the basis set n. Our best estimate of the CCSD(T)/CBS limit for the \u03c0-\u03c0 binding energy in the PD benzene dimer is De = -2.65 \u00b1 0.02 kcal/mol. The best CCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z calculated value is -2.62 kcal/mol, just 0.03 kcal/mol away from the CBS limit. For comparison, the MP2/CBS limit estimate is -5.00 \u00b1 0.01 kcal/mol, demonstrating a 90% overbinding with respect to CCSD(T). The spin-component-scaled (SCS) MP2 variant was found to closely reproduce the CCSD(T) results for each basis set, while scaled opposite spin (SOS) MP2 yielded results that are too low when compared to CCSD(T).

The total energy of HgBr(2) was calculated by the multireference configuration interaction level of theory with series of correlation consistent basis sets up to quadruple-zeta quality with subsequent extrapolation to the complete basis set limit. An additive correction for spin-orbit coupling was also included. The global PES was represented piecewise by interpolating three separate parts of the surface with the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method and connecting them smoothly by switch functions. Quasiclassical trajectory calculations carried out on the surface yielded 298 K thermal rate constants of 3.89 x 10(-11) cm(3)/(mol.s) for the abstraction reaction HgBr + Br --&gt; Hg + Br(2), 2.98 x 10(-11) cm(3)/(mol.s) for the recombination reaction Br + HgBr --&gt; HgBr(2), and 3.97 x 10(-11) cm(3)/(mol.s) for the exchange reaction Br + HgBr --&gt; BrHg + Br. The insertion reaction Hg + Br(2) --&gt; HgBr(2) was found to have a high barrier of 27.2 kcal/mol and a very small rate constant of just 2.74 x 10(-31) cm(3)/(mol.s) determined by the microcanonical variational transition state theory method. The implications of the obtained results to the description of the mechanism of recently observed polar tropospheric mercury depletion events are briefly discussed.",

The branching ratio for CH2O*- + CH3Cl on improved potential energy surfaces.\nThe reaction of formaldehyde radical anion with methyl chloride, CH2O*- + CH3Cl, is an example in which a single transition state leads to two products: substitution at carbon (Sub(C), CH3CH2O* + Cl-) and electron transfer (ET, CH2O + CH3* + Cl-). The branching ratio for this reaction has been studied by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). The energies of transition states and intermediates were computed at a variety of levels of theory and compared to accurate energetics calculated by the G3 and CBS-QB3 methods. A bond additivity correction has been constructed to improve the Hartree-Fock potential energy surface (BAC-UHF). A satisfactory balance between good energetics and affordable AIMD calculations can be achieved with BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) and BAC-UHF/6-31G(d) calculations. Approximately 200 ab initio classical trajectories were calculated for each level of theory with initial conditions sampled from a thermal distribution at 298 K at the transition state. Three types of trajectories were distinguished: trajectories that go directly to ET product, trajectories that go to Sub(C) product, and trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley and then dissociate to ET products. The BH&amp;HLYP/6-31G(d) calculations overestimate the number of nonreactive and direct ET trajectories because the transition state is too early. For the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods, about one-third of the trajectories that initially go into the Sub(C) valley dissociate to ET products, compared to just over half with UHF/6-31G(d) in the earlier study. This difference can be attributed to a better value for the calculated energy release from the initial transition state and to an improved Sub(C) --&gt; ET barrier height with the BH&amp;HLYP and BAC-UHF methods.",

The geometries and frequencies of the stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES) are optimized at the B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory, and the energies are refined at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) (single-point) level of theory. Basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrections are applied to obtain 1.5 kcal mol(-1) for the binding energy of the ClO.N(2) van der Waals (VDW) complex. A model PES is developed and used in quasi-classical trajectory calculations to obtain the capture rate constant and nascent energy distributions of ClOOCl* produced via the chaperon mechanism. A range of VDW binding energies from 1.5 to 9.0 kcal mol(-1) are investigated. The anisotropic PES for the ClO.N(2) complex and a separable anharmonic oscillator approximation are used to estimate the equilibrium constant for formation of the VDW complex. Rate constants, branching ratios to produce ClOOCl, and nascent energy distributions of excited ClOOCl* are discussed with respect to the VDW binding energy and temperature. Interestingly, even for weak VDW binding energies, the N(2) usually carries away enough energy to stabilize the nascent ClOOCl*, although the VDW equilibrium constant is small. For stronger binding energies, the stabilization efficiency is reduced, but the capture rate constant is increased commensurately. The resulting rate constants for forming ClOOCl* from the title reaction are only weakly dependent on the VDW binding energy and temperature. As a result, the relative importance of the chaperon mechanism is mostly dependent on the VDW equilibrium constant. For the calculated ClO.N(2) binding energy of 1.5 kcal mol(-1), the VDW equilibrium constant is small, and the chaperon mechanism is only important at very high pressures.",

The stationary points of the ground-state potential energy surface have been characterized using various electronic-structure methods and basis sets. Our best calculations, CCSD(T) extrapolated to the complete basis limit, using geometries and harmonic frequencies obtained at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level, are in agreement with the experimental reaction energy. Ab initio information has been used to reparameterize a semiempirical Hamiltonian so that the predictions of the improved Hamiltonian agree with the higher-level calculations in key regions of the potential energy surface. The improved semiempirical Hamiltonian is then used to propagate quasiclassical trajectories. Computed kinetic energy release and scattering angle distributions at a collision energy of approximately 5.5 kcal mol(-1) are in reasonable agreement with experiments, but no evidence was found for the low translational energy HCl products scattered in the backward hemisphere reported in recent experiments.",

Obviously, the melting temperature at zero pressure and at the pressure of one bar differ somewhat. In fact, for real water the difference is about 0.01 K (i.e. 273.16 K for essentially zero pressure at the triple point versus 273.15 K for p \u00bc 1 bar). For water models, the difference between the melting pressure at zero pressure and at p \u00bc 1 bar is expected to be of the order of 1=\u00f0dp=dT\u00de. By using the values of dp=dT reported in our previous work [48] it can be seen that also for water models the difference between the melting temperatures at normal pressure and zero pressure should be of the order of about 0.01 K (i.e. quite small). In view of that, it is reasonable to identify T m with T s . Still another comment is required with respect to our simulations of the ice-vacuum interface. In principle, when ice is exposed to vacuum at temperatures below the melting point there should be a solid-vapour equilibria. The vapour pressure of water at the triple point is quite low, namely 6 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 bar. The vapour pressure of TIP4P models at the triple point is fifty times smaller [36], about 1:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 bar. Although in principle one could determine the vapour pressure of ice by performing NVT runs of ice in contact with vacuum, this is not feasible in practice. In fact, for the lengths of the runs used in this paper we have never observed the sublimation of a single ice molecule into the vacuum (this of course should occur in very long runs, but since it is a rare event it was not observed in the runs of this work which lasted about 10 ns). For this reason we prefer to say that T s was obtained at zero pressure, but it could be more appropriate to say that it was obtained at the sublimation pressure of the ice (which must be quite low anyway).",

Isothermal measurements of G(T) are also made for 126 K \u2264 T \u2264 151 K.

The fact that G(T) and D(T) are smoothly varying rules out the hypothesis that liquid water's properties have a singularity at or near 228 K at ambient pressures. However, the results are consistent with a previous prediction for D(T) that assumed no thermodynamic transitions occur in no man's land.",

The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40,000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7 x 10(-4) g/cm3.",

Mishima 109,110 determined the course of the melting curve in the range where ice I is metastable. Equation (36) was used to calculate the melting curve in this range by extrapolating both the equation of state of ice and of that of supercooled water. Figure 27 shows that the calculated melting curve agrees fairly well with Mishima's data. Figure 28 shows deviations of the experimental data from values computed from Eq. (36). The data from Henderson and Speedy 106 are the most accurate and differ less than 1 MPa from Eq. (36). The data of Maruyama 108 systematically lie 2 MPa below Eq. (36). The maximum pressure difference in the stable region between Eq. (36) and values from the IAPWS correlation 41 is 0.6%, which is well within the uncertainty of 2% of the IAPWS correlation.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have developed an equation of state for cold and supercooled water, explicit in the Gibbs energy, valid from the homogeneous nucleation temperature to 300 K and for pressures up to 400 MPa. The equation is based on a two-state model of water, combined with empirical background terms. It is the first equation of state that represents the density data of Sotani et al. 35 and Asada et al. 37 as well as the speed-of-sound data of Lin and Trusler 52 in the considered temperature range. In part of the stable region of liquid water, the equation can be connected to the IAPWS-95 formulation with minimal discontinuities in the property values.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of future equations of state, density measurements with an accuracy of 0.02% or better below 250 K up to 400 MPa are desirable. Currently, this area is only covered by Mishima's data. For the speed of sound, there are only a few measurements in the metastable region for pressures higher than atmospheric. Experimental data are needed especially down to 250 K and up to 200 MPa. Also, there are no data for the heat capacity of supercooled water above atmospheric pressure, while such data are highly desirable.",

Experimental studies.\nWe report a detailed experimental study of (i) pressure-induced transformations in glycerol-water mixtures at T = 77 K and P = 0-1.8 GPa, and (ii) heating-induced transformations of glycerol-water mixtures recovered at 1 atm and T = 77 K. Our samples are prepared by cooling the solutions at ambient pressure at various cooling rates (100 K s(-1)-10 K h(-1)) and for the whole range of glycerol mole fractions, \u03c7(g). Depending on concentration and cooling rates, cooling leads to samples containing amorphous ice (\u03c7g \u2265 0.20), ice (\u03c7(g) \u2264 0.32), and/or \"distorted ice\" (0 &lt; \u03c7(g) \u2264 0.38). Upon compression, we find that (a) fully vitrified samples at \u03c7(g) \u2265 0.20 do not show glass polymorphism, in agreement with previous works; (b) samples containing ice show pressure-induced amorphization (PIA) leading to the formation of high-density amorphous ice (HDA). PIA of ice domains within the glycerol-water mixtures is shown to be possible only up to \u03c7(g) \u2248 0.32 (T = 77 K). This is rather surprising since it has been known that at \u03c7(g) &lt; 0.38, cooling leads to phase-separated samples with ice and maximally freeze-concentrated solution of \u03c7(g) \u2248 0.38. Accordingly, in the range 0.32 &lt; \u03c7(g) &lt; 0.38, we suggest that the water domains freeze into an interfacial ice, i.e., a highly-distorted form of layered ice, which is unable to transform to HDA upon compression. Upon heating samples recovered at 1 atm, we observe a rich phase behavior. Differential scanning calorimetry indicates that only at \u03c7(g) \u2264 0.15, the water domains within the sample exhibit polyamorphism, i.e., the HDA-to-LDA (low-density amorphous ice) transformation. At 0.15 &lt; \u03c7(g) \u2264 0.38, samples contain ice, interfacial ice, and/or HDA domains. All samples (\u03c7(g) \u2264 0.38) show: the crystallization of amorphous ice domains, followed by the glass transition of the vitrified glycerol-water domains and, finally, the melting of ice at high temperatures. Our work exemplifies the complex \"phase\" behavior of glassy binary mixtures due to phase-separation (ice formation) and polyamorphism, and the relevance of sample preparation, concentration as well as cooling rates. The presence of the distorted ice (called \"interphase\" by us) also explains the debated \"drift anomaly\" upon melting. These results are compatible with the high-pressure study by Suzuki and Mishima indicating disappearance of polyamorphism at P \u2248 0.03-0.05 GPa at \u03c7(g) \u2248 0.12-0.15 [J. Chem.

Still, the contributions of entropic effects and temperature decide which isomers contribute to the molecular properties in a temperature range of interest. Notably, neither the helix-type structure reported by Guo et al. [26] nor the putative global minimum found in this study, also reported by Ya\u00f1ez et al. [56] at a high level of theory, is the putative global minimum when we consider the entropy. Our results show that the entropic-temperature effect should be considered.

Figure 3b shows four solid-solid transformation temperature points, T ss1 , T ss2 , T ss3 , and T ss4 , without Grimme's dispersion (D3). For ease of numerical of comparison, they are displayed in parentheses in Table 4 together with the probability of occurrence in bold and square brackets. The T ss1 and T ss2 points shift on the temperature axis to a higher temperature by 10 and 20 K, respectively, whereas the relative population has variations not larger than 1.5%. The T ss3 , T ss4 , and T ss5 shift on the temperature axis to low temperatures. Initially, this suggests that the dispersion of the relative population indicates a shift of the two dominant T ss points from low to higher temperatures, keeping the relative populations near-constant. In contrast with the T ss points, with lower probability occurrence, T ss points shows a small shift from high to lower temperatures with minimal changes in the relative population. The real properties in a molecule are statistical averages over the ensemble of isomers. Thus, it is crucial to, as far as possible, completely sample the potential energy surface to consider all isomers. The search for low-energy structures is not straightforward, and it could often lead to missing some low-energy isomers. In this respect, we ask what would happen if a low-energy structure was missing when computing the relative populations and the effect on the computation of any molecular properties. Figure 4 shows the computed relative population when the two coaxial triple-layered C s and C 2v structures have been removed from the isomers pool database. In the range from 773 to 1500 K, the relative population depicted by the solid yellow line in Figure 4 indicates that the dominant structure is a distorted coaxial triple-layered structure, as depicted in Figure A2(10), located 9.20 kcal/mol above the putative global minimum at the CCSD(T) level of theory. Furthermore, the analysis of the results on the average B-B bond length shown in Figure 2 indicated that the structure with the second-lowest bond length also has the same distorted coaxial triple-layered structure.

At a temperature of 2500 K, the dissociation processes are stronger, and more beryllium atoms are escaped (see the movies in the Supplementary Information). Min Li et al.

It can be seen as a measure of how dispersed the electronic polarisation is, both in real space and among the energy states. Thus, a polarisation that leads to a wide electron density reshuffling would exhibit a large entropy. We stress that only static polarisation is considered here, i.e. the case of entropy of electromagnetic polarisation, more tricky, [41][42][43] is not approached in this work. In Section 2, the connection between entropy, heat and temperature was done through the Boltzmann distribution in which the population of an excited state k depends on the ratio between the energy difference and the temperature. Thus, when one raises the temperature, the lowest excited states are populated first. In the problem at hand, the probability of having the level k populated is more intricate since it is given by:\ndp k \u00bc kjH pert j0 E 0 \u00c0 E k 2 :(33)\nShould the numerator of the latter equation be the same for all the excited states, then a simple statistical distribution would be easily found. Indeed, the occupation would be a unique function of the inverse of excitation energies. Unfortunately, the numerator makes the connection between the ground state and the excited state through the perturbation potential. Therefore the numerator can be quite important for high excited states, and the population distribution may not be monotonic. Consequently, high excited states can be much more populated than lower ones. In this situation, a temperature can be hard to define rigorously. However, it will be shown in the next section that as an empirical relation exists between entropy and polarisation energy (heat), a temperature can be calculated. Indeed, one can use the macroscopic definition:\nT \u00bc @E @S :(34)",

At 30 K one expects from Boltzmann statistics about 0.1% in the lowest excited vibrational state. Even if the vibrational temperature of the anions were several Kelvin larger than the buffer gas temperature, which may occur due to trap imperfections and radiofrequency heating (see also the discussion in section 3.1) 2 , still no substantial population in any of the excited state is expected. Then at 85 K about 11% of the anions should be found with one of the two torsional modes excited. Higher-frequency vibrational modes and also overtones of the low frequencies only become populated at higher temperatures. At 200 K many states are populated, but due to the lack of knowledge on the eigenenergies of the overtone states we did not calculate populations for this temperature.\n\nFor the two torsional eigenstates, which are symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of two localised torsional modes, we assume that their Franck-Condon factors upon photodissociation to the neutral OH-H 2 O system, which subsequently dissociates into OH and H 2 O, are the same. One can then use the measured detachment cross sections for 30 K and 85 K, which increase by about a factor of 1.2 (see Fig. 5), to extract that the 11% torsionally excited anions should have about a threefold enhanced detachment cross section compared to vibrational ground state clusters.",

This is not surprising because the molecules are excited to upper levels by electron impact while they are de-excited back to the ground state by collisions with other molecules. In fact, with separate processes, one would be surprised if the excitation and de-excitation rates were equal and thermal equilibrium were achieved.\n\nIn contrast to the very selective population of upper levels by electron impact evident in low pressure spectra, spectra taken at higher pressures show a much more thermal distribution.

For the two-site Holstein model the energy separation (\u2206E) between two lowest eigen energy levels decreases monotonically with g + and becomes negligibly small at strong coupling 18 . At very low temperatures C v is very small for weak e-ph coupling, as \u2206E/k B T is sufficiently large. C v attains a maxima at an intermediate coupling, when \u2206E is \u223c 2.58k B T , and becomes very small in the strong coupling region as \u2206E \u2192 0. At a higher temperature a higher value of \u2206E is required to achieve the maximum value in C v . Since \u2206E increases with decreasing g + for the two-site Holstein model, the peak in C v is obtained at a lower value of g + for a higher temperature. With increasing temperature the higher energy states, in addition to the ground and first excited states, have significant contributions to the specific heat.

For example, the energy difference between the first and second isomers was reduced by 66%, from 1.75 to 0.58 kcal/mol; the energy difference between the second and third isomers increased almost 300%, from 0.1 to 0.27 kcal/mol, as shown in rows one and two of Table 1, respectively. This change (increase/decrease) in energy difference among isomers has an enormous impact on the relative population. Consequently, we deduced that the ZPE inclusion is essential to the isomers' energy ordering and molecular properties. The third row of Table 3 shows the energy order considering the Gibbs free energy computed at 298.15 K; at this temperature, the isomers' energy ordering changes: the second isomers are the putative global minima, and the first isomers have the fifth-lowest energy. Interestingly, this energy ordering occurs at 298.15 K, and it is a function of the temperature, which we discuss later in the relative population section. The fourth row in Table 3 shows the electronic energy considering the ZPE. It follows the same trend in energy ordering when considering the Gibbs free energy, and it is the same putative global minima. The fifth row in Table 3 details the electronic energy. It almost follows the CCSD(T) energies trend, except isomer number 8 takes second place, located at 0.52 kcal/mol above the putative global minima. The sixth, seventh, and eighth rows in Table 3 show the point-group symmetry, electronic ground state, and the lowest vibrational frequency of each isomer, respectively. When we use the Gibbs free energy to energy order the structures, the second isomers change to first place, becoming the lowest-energy structure; the energy ordering changes drastically, whereas the electronic energy follows a similar trend to that of CCSD(T) energy ordering. This shows us that the level of theory and the inclusion of entropy and temperature change the energy ordering and, therefore, the overall molecular properties. Figure 3a shows the most important and dominant T ss1-g point located at 377 K with a relative population of 33%.

While the intensity of the peak at positive frequencies is nearly independent of temperature, that of the low energy peak steadily decreases and vanishes at the lowest temperature shown of T = 100 K. This is in stark contrast to the behavior expected from an isolated two level system where the emission spectrum can be computed analytically as\nE(\u03c9) = 2 i=1 P i 1 + V \u01eb i \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u01eb i ) ,(32)\nwith the eigenstate energies, \u01eb 1,2 = \u00b1 \u221a V 2 + \u2206 2 , V is the electronic coupling, \u2206 is the bias, and the eigenstate population, P i = e \u2212\u03b2\u01eb i /Z. As seen from Eq. 32 the spectra are composed of two peaks centered at the eigenfrequencies of the system with intensities that are weighted by the respective Boltzmann populations of the two states. At low temperature the population localizes in the ground state, and the spectrum shifts to the red. In Fig. 2, the opposite occurs and a blue shift is clearly seen with decreasing temperature. This behavior is a result of the strong system bath coupling. To demonstrate this effect more clearly, Fig. 2b displays the reorganization energy dependence of the emission spectra at the lowest temperature shown in Fig. 2a of T = 100\n\nK. Only at very weak coupling, does the spectra resemble that expected for the isolated system from Eq. 32, with the emission dominated by the low energy eigenstate of the system. However, as the coupling increases in Fig. 2b, the weighting of the two peaks is redistributed towards the higher lying eigenstate resulting in a steady shift to the blue. As discussed in papers I and II, the equilibrium state of the total system and bath cannot be written in a factorized form as in Eq. 32, particularly when the temperature is low and the system-bath coupling large, as is the case here. This is the key feature that is responsible for the drastic failure of standard perturbative approximations to the emission spectra as well as the counterintuitive temperature dependence seen in Fig. 2a.\n\n\nB.

Rovibrational quantum calculations for angular momentum values J up to 15 were carried out, all bound states were assigned and then vibrational and rotational partition functions were computed. On the basis of the present results, [3] the relative populations of the linear and T-shaped conformers show a strong dependence on the temperature for both HeBr 2 and HeI 2 vdW complexes (see Figure 1). We found that the linear HeBr 2 isomer is energetically more stable than the T-shaped ones by 1.14 cm \u22121 at T=0 K, whereas conversion from linear to T-shaped complexes was observed at temperatures above 2.87 K. In turn, for the HeI 2 system the population inversion occurs at 1.04 K, with the energy difference between them being just 0.21 cm \u22121 . Interestingly, for the HeBr 2 a nice accord between experiment and theory has been achieved, while the HeI 2 case is still under consideration, pushing for further improvements in the both theoretical and experimental directions. \n\nFigure 1 .\n1Population ratio of linear and T-shaped isomers as a function of temperature.

Here, we consider a minimum to be significant when it is separated by a barrier larger than 1.5 kcal/mol and contains at least 2% of the total population. At both low temperature (275 K) and room temperature (300 K), we observed local minima corresponding to state N, I and U, as defined above ( Figure 4). Interestingly, we found that the U state from 275 K corresponds to a specific coil-like structure, while the U state at 300 K corresponds to a more heterogeneous population of coil structures. We speculate that the particular coil conformer observed at 275 K is only marginally stable at extremely low temperatures. When the temperature is raised slightly to 300 K, this particular coil conformer quickly overcomes energy barriers and inter-convert with other coil conformers or converts to more stable N and I state. As temperature is raised further to 347 K (Figure 4), N and I are no longer viewed as separate minima. At the same time, a newly emerged extended conformer E becomes more populated (where <0.7% of the structures belongs to E at 275 K, while 8% of the structures belongs to E at 347 K). At 400 K (Figure 4), state N is no longer significantly populated, signaling the final loss of native population. E is populated, but it ceases to be a separated minimum due to low barrier height at 400 K. The most populated structures at 400 K are coil-like unfolded structures (U), which are entropically favored due to their great structural heterogeneity. These structures seem to be flexible and rapidly inter-convert with each other due to the low barrier heights.",

The heat spike cools down to the ambient temperature in 1\u2013100 ps, so the \"temperature\" here does not correspond to thermodynamic equilibrium temperature. However, it has been shown that after about 3 lattice vibrations, the kinetic energy distribution of the atoms in a heat spike has the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution, making the use of the concept of temperature somewhat justified.

From the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, we see that the state has a six times greater probability of absorbing a photon moving to the left than a photon moving to the right. The opposite is true for the state. When the atom moves to the right it is more likely to absorb a photon moving to the left and likewise when the atom moves to the left it is more likely to absorb a photon moving to the right. Thus there is an unbalanced radiation pressure when the atom moves which dampens the motion of the atom, lowering its velocity and therefore its temperature.",

Avogadro's Law Revisited - \nSometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure.\n\nWe can extend Avogadro's law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to $\\mathrm{N}_{2}(g)+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{NH}_{3}(g)$, a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.\n\nThe explanation for this is illustrated in Figure 8.23. According to Avogadro's law, equal volumes of gaseous $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$, and $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ reacts with three molecules of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to produce two molecules of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, the volume of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ required is three times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$, and the volume of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ produced is two times the volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.23 One volume of $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ combines with three volumes of $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ to form two volumes of $\\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.",

LEARNING OBJECTIVES - \nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n- Describe the physical factors that lead to deviations from ideal gas behavior\n- Explain how these factors are represented in the van der Waals equation\n- Define compressibility (Z) and describe how its variation with pressure reflects non-ideal behavior\n- Quantify non-ideal behavior by comparing computations of gas properties using the ideal gas law and the van der Waals equation\n\nThus far, the ideal gas law, $P V=n R T$, has been applied to a variety of different types of problems, ranging from\nreaction stoichiometry and empirical and molecular formula problems to determining the density and molar mass of a gas. As mentioned in the previous modules of this chapter, however, the behavior of a gas is often non-ideal, meaning that the observed relationships between its pressure, volume, and temperature are not accurately described by the gas laws. In this section, the reasons for these deviations from ideal gas behavior are considered.\n\nOne way in which the accuracy of $P V=n R T$ can be judged is by comparing the actual volume of 1 mole of gas (its molar volume, $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ ) to the molar volume of an ideal gas at the same temperature and pressure. This ratio is called the compressibility factor ( $\\mathbf{Z}$ ) with:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Z}=\\frac{\\text { molar volume of gas at same } T \\text { and } P}{\\text { molar volume of ideal gas at same } T \\text { and } P}=\\left(\\frac{P V_{m}}{R T}\\right)_{\\text {measured }}\n$$\n\nIdeal gas behavior is therefore indicated when this ratio is equal to 1 , and any deviation from 1 is an indication of non-ideal behavior. Figure 8.35 shows plots of Z over a large pressure range for several common gases.\n\n\nFIGURE 8.35 A graph of the compressibility factor $(Z)$ vs. pressure shows that gases can exhibit significant deviations from the behavior predicted by the ideal gas law.\n\nAs is apparent from Figure 8.35, the ideal gas law does not describe gas behavior well at relatively high pressures. To determine why this is, consider the differences between real gas properties and what is expected of a hypothetical ideal gas.",

Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature.

The results of these computer experiments are that carbon clusters of size greater than 60 atoms are rapidly formed, anneal to giant fullerenes, and then these fullerenes shrink. The simulation could not be carried to long enough times for the shrinking to reach C60, but they propose reasonably that this shrinking process ultimately forms buckminsterfullerene. However, these simulations do not reveal the force driving the shrinking process. Here, this driving force for shrinking is found to be reactions in which C2 is swapped between fullerenes. The key element is that for typical fullerenes the equilibrium constants for such C2 interchanges are near unity, resulting in expansion of the breadth of the fullerene distribution in an annealing process. When fullerenes of 60 or 70 atoms are populated by shrinking, they fall into the local energy minimum of buckminsterfullerene or D5h C70. This simple mechanism accounts for the high yields (&gt;20%) of buckminsterfullerene that can be achieved in pure carbon systems.",

The nature of the symmetry breaking in C(60) relative to the radicaloid fullerene, C(36), is assessed by energy lowering of the UHF solution, &lt;S(2)&gt;, and the unpaired electron number. We conclude that the high value of each of these measures in C(60) is not attributable to strong correlation behavior as is the case for C(36). Instead, their origin is from the collective effect of relatively weak, global correlations present in the \u03c0 space of both fullerenes.

Carbon clusters studied include fullerenes and fullerene-derived structures (e.g., cages and onions), icosahedral structures, bucky-diamond structures, and clusters cut from the bulk diamond with spherical and facetted truncations. The reason for using a semiempirical MD is partly due to the large number of different cases (or carbon allotropes) investigated and partly due to the size of the clusters investigated in this work.

A general mechanism has been proposed in which the graphitic sheets bend in an attempt to eliminate the highly energetic dangling bonds present at the edge of the growing structure.  Here, I report the response of carbon soot particles and tubular graphitic structures to intense electron-beam irradiation in a high-resolution electron microscope; such conditions resemble a high-temperature regime, permitting a degree of structural fluidity.  With increased irradiation, there is a gradual reorganization of the initial material into quasi-spherical particles composed of concentric graphitic shells.

The model (i) focuses on each Rydberg orbital's large peak of high amplitude, (ii) approximates the electron density within this peak as constant within a radial shell characterized by a radius &lt;r&gt; and thickness T both of which depend on the quantum number n, and (iii) assumes that strong coupling (either with an orbital of an anion donor or to a disulfide sigma* or a backbone amide pi* orbital) occurs when the valence orbital penetrates fully within the radial shell of the Rydberg orbital. These assumptions permit a derivation of the ratios of rates of electron transfer for n &gt; 3 to those for n = 3. Combining these ratios with ab initio rates for n = 3 allows one to make rate predictions for inter- and intramolecular electron transfer involving Rydberg orbitals appropriate to the electron transfer dissociation process. One important prediction of this model is that the combination of large-penetration and Landau-Zener surface-crossing conditions places very severe limitations on which Rydberg levels can initially be populated in electron transfer dissociation. Another prediction is that a Rydberg orbital of a given principal quantum number n has a limited range of distances over which it can transfer an electron; sigma* or pi* orbitals either too far from or too close to a given Rydberg orbital cannot accept an electron from that orbital.",

The molecular orientation in a monolayer affects the orientation in a multilayer, formed on the monolayer, suggesting the possibility of the latter to act as a template for controlling the structure of the three dimensionally grown self-assembled molecular aggregation. A systematic study on the electronic structure and orientation associated with C60 functionalized aminothiol self-assembled monolayers on Au(111) surface is presented using surface sensitive Ultra-Violet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) and C-K edge Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. The results revealed drastic modifications to d-band structure of Au(111) and the electronic structure was found sensitive towards the S-Au interface and the C60 end functional moiety with formation of localized sigma-(S-Au) and sigma(N-C) bonds, respectively. Upon binding C60 to the amine-terminated alkanethiol SAM, a drastically reduced HOMO-LUMO gap of 2.7 eV as compared to a large electronic gap of approximately 8 eV in alkanethiols enables the SAM to be a potential electron transport medium.",

Simulations reveal that the preferred position of a single C60 fullerene is about 6-7 A off of the center plane, allowing the fullerene to take advantage of strong dispersion interactions with denser regions of the bilayer. Further displacement (&gt;8 A) of the fullerene away from the center plane results in a rapid increase in free energy likely due to distortion of the lipid head group layer. The effective interaction between fullerenes (direct interaction plus environment (bilayer)-induced interaction), measured as the potential of mean force (POMF) between two fullerenes as a function of their separation, was found to be significantly less attractive in the lipid bilayer than in an alkane melt of the same molecular weight as the lipid tails. Only part of this difference can be accounted for by the more favorable interaction of the fullerene with the relatively denser bilayer. Additionally, our POMF studies indicate that the bilayer is less able to accommodate the larger aggregated fullerene pair than isolated single fullerenes, again likely due to distortion of the bilayer structure. The implications of these effects on aggregation of fullerenes within lipid bilayer are considered.",

Evaluation of the properties in an infinite crystal.\nThe previously reported exact potential and multipole moment (EP/MM) method for fast and precise evaluation of the intermolecular electrostatic interaction energies in molecular crystals using the pseudoatom representation of the electron density [Nguyen, Macchi &amp; Volkov (2020), Acta Cryst. A76, 630-651] has been extended to the calculation of the electrostatic potential (ESP), electric field (EF) and electric field gradient (EFG) in an infinite crystal. The presented approach combines an efficient Ewald-type summation (ES) of atomic multipoles up to the hexadecapolar level in direct and reciprocal spaces with corrections for (i) the net polarization of the sample (the `surface term') due to a net dipole moment of the crystallographic unit cell (if present) and (ii) the short-range electron-density penetration effects. The rederived and reported closed-form expressions for all terms in the ES algorithm have been augmented by the expressions for the surface term available in the literature [Stenhammar, Trulsson &amp; Linse (2011), J. Chem. Phys. 134, 224104] and the exact potential expressions reported in a previous study [Volkov, King, Coppens &amp; Farrugia (2006), Acta Cryst. A62, 400-408]. The resulting algorithm, coded using Fortran in the XDPROP module of the software package XD, was tested on several small molecular crystal systems (formamide, benzene, L-dopa, paracetamol, amino acids etc.) and compared with a series of EP/MM-based direct-space summations (DS) performed within a certain number of unit cells generated along both the positive and negative crystallographic directions. The EP/MM-based ES technique allows for a noticeably more precise determination of the EF and EFG and significantly better precision of the evaluated ESP when compared with the DS calculations, even when the latter include contributions from an array of symmetry-equivalent atoms generated within four additional unit cells along each crystallographic direction. In terms of computational performance, the ES/EP/MM method is significantly faster than the DS calculations performed within the extended unit-cell limits but trails the DS calculations within the reduced summation ranges. Nonetheless, the described EP/MM-based ES algorithm is superior to the direct-space summations as it does not require the user to monitor continuously the convergence of the evaluated properties as a function of the summation limits and offers a better precision-performance balance.",

The geometries of the excited states are obtained from time-dependent density functional (TDDFT) calculations employing the B3LYP hybrid functional. The vibrational functions and transition dipole moment derivatives are calculated within the harmonic approximation by finite difference of analytical gradients and the transition dipole moment, respectively. Normal mode mixing is taken into account by the Duschinsky transformation. The vibronic structure of strongly dipole-allowed transitions is calculated within the Franck-Condon approximation. Weakly dipole-allowed and dipole-forbidden transitions are treated within the Franck-Condon-Herzberg-Teller and Herzberg-Teller approximation, respectively. The absorption spectra of several organic pi systems (anthracene, pentacene, pyrene, octatetraene, styrene, azulene, phenoxyl) are calculated and compared with experimental data. For dipole-allowed transitions in general a very good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained. This indicates the good quality of the optimized geometries and harmonic force fields. Larger errors are found for the weakly dipole-allowed S0 --&gt; S1 transition of pyrene which can tentatively be assigned to TDDFT errors for the relative energies of excited states close to the target state. The weak bands of azulene and phenoxyl are very well described within the Franck-Condon approximation which can be explained by the large energy gap (&gt;1.2 eV) to higher-lying excited states leading to small vibronic couplings. Once corrections are made for the errors in the theoretical 0-0 transition energies, the TDDFT approach to calculate vibronic structure seems to outperform both widely used ab initio methods based on configuration interaction singles or complete active space self-consistent field wave functions and semiempirical treatments regarding accuracy, applicability, and computational effort. Together with the parallel computer implementations employed, the present approach appears to be a valuable tool for a quantitative description and detailed understanding of electronic excitation processes in large molecules.",

The bending vibrational frequencies of the A (3)Pi state were evaluated via the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) techniques.

For the ground state of 1 and of its radical cation (1(+*)) and anion (1(-*)), we report the UV-visible absorption spectra, and for neutral 1, also the magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and the decomposition of the absorption spectrum into purely polarized components, deduced from fluorescence polarization. These results were used to identify a series of singlet excited states. For the first excited singlet and triplet states of 1, the transient visible absorption spectra, S(1) --&gt; S(x) and sensitized T(1) --&gt; T(x), and single exponential lifetimes, tau(F) = approximately 5.3 ns and tau(T) = approximately 200 micros, are reported. The spectra and lifetimes of S(1) --&gt; S(0) fluorescence and sensitized T(1) --&gt; T(x) absorption of 1 were obtained in a series of solvents, as was the fluorescence quantum yield, Phi(F) = 0.95-0.99. No phosphorescence has been detected. The first triplet excitation energy of solid 1 (11,400 cm(-1)) was obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy, in agreement with previously reported solution values. The fluorescence excitation spectrum suggests an onset of a nonradiative channel at approximately 37,000 cm(-1). Excitation energies and relative transition intensities are in agreement with those of ab initio (CC2) calculations after an empirical 3000 cm(-1) adjustment of the initial state energy to correct differentially for a better quality description of the initial relative to the terminal state of an absorption transition. The interpretation of the MCD spectrum used the semiempirical PPP method, whose results for the S(0) --&gt; S(x) spectrum require no empirical adjustment and are otherwise nearly identical with the CC2 results in all respects including the detailed nature of the electronic excitation. The ground state geometry of 1 was also calculated by the MP2, B3LYP, and CAS methods. The calculations provided a prediction of changes of molecular geometry upon excitation or ionization and permitted an interpretation of the spectra in terms of molecular orbitals involved. Computations suggest that 1 can exist as two nearly isoenergetic conformers of C(2) or C(s) symmetry. Linear dichroism measurements in stretched polyethylene provide evidence for their existence and show that they orient to different degrees, permitting a separation of their spectra in the region of the purely polarized first absorption band. Their excitation energies are nearly identical, but the Franck-Condon envelopes of their first transition differ to a surprising degree.",

Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of &gt;2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.(13) Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.",

The calculations were performed at the second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) and the coupled cluster including singles, doubles, and a perturbative estimate of triples replacement [CCSD(T)] levels of electronic structure theory. At both levels of theory, by including results corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), we have estimated the complete basis set (CBS) limit by employing the family of Dunning's correlation-consistent polarized valence basis sets. The largest MP2 calculation was performed with the cc-pV6Z basis set (2772 basis functions), whereas the largest CCSD(T) calculation was with the cc-pV5Z basis set (1752 basis functions). The cluster geometries were optimized with basis sets up to quadruple-\u03b6 quality, observing that both its intra- and intermolecular parts have practically converged with the triple-\u03b6 quality sets. The use of converged geometries was found to play an important role for obtaining accurate estimates for the CBS limits. Our results demonstrate that the binding energies with the families of the plain (cc-pVnZ) and augmented (aug-cc-pVnZ) sets converge [within &lt;0.01 kcal/mol for MP2 and &lt;0.15 kcal/mol for CCSD(T)] to the same CBS limit. In addition, the average of the uncorrected and BSSE-corrected binding energies was found to converge to the same CBS limit much faster than either of the two constituents (uncorrected or BSSE-corrected binding energies). Due to the fact that the family of augmented basis sets (especially for the larger sets) causes serious linear dependency problems, the plain basis sets (for which no linear dependencies were found) are deemed as a more efficient and straightforward path for obtaining an accurate CBS limit. We considered extrapolations of the uncorrected (\u0394E) and BSSE-corrected (\u0394Ecp) binding energies, their average value (\u0394Eave), as well as the average of the latter over the plain and augmented sets (\u0394\u1ebcave) with the cardinal number of the basis set n. Our best estimate of the CCSD(T)/CBS limit for the \u03c0-\u03c0 binding energy in the PD benzene dimer is De = -2.65 \u00b1 0.02 kcal/mol. The best CCSD(T)/cc-pV5Z calculated value is -2.62 kcal/mol, just 0.03 kcal/mol away from the CBS limit. For comparison, the MP2/CBS limit estimate is -5.00 \u00b1 0.01 kcal/mol, demonstrating a 90% overbinding with respect to CCSD(T). The spin-component-scaled (SCS) MP2 variant was found to closely reproduce the CCSD(T) results for each basis set, while scaled opposite spin (SOS) MP2 yielded results that are too low when compared to CCSD(T).

In the literature there are few works devoted to the problem of calculations of molecular excitations of the fullerene [7,8,9,10], but to the best of our knowledge all of them are semiempirical and are based only on singly excited configuration interaction (CI). We reproduce some of their computed levels in Table I. The calculation of Negri et al., Ref. [8], employed a semiempirical (QCFF/\u03c0) method, and took into account 196 configuration state functions (CSF). The first excited state (1 3 T 2g ) was found at 2.06 eV, while 1 1 T 1u and 2 1 T 1u levels at 4.08 and 4.53 eV. A PPP-CI (Pariser-Parr-Pople Configuration Interaction) calculation which includes 134 CSF finds first two 1 T 1u levels at 4.00 eV, 4.68 eV and 6.69 eV, with the first excited 3 T 2g level at 2.23 eV. Finally, CNDO/S calculations of Braga et al. based on 808 and 900 configurations predicts that 1 1 T 1u is lowered to 3.4 eV, while the three most intense transitions are at 4.38, 5.24 and 5.78 eV. Unfortunately, all of the CI calculations reported in Refs. [7,8,9,10] are crucially dependent on a number of approximations for matrix elements and therefore cannot be considered as a true ab initio approach.\n\nIn the present study in comparison with Refs.

Resonant pre-excitation of the electronic system via the first dipole-allowed HOMO--&gt;LUMO+1(t(1g)) (HOMO denotes highest occupied molecular orbital and LUMO denotes lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) transition with ultrashort 25 fs pulses at 399 nm of some 10(12) W cm(-2) results in a highly nonequilibrium distribution of excited electrons and vibrational modes in the neutral species. The subsequent coupling among the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is monitored by probing the system with time-delayed 27 fs pulses at 797 nm of some 10(13) W cm(-2). Direct information on the characteristic relaxation time is derived from the analysis of transient singly and multiply charged parent and fragment ion signals as a function of pump-probe delay and laser pulse intensity. The observed relaxation times tau(el) approximately 60-400 fs are attributed to different microcanonical ensembles prepared in the pre-excitation process and correspond to different total energy contents and energy sharing between electronic and vibrational degrees. The characteristic differences and trends allow one to extract a consistent picture for the formation dynamics of ions in different charge states and their fullerenelike fragments and give evidence to collective effects in multiple ionization such as plasmon-enhanced energy deposition.",

The first ultraviolet absorption band is then studied by means of quantum mechanical wave packet propagation. Excitation of the repulsive 2 (1)A' state gives the main contribution to the cross section. Excitation of the repulsive 1 (1)A\" state is about a factor of 20 weaker at the absorption peak (E(ph) \u2248 45,000 cm(-1)) but becomes comparable to the 2 (1)A' state absorption with decreasing energy (35,000 cm(-1)) and eventually exceeds it. Direct excitation of the repulsive triplet states is negligible except at photon energies E(ph) &lt; 38,000 cm(-1). The main structure observed in the cross section is caused by excitation of the bound 2 (3)A\" state, which is nearly degenerate with the 2 (1)A' state in the Franck-Condon region. The structure observed in the low energy tail of the spectrum is caused by excitation of quasi-bound bending vibrational states of the 2 (1)A' and 1 (1)A\" electronic states. The absorption cross sections agree well with experimental data and the temperature dependence of the cross section is well reproduced.",

In accord with the short-time picture of spectroscopy, the excited-state potential energy surface is expanded at the ground-state equilibrium geometry and the focus of the approach is more on the overall shape of the spectrum and the positions of the band maxima, rather than the precise position of the 0-0 lines. The Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the separability of the excited-state potential energy surface along the excited-state normal mode coordinates are assumed. However, the potential surface is not necessarily approximated as harmonic oscillator potentials along the individual normal modes. Instead, depending upon the nature of the potential surface along a particular normal mode, it is treated either in the harmonic approximation or the full one-dimensional potential is considered along this mode. The vertical Franck-Condon approach is applicable therefore even in cases where the excited state potential energy surface is highly anharmonic and the conventional harmonic Franck-Condon approach is inadequate. As an application of the method, the ultraviolet spectrum of ethylene between 6.2 eV (50,000 cm(-1)) and 8.7 eV (70,000 cm(-1)) is simulated, using the Similarity Transformed Equation of Motion Coupled-Cluster method to describe the required features of the potential energy surfaces. The spectrum is shown to be a result of sharp doublet structures stemming from the pi --&gt; 3s (Rydberg) state superimposed on top of a broad band resulting from the pi --&gt; pi* (valence) state. For the Rydberg state, the symmetric C=C stretch and the torsion mode contribute to the spectrum, while the broad valence band results from excitation into the C=C stretch, CH2 scissors, and the torsion mode. For both states, the potential along the torsion mode is highly anharmonic and the full treatment of the potential along this mode in the vertical Franck-Condon method is required.",

To generate the input signals for the Fourier transform of the resonances on a flat, nondecaying background, we considered ratios of the results of two consecutive angular levels of \u03c0 electrons for both the fullerene molecules. Fourier magnitudes of these ratios are calculated by using the fast Fourier transform algorithm after applying an appropriate window function to reduce spurious structures. While such windowing adds some extra width to the \"frequency\" peaks, it practically does not compromise the peak positions. The results are presented in Fig. 5 in reciprocal (radial) coordinates. All the curves in Fig. 5(b) exhibit strong peaks located around the diameter d c for each of C 60 and C 240 , as expected from our model equation, Eq. (28), that includes the function cos(Qd c \u2212 \u2113 t \u03c0 + \u03b7 r \u03c0); the transform magnitudes are insensitive to phase-shifts connected to \u2113 t and \u03b7 r . To guide the eye, LDA radial potentials and positron scattering potentials for homo captures are plotted in Fig. 5(a). Notice, the small, systematic offset of the peaks towards lower values with the increasing angular momentum. This is even another signature of the fact that the continuum waves are Coulomb distorted and so are more complicated than simple plane waves used in our model analysis. In fact, we could generally anticipate this variation by noting in Fig. 4 Fig. 5(b)]. For C 60 , the ratios considered in Fig. 4 \n\n\nIV. CONCLUSION",

We show that a geometric constraint-exclusion of head-to-tail dihedral angle discrepancies (DADs)-explains this limited selection as well as successful assembly into such closed cages in the first place. An edge running from a pentagon to a hexagon has a DAD, since the dihedral angles about the edge broaden from its pentagon (tail) end to its hexagon (head) end. Of the 21 configurations of a central face and surrounding faces, six have such DAD vectors arranged head-to-tail. Of the 5770 mathematically possible fullerene cages for n &lt;or= 60, excluding those with any of the six configurations leaves just 15 cages plus buckminsterfullerene (n = 60), among them the known clathrin cages.

Abundances of fullerenes (% of gas-phase carbon locked in species), derived from emission or absorption measurements in star-forming regions and in the diffuse ISM and evolved stars.  Bakes & Tielens (1995) computed the charge distribution for the specific case of C 60 in the diffuse ISM and find that \u223c 30% is anionic, \u223c 60% is neutral, and \u223c 10% is cationic. These numbers are compatible with the absolute abundances summarized in Table 2, which point to a (not very restrictive) C 60 over C + 60 ratio ranging between 0.3 to 6. C \u2212 60 is expected to be abundant in models and hence could be searched for in space. The strongest vibrational bands of C \u2212 60 are around 17.5 and 7.3 \u00b5m (Kupser et al. 2008). The 17.5 \u00b5m band is difficult to identify because of the presence of PAH emission at 17.4 \u00b5m. A band at 7.3 \u00b5m seems present in the spectrum of the Chamaeleon line of sight, however this region of the spectrum is quite noisy and higher sensitivity data will be required to confirm this. Observations of diffuse lines of sight with the James Webb Space Telescope, which has the sensitivity to detect C 60 and C + 60 as well as tracers of the diffuse ISM should allow us to conduct more detailed studies on the charge balance of C 60 in the diffuse ISM. Laboratory studies to quantify key molecular parameters involved, such as the electron recombination rate of C + 60 , are also required. Finally, the detection of C 60 IR emission bands in the diffuse ISM suggests that the electronic transitions of this molecules could be identified in absorption. However, given their low oscillator strengths, this will be challenging as we illustrate in Appendix E.\n\n\nConclusion",
