Computational Chemistry in Drug Design - \nWhile the descriptions of bonding described in this chapter involve many theoretical concepts, they also have many practical, real-world applications. For example, drug design is an important field that uses our understanding of chemical bonding to develop pharmaceuticals. This interdisciplinary area of study uses biology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site that is involved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs, computational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see Figure 5.33). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising candidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they can be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been discovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.33 The molecule shown, HIV-1 protease, is an important target for pharmaceutical research. By designing molecules that bind to this protein, scientists are able to drastically inhibit the progress of the disease.",

Computational Chemistry in Drug Design - \nWhile the descriptions of bonding described in this chapter involve many theoretical concepts, they also have many practical, real-world applications. For example, drug design is an important field that uses our understanding of chemical bonding to develop pharmaceuticals. This interdisciplinary area of study uses biology (understanding diseases and how they operate) to identify specific targets, such as a binding site that is involved in a disease pathway. By modeling the structures of the binding site and potential drugs, computational chemists can predict which structures can fit together and how effectively they will bind (see Figure 5.33). Thousands of potential candidates can be narrowed down to a few of the most promising candidates. These candidate molecules are then carefully tested to determine side effects, how effectively they can be transported through the body, and other factors. Dozens of important new pharmaceuticals have been discovered with the aid of computational chemistry, and new research projects are underway.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.33 The molecule shown, HIV-1 protease, is an important target for pharmaceutical research. By designing molecules that bind to this protein, scientists are able to drastically inhibit the progress of the disease.",

The dietary forms of carbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name \"carbohydrate\" comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{m}}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{\\mathrm{n}}$, which shows that they are in a sense \"carbon and water\" or \"hydrates of carbon.\" In many cases, $m$ and $n$ have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally referred to as \"sugars,\" the biochemical term for this group of molecules is \"saccharide\" from the Greek word for sugar (Figure 21.12). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified as monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or polysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars-polymers were described in the feature box earlier in this chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix -ose at the end of the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called \"fructose\" and milk sugar is a disaccharide called lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together). Sugars contain some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the structures and how monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether.\n\n\nfructos\n\n\nFIGURE 21.12 The illustrations show the molecular structures of fructose, a five-carbon monosaccharide, and of lactose, a disaccharide composed of two isomeric, six-carbon sugars.",

This occurs because all fatty acids are derived biosynthetically from acetyl CoA by sequential addition of two-carbon units to a growing chain. The acetyl CoA, in turn, arises primarily from the metabolic breakdown of carbohydrates in the glycolysis pathway, which we'll see in Section 29.5. Thus, dietary carbohydrates consumed in excess of immediate energy needs are turned into fats for storage.\n\nAs a general rule in biological chemistry, the anabolic pathway by which a substance is made is not the reverse of the catabolic pathway by which the same substance is degraded. The two paths must differ in some respects for both to be energetically favorable. Thus, the $\\beta$-oxidation pathway for converting fatty acids into acetyl CoA and the biosynthesis of fatty acids from acetyl CoA are related but are not exact opposites. Differences include the identity of the acyl-group carrier, the stereochemistry of the $\\beta$-hydroxyacyl reaction intermediate, and the identity of the redox coenzyme. FAD is used to introduce a double bond in $\\beta$-oxidation, while NADPH is used to reduce the double bond in fatty-acid biosynthesis.\n\nIn bacteria, each step in fatty-acid synthesis is catalyzed by a separate enzyme. In vertebrates, however, fattyacid synthesis is catalyzed by an immense, multienzyme complex called a synthase that contains two identical subunits of 2505 amino acids each and catalyzes all steps in the pathway. In fact, for an 18-carbon fatty acid, the synthase catalyzes 42 separate steps! An overview of fatty-acid biosynthesis is shown in FIGURE 29.6.",

Organisms rely on proteins for a variety of functions-proteins transport molecules across cell membranes, replicate DNA, and catalyze metabolic reactions, to name only a few of their functions. The properties of proteins are functions of the combination of amino acids that compose them and can vary greatly. Interactions between amino acid sequences in the chains of proteins result in the folding of the chain into specific, threedimensional structures that determine the protein's activity.\n\nAmino acids are organic molecules that contain an amine functional group ( $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ), a carboxylic acid functional group ( -COOH ), and a side chain (that is specific to each individual amino acid). Most living things build proteins from the same 20 different amino acids. Amino acids connect by the formation of a peptide bond, which is a covalent bond formed between two amino acids when the carboxylic acid group of one amino acid reacts with the amine group of the other amino acid. The formation of the bond results in the production of a molecule of water (in general, reactions that result in the production of water when two other molecules combine are referred to as condensation reactions). The resulting bond-between the carbonyl group carbon atom and the amine nitrogen atom is called a peptide link or peptide bond. Since each of the original amino acids has an unreacted group (one has an unreacted amine and the other an unreacted carboxylic acid), more peptide bonds can form to other amino acids, extending the structure. (Figure 21.20) A chain of connected amino acids is called a polypeptide. Proteins contain at least one long polypeptide chain.\n\n\nFIGURE 21.20 This condensation reaction forms a dipeptide from two amino acids and leads to the formation of water.",

Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms (Figure 1.14). One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf balls.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.14 The elements hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur form molecules consisting of two or more atoms of the same element.

Fibrous proteins, such as the collagen in tendons and connective tissue and the myosin in muscle tissue, consist of polypeptide chains arranged side by side in long filaments. Because these proteins are tough and insoluble in water, they are used in nature for structural materials. Globular proteins, by contrast, are usually coiled into compact, roughly spherical shapes. These proteins are generally soluble in water and are mobile within cells. Most of the more than 3000 or so enzymes that have been characterized are globular proteins, including the 1300 different enzymes in the human body.\n\nProteins are so large that the word structure takes on a broader meaning than with simpler organic compounds. In fact, chemists speak of four different levels of structure when describing proteins.\n\n- The primary structure of a protein is simply the amino acid sequence.\n- The secondary structure of a protein describes how segments of the peptide backbone orient into a regular pattern.\n- The tertiary structure describes how the entire protein molecule coils into an overall three-dimensional shape.\n- The quaternary structure describes how different protein molecules come together to yield large aggregate structures.\n\nPrimary structure is determined, as we've seen, by sequencing the protein. Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures are determined either by NMR or by X-ray crystallography (Chapter 12 Chemistry Matters).",

Only a few elements, such as the gases helium, neon, and argon, consist of a collection of individual atoms that move about independently of one another. Other elements, such as the gases hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine, are composed of units that consist of pairs of atoms (Figure 1.14). One form of the element phosphorus consists of units composed of four phosphorus atoms. The element sulfur exists in various forms, one of which consists of units composed of eight sulfur atoms. These units are called molecules. A molecule consists of two or more atoms joined by strong forces called chemical bonds. The atoms in a molecule move around as a unit, much like the cans of soda in a six-pack or a bunch of keys joined together on a single key ring. A molecule may consist of two or more identical atoms, as in the molecules found in the elements hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, or it may consist of two or more different atoms, as in the molecules found in water. Each water molecule is a unit that contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Each glucose molecule is a unit that contains 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. Like atoms, molecules are incredibly small and light. If an ordinary glass of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the water molecules inside it would be about the size of golf balls.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.14 The elements hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur form molecules consisting of two or more atoms of the same element.

The dietary forms of carbohydrates are foods rich in these types of molecules, like pastas, bread, and candy. The name \"carbohydrate\" comes from the formula of the molecules, which can be described by the general formula $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{m}}\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)_{\\mathrm{n}}$, which shows that they are in a sense \"carbon and water\" or \"hydrates of carbon.\" In many cases, $m$ and $n$ have the same value, but they can be different. The smaller carbohydrates are generally referred to as \"sugars,\" the biochemical term for this group of molecules is \"saccharide\" from the Greek word for sugar (Figure 21.12). Depending on the number of sugar units joined together, they may be classified as monosaccharides (one sugar unit), disaccharides (two sugar units), oligosaccharides (a few sugars), or polysaccharides (the polymeric version of sugars-polymers were described in the feature box earlier in this chapter on recycling plastics). The scientific names of sugars can be recognized by the suffix -ose at the end of the name (for instance, fruit sugar is a monosaccharide called \"fructose\" and milk sugar is a disaccharide called lactose composed of two monosaccharides, glucose and galactose, connected together). Sugars contain some of the functional groups we have discussed: Note the alcohol groups present in the structures and how monosaccharide units are linked to form a disaccharide by formation of an ether.\n\n\nfructos\n\n\nFIGURE 21.12 The illustrations show the molecular structures of fructose, a five-carbon monosaccharide, and of lactose, a disaccharide composed of two isomeric, six-carbon sugars.",
