Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction.

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

The reaction proceeds with C-N bond cleavage in the carbinolamine intermediate, shows excellent functional group tolerance, and delivers the alcohol products in very high yields. The expected C-O cleavage products are not formed under the reaction conditions. The observed reactivity is opposite to the electrophilicity of polar carbonyl groups resulting from the n(X) → π*(C═O) (X = O, N) conjugation. Mechanistic studies suggest that coordination of Sm to the carbonyl and then to Lewis basic nitrogen in the tetrahedral intermediate facilitate electron transfer and control the selectivity of the C-N/C-O cleavage. Notably, the method provides direct access to acyl-type radicals from unactivated amides under mild electron transfer conditions.",

For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed. The gas-phase proton affinity of L shows instructive correlations with structural parameters and energy gaps for the investigated reactions.",

The condition of exactness for n=2 defines nCCSD=2CC, with nCCSDT=3CC and nCCSDTQ=4CC being exact for three and four electrons. To achieve this, the minimum number of diagrams is evaluated, which is less than in the corresponding CC model. For all practical purposes, nCC is also the proper definition of a size-extensive CI. 2CC is also an orbitally invariant coupled electron pair approximation. The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result. As 2CC is exact for separated electron pairs, it is the natural zeroth-order approximation for the correlation problem in molecules with other effects introduced as these units start to interact. The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding. Excited states from the equation of motion (EOM-2CC) are also reported, which show results frequently approaching those of EOM-CCSDT.",

Subjects consisted of 15 adult Japanese males with normal stomatognathic function, no missing teeth except for the third molars, and equivalent occlusal contact in the anterior and bilateral posterior regions. Silicon biteplates fabricated for each subject to evaluate gravity fluctuation in relation to changes in occlusal contact area were as follows: RP(-)-OC(+) (entire occlusal surface covered in centric occlusion); RP(+)-OC(+) (entire occlusal surface covered with bite slightly raised); Ant or Pos/RP(+)-OC(+) (anterior or posterior region selectively covered); and RP(+)-OC(-) (only retromolar pads covered, no occlusal coverage). No significant differences in gravity fluctuation were noted between subjects wearing biteplates covering the entire occlusal surface. Subjects wearing biteplates with no occlusal contact showed greater gravity fluctuation than those with occlusal contact. In addition, gravity fluctuation for the Ant/RP(+)-OC(+) group (no occlusal contact in the posterior region) was greater than for RP(+)-OC(+) and Pos/RP(+)-OC(+). However, groups with unilateral occlusal contact in the posterior region exhibited large right and left sway amplitude.

However, the involvement of CAFs in oral cancer (OC) has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

A joint experimental and theoretical study.\nThe vibrational properties of two difluoroaminocarbonyl species were analyzed by recording the FTIR spectra of the vapor for difluoroaminocarbonyl fluoride, F(2)NC(O)F, and difluoroaminocarbonyl isocyanate, F(2)NC(O)NCO. Moreover, the Raman spectrum of liquid F(2)NC(O)NCO was obtained. Vibrational assignments were made on the basis of a normal coordinate analysis and the evaluation of the band contours appearing in the FTIR spectrum of the vapor. The conformational space of both difluoroaminocarbonyl derivatives were studied by using the B3LYP and MP2 level of theory with extended basis sets [6-311+G(3df) and aug-cc-pVTZ]. Only one conformation belonging to the C(1) symmetry point group is expected for F(2)NC(O)F, whereas the overall evaluation of experimental and theoretical results suggests the existence of a mixture of two conformers for F(2)NC(O)NCO at room temperature. Its relative abundance of the most stable syn form (C=O double bond syn with respect to the N=C=O group) was estimated to be 56(5) %.",

In addition to the known species ClCO*, OCCl2, syn-ClC(O)SCl, syn-ClC(O)SSCl, IC(O)Cl, IC(O)Br, and syn-BrC(O)SBr, syn-iodocarbonylsulfenyl bromide, syn-IC(O)SBr, has thus been identified for the first time as a photoproduct of the reactions involving IBr. The first product to be formed in the reactions with Cl2 or ICl is the ClCO* radical which reacts subsequently with halogen or sulfur atoms or other matrix guests to give the corresponding carbonyl dihalide (OCCl2 and IC(O)Cl), syn-ClC(O)SCl or syn-ClC(O)SSCl.

Although recent computational investigations have proposed that the OC-COH coupling pathway is more favorable in specific reaction conditions than the well-known CO dimerization pathway, the experimental evidence is still lacking, partly due to the separated catalyst design and mechanistic/spectroscopic exploration. Here, we employ density functional theory calculations to show that on low-coordinated copper sites, the *CO bindings are strengthened, and the adsorbed *CO coupling with their hydrogenation species, *COH, receives precedence over CO dimerization. Experimentally, we construct a fragmented Cu catalyst with abundant low-coordinated sites, exhibiting a 77.8% Faradaic efficiency for C<sub2+</sub products at 300 mA cm<sup-2</sup.

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)).

RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

The quadratic force constants and the stretching potentials of Hn CCHn have been calculated at the CASSCF/cc-pVTZ level. The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The calculations predict that the kinetically most favorable reaction proceeds with an activation barrier of 8.1 kcal mol(-1) via [3+2] addition across the O=Os=CH2 moiety. This reaction is -42.4 kcal mol(-1) exothermic. Alternatively, the [3+2] addition to the H2C=Os=CH2 fragment of 1 leads to the most stable addition product 4 (-72.7 kcal mol(-1)), yet this process has a higher activation barrier (13.0 kcal mol(-1)).

Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H). Much less competitively, 1 (1a,1b) can undergo 3,4 H shift to form CH(2)CHCHCH 5. Subsequently, 5 can undergo either C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         ) (CH(2)CHCCH+H) or C-C bond cleavage to generate P                         (                            7                         ) (C(2)H(2)+C(2)H(3)).

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

If sodium chlorite powder (NaClO2(s)) can oxidize NO to NO2, the injection of NaClO2(s) can be simply adapted to NO oxidation. Therefore, we explored the reaction pathways of NO oxidation by NaClO2(s). Known concentrations of NO and NO2 in N2 balance were injected into packed-bed reactor containing NaClO2(s) at 130 degreesC. NaClO2(s) oxidized NO to NO2 which reacts again with NaClO2(s) to produce OClO. Comparison of experimental data with simulation results demonstrates that each NO2 molecule removed by the reaction with NaClO2(s) generated one OClO molecule, which also oxidized NO to NO2 with the production of ClNO and ClNO2. Using these results, we conclude that the oxidation of NO by NaClO2(s) occurred by two pathways. One is through the direct reaction of NO with NaClO(s).

(1976) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 449, 157-168). The high values were attributed to the presence of impurities of copper, which compete for O-2. This assumption is consistent with either a decrease in the reduction yield of ferricytochrome C in the presence of copper, or with a very fast reaction of Cu(I) with ferricytochrome C. It was previously shown by us and by others that the reduction yield of ferricytochrome C by O-2 IS 100%. We measured the rate of reduction of ferricytochrome C by Cu(I), and found that this reaction is slow: k = (1.5 +/- 0.5) . 10(3) M-1 . s-1.

Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H). Much less competitively, 1 (1a,1b) can undergo 3,4 H shift to form CH(2)CHCHCH 5.

The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result.

The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)).

Ab initio calculations indicate that CH2=CCHO has a linear C-C-C backbone with Cs symmetry, where the formyl group is in the Cs plane and perpendicular to the methylene group. The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom. The ground state CH2=CCHO can, thus, be described as taking the formylvinyl (CH2=Ċ-CH=O) form rather than as the allenyloxy (CH2=C=CH-Ȯ) form. ",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

This allows direct measurement of the Csp(2)-Csp(2) reductive elimination rate constant within a catalytic cycle. The rate constants of p-MePhZnCl are obtained in the range 0.23 to 3.5 s(-1) from 0 to -35 degrees C, which are unusually fast reaction rates.

Using spectroscopic networks and tools of graph theory, CSC helps to find the most useful target transitions and target wavenumber regions for (re)measurement.

A docking algorithm [validated by re-docking GH5 from the GH5-chromatosome crystal structure (PDB: 4QLC) to the nucleosome] was used to dock the modelled domains to the same nucleosome template. In addition, GH1 (PDB: 1GHC) and a protein consisting of the N-terminal and globular domains of H1x (NGH1x) were also docked using this algorithm. Models of these docked structures are presented here in the form of PDB files. The models can be used to gain more insight with regards to the nucleosomal binding modes of H1s and their individual influence on chromatin compaction.",

The calculation was performed at the coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] level, with the full counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error and a large basis set including midpoint bond functions. The CCSD(T) potential is found to have two minima corresponding to the T-shaped and linear He-ONN structures. The T-shaped minimum is the global minimum. The two-dimensional discrete variable representation method was employed to calculate the rovibrational energy levels for (4)He-N(2)O and (3)He-N(2)O with N(2)O at its ground and nu(3) excited states.

It has been generally believed that dental enamel is an ectodermal derivative, whereas the dentin-pulp complex and the surrounding supporting tissues originate from NCC-derived mesenchyme. These traditional concepts stem mainly from several early studies of fishes and amphibians. Recently, Wnt1-Cre/R26R mice, a mouse model for NCC lineage analysis, revealed the contribution of NCCs to mammalian tooth development. However, the discrepancy of expression patterns between different NCC-specific transgenic mouse lines makes it compulsory to revisit the cell lineage in mammalian tooth development. Here, we reevaluated the NCC lineage during mouse tooth development by using P0-Cre/R26R mice, another NCC-specific transgenic mouse line. Inconsistent with the traditional concepts, we observed the potential contribution of NCCs to developing enamel organ and enamel formation. We also demonstrated that the P0-Cre transgene was specifically expressed in migrating NCC in the hindbrain region, where NCC contributes to tooth, validating their applicability for NCC lineage analysis. Our unanticipated finding may change the general understanding of tooth development and provide new insights into dental stem cell biology.",

This Faraday Discussion can assess the progress of CSP_0 over the range of types of materials to which CSP is currently and could be applied, which depends on our ability to model the variety of interatomic forces in crystals. The basic hypothesis, that the outcome of crystallisation is determined by thermodynamics, needs examining by considering methods of modelling relative thermodynamic stability not only as a function of pressure and temperature, but also of size, solvent and the presence of heterogeneous templates or impurities (CSP_thd).

Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H). Much less competitively, 1 (1a,1b) can undergo 3,4 H shift to form CH(2)CHCHCH 5.

The behavior of the nickel bis(dithiolene) complex Ni(S2C2(CF3)2)2 (1(_Ni)) as an electrocatalyst for this process was thoroughly explored experimentally and computationally. Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model. The reaction mechanism for these alternative catalysts was calculated to determine if any of these alternatives could block the decomposition route that exists for the Ni catalyst, bind ethylene efficiently to form the adducts, and release ethylene upon reduction. Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct. The reduction and oxidation processes involved in the reaction are computed to occur under reasonable experiment conditions. Among the copper complexes, the calculations predict that the anionic copper complex 1(_Cu)(-) also may be an alternative catalyst, whose performance is somewhat worse than 1(_Ni). The reaction of 1(_Cu)(-) with ethylene is predicted to be thermodynamically neutral. New catalysts that need no electrochemical regenerations may be possible by designing appropriate dithiolene ligands for 1(_Cu)(-).",

Subsequently, 5 can undergo either C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         ) (CH(2)CHCCH+H) or C-C bond cleavage to generate P                         (                            7                         ) (C(2)H(2)+C(2)H(3)).

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S). This (3)Π state and its bent components cross at medium RXC (RXN) distances the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of XCN(-) or XNC(-), and at shorter distances the X(2)Π state of the neutral XCN or XNC where the extra electron can detach. With both O and S atoms, it is shown that the spin-orbit couplings can efficiently lead the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction toward the stable X(1)Σ(+) ground state of XCN(-) and XNC(-). ",

The behavior of the nickel bis(dithiolene) complex Ni(S2C2(CF3)2)2 (1(_Ni)) as an electrocatalyst for this process was thoroughly explored experimentally and computationally. Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model. The reaction mechanism for these alternative catalysts was calculated to determine if any of these alternatives could block the decomposition route that exists for the Ni catalyst, bind ethylene efficiently to form the adducts, and release ethylene upon reduction. Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct. The reduction and oxidation processes involved in the reaction are computed to occur under reasonable experiment conditions. Among the copper complexes, the calculations predict that the anionic copper complex 1(_Cu)(-) also may be an alternative catalyst, whose performance is somewhat worse than 1(_Ni). The reaction of 1(_Cu)(-) with ethylene is predicted to be thermodynamically neutral. New catalysts that need no electrochemical regenerations may be possible by designing appropriate dithiolene ligands for 1(_Cu)(-).",

Although recent computational investigations have proposed that the OC-COH coupling pathway is more favorable in specific reaction conditions than the well-known CO dimerization pathway, the experimental evidence is still lacking, partly due to the separated catalyst design and mechanistic/spectroscopic exploration. Here, we employ density functional theory calculations to show that on low-coordinated copper sites, the *CO bindings are strengthened, and the adsorbed *CO coupling with their hydrogenation species, *COH, receives precedence over CO dimerization.

The CS2 + O2 reaction forms OCS + SO, with the lowest energy path involving crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. For CS + O2, which yields OCS + O, we found a high barrier to reaction, causing this step to be important only at elevated temperatures. The model predicts low temperature ignition delays and explosion limits accurately, whereas at higher temperatures it appears to overpredict both the induction time for CS2 oxidation and the formation rate of [O] upon ignition. The predictive capability of the model depends on the accuracy of the rate constant for the initiation step CS2 + O2, which is difficult to calculate due to the intersystem crossing, and the branching fraction for CS2 + O, which is measured only at low temperatures.

We tested this prediction in a partially purified Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase from pig kidney by means of rapid filtration to measure the occlusion using the K(+) congener Rb(+). Assuming that always two Rb(+) are occluded per enzyme, the steady-state levels of occluded forms and the kinetics of deocclusion were adequately described by the Albers-Post model over a very wide range of [ATP] and [Rb(+)]. The same happened with the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis.

Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model.

Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct.

Cl atom rate coefficients for reaction with n-CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]CH(CH2)3CN and n-CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]CH(CH2)4CN were determined as (2.95 ± 0.58) × 10-10 and (3.73 ± 0.60) × 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, respectively. CCl3COCl requires UV-C irradiation, so not all molecules are feasible for use in e.g. relative rate studies. Furthermore, it is recommended to perform experiments with O2 present, as this minimizes IR feature disturbance from product formation.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

The rearrangement of (CCCB)(-) is more favored via the triplet with equilibrating kite and fan structures being formed, whereas the singlet (CCCN)(+) ring closes to give the singlet kite structure, which may ring open to give a mixture of (CCCN)(+) and (CCNC)(+). Intersystem crossing may occur for the triplet and singlet forms of CCCC and (CCCB)(-) but not for (CCCN)(+).",

Various possible isomerization and dissociation pathways are probed. The initial association between C((3)P) and trans-C(4)H(8) is found to be the C((3)P) addition to the C=C bond of trans-C(4)H(8) to barrierlessly generate the three-membered cyclic isomer 1 CH(3)-cCHCCH-CH(3). Subsequently, 1 undergoes a ring-opening process to form the chainlike isomer 3a cis-trans-CH(3)CHCCHCH(3), which can either lead to P(6)((2)CH(3)CHCCCH(3) + (2)H) via the C-H bond cleavage or to P(7)((2)CH(3)CHCCH + (2)CH(3)) via C-C bond rupture.

Other channels leading to products P(1)((2)CH(3)-cCHCCH + (2)CH(3)), P(2)((2)CH(3)-cCHCC-CH(3) + (2)H), P(3)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(4)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(5)((3)CH(3)CH + (1)CH(3)CCH), P(8)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(9)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(10)((2)CH(3)CCCH(2) + (2)CH(3)), and P(11)((2)CH(3)CHCCHCH(2) + (2)H), however, are much less competitive due to either kinetic or thermodynamic factors. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the C((3)P) + trans-C(4)H(8) reaction all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

This value stands in stark contrast with the enthalpy of formation reported for thiane itself, Delta(f)H(o) m(g) = -63.5 +/- 1.0 kJ x mol(-1), and gives evidence of the increased electronegativity of the sulfur atom in the sulfonyl group, which leads to significantly stronger C-SO2 bonds. Given the known enthalpy of formation of atomic oxygen in the gas phase, Delta(f)H(o) m(O,g) = +249.18 kJ x mol(-1), and the reported bond dissociation energy for the S=O bond in alkyl sulfones, BDE(S=O) = +470.0 kJ x mol(-1), it was possible to estimate the enthalpy of formation of thiane sulfoxide, 5, a hygroscopic compound not easy to use in experimental calorimetric measurements, Delta(f)H(o) m(5) = -174.0 kJ x mol(-1). The experimental enthalpy of formation of both 4 and 5 were closely reproduced by theoretical calculations at the G2(MP2)+ level, Delta(f)H(o) m(4) = -395.0 kJ x mol(-1) and Delta(f)H(o) m(5) = -178.0 kJ x mol(-1).

In addition, the distribution of electron density of the HOMO states for the most stable Co(n)O clusters mainly localizes around Co(n) atoms while the distribution around O atom is very low, and their shapes of the HOMO and bonding properties between bare Co(n) clusters and Co(n)O clusters are obviously different.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions.

Several methods have been used by microbiologists, biotechnologists, and environmental engineers. This manuscript illustrates that these formulations are related. Yields predicted by estimation of Gibbs energy of dissipation and yields predicted by assumed efficiency of energy capture are comparable. Direct comparison of yield predictions from different methods shows the effects of assumptions inherent in the methodologies. Mathematical relationships between estimated values from the different methods help identify the best predictions from each method to bound the estimate of bacterial yield.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

This points to the presence of an extra ATP hydrolysis that is not Na(+)-ATPase activity and that does not involve occlusion. A possible way of explaining this is to posit that the binding of a single Rb(+) increases ATP hydrolysis without occlusion.",

The present work is concerned with understanding the yield of chemiluminescence, in particular how it dramatically increases upon methylation of 1,2-dioxetane. Both ground-state and nonadiabatic dynamics (including singlet excited states) of the decomposition reaction of various methyl-substituted dioxetanes have been simulated. Methyl-substitution leads to a significant increase in the dissociation time scale. The rotation around the O-C-C-O dihedral angle is slowed; thus, the molecular system stays longer in the \"entropic trap\" region. A simple kinetic model is proposed to explain how this leads to a higher chemiluminescence yield. These results have important implications for the design of efficient chemiluminescent systems in medical, environmental, and industrial applications.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-).

Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution. The trimetallic complex [Co(trpyn)O2COZn(OH2)4OCO2Co(trpyn)](ZnCl4)2.H2O crystallises on prolonged standing of [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4 in a neutral solution having [Zn2+]=1.0 M. The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer. This study highlights the rich mechanistic possibilities for metal mediated decarboxylation reactions involving ambidentate carboxylate ligands.",

La(3+) bound to a lesser extent than either Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) to OCN and, like Mg(2+), did not influence dimerization. Each Gla residue of OCN participates in Ca(2+) binding, whereas Mg(2+) binding may occur preferentially at sites other than Gla residues. This implies that the different natures of Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-containing OCN complexes influence the tendency of OCN to form a dimer.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

In general, PNOF5 bond energies are lower than the experimental ones, because of partial lack of dynamical electron correlation. However, the part of dynamical electron correlation recovered by PNOF5 allows it to give more accurate results than CASSCF methods with a minimum window required to treat near-degeneracy effects.

The product is isolated after repeated trap-to-trap condensation. The solid compound melts at -84 degrees C, and the extrapolated boiling point is 80 degrees C. ClC(O)OONO(2) is characterized by IR, Raman, (13)C NMR, and UV spectroscopy. According to the IR matrix spectra, the compound exists at room temperature only as a single conformer. The molecular structure of ClC(O)OONO(2) is determined by gas electron diffraction. The molecule possesses a gauche structure with a dihedral angle of phi(COON) = 86.7(19) degrees , and the C=O bond is oriented syn with respect to the O-O bond. The short O-O bond (1.418(6) A) and the long N-O bond (1.511(8) A) are consistent with the facile dissociation of ClC(O)OONO(2) into the radicals ClC(O)OO and NO(2). The experimental geometry of ClC(O)OONO(2) is reproduced reasonably well by B3LYP/6-311+G(2df) calculations, whereas the MP2 approximation predicts the N-O bond considerably too long and the dihedral angle too small.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

The origins of these differences between the ring expansion reactions of 1b and 1c have been elucidated through the calculation of the energies of relevant isodesmic reactions.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H). Much less competitively, 1 (1a,1b) can undergo 3,4 H shift to form CH(2)CHCHCH 5. Subsequently, 5 can undergo either C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         ) (CH(2)CHCCH+H) or C-C bond cleavage to generate P                         (                            7                         ) (C(2)H(2)+C(2)H(3)).

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

A popular computational paradigm formulates synthesis prediction as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, where the typical SMILES is adopted for molecule representations. However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions. We compare the proposed R-SMILES with various state-of-the-art baselines and show that it significantly outperforms them all, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.",

Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct.

Recent research attempts based on machine learning have proven to be effective in recommending reaction elements for specific categories regarding critical chemical context and operating conditions. However, existing methods can only make a single prediction per reaction and do not directly provide a complete specification of the reaction elements as the prediction. Therefore, their achievable performance is limited. In this study, we propose a generative modeling approach to predict multiple different reaction conditions for a chemical reaction, each of which fully specifies critical reaction elements such that these elements can be directly used as a feasible reaction condition. We formulate the problem of predicting reaction conditions as sampling from a generative distribution. We model the distribution by introducing a variational autoencoder augmented with a graph neural network and learn it from a reaction dataset. For a query reaction, multiple predictions can be obtained by repeated sampling from the distribution. Through experimental investigation on the reaction datasets of four major types of cross-coupling reactions, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in retrieving ground-truth reaction conditions.",

This Faraday Discussion can assess the progress of CSP_0 over the range of types of materials to which CSP is currently and could be applied, which depends on our ability to model the variety of interatomic forces in crystals. The basic hypothesis, that the outcome of crystallisation is determined by thermodynamics, needs examining by considering methods of modelling relative thermodynamic stability not only as a function of pressure and temperature, but also of size, solvent and the presence of heterogeneous templates or impurities (CSP_thd). Given that many important materials persist, and indeed may be formed, when they are not the most thermodynamically stable structure, we need to define what would be required of an ideal CSP code (CSP_aim).",

Highly diluted mixtures of NCN3 in argon were shock-heated to produce NCN, and concentration-time profiles of C atoms as reaction product were monitored with atomic resonance absorption spectroscopy at 156.1 nm. Calibration was performed with methane pyrolysis experiments. Rate coefficients for the reaction (3)NCN + M → (3)C + N2 + M (R1) were determined from the initial slopes of the C atom concentration-time profiles. Reaction R1 was found to be in the low-pressure regime at the conditions of the experiments. The temperature dependence of the bimolecular rate coefficient can be expressed with the following Arrhenius equation: k1(bim) = (4.2 ± 2.1) × 10(14) exp[-242.3 kJ mol(-1)/(RT)] cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1). The rate coefficients were analyzed by using a master equation with specific rate coefficients from RRKM theory. The necessary molecular data and energies were calculated with quantum chemical methods up to the CCSD(T)/CBS//CCSD/cc-pVTZ level of theory. From the topography of the potential energy surface, it follows that reaction R1 proceeds via isomerization of NCN to CNN and subsequent C-N bond fission along a collinear reaction coordinate without a tight transition state. The calculations reproduce the magnitude and temperature dependence of the rate coefficient and confirm that reaction R1 is in the low-pressure regime under our experimental conditions. ",

The inhibition of signaling pathways related to the stem cell nature of the CSCs may appear an attractive target for novel therapeutics, but these targets could result in significant unwanted off-target effects against essential healthy tissue stem cells. Instead, the ideal therapies targeting CSCs will be directed against functions that contribute to the oncogenic nature of CSCs relative to healthy stem cells, an altogether more challenging task.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction.

Various possible isomerization and dissociation pathways are probed. The initial association between C((3)P) and trans-C(4)H(8) is found to be the C((3)P) addition to the C=C bond of trans-C(4)H(8) to barrierlessly generate the three-membered cyclic isomer 1 CH(3)-cCHCCH-CH(3). Subsequently, 1 undergoes a ring-opening process to form the chainlike isomer 3a cis-trans-CH(3)CHCCHCH(3), which can either lead to P(6)((2)CH(3)CHCCCH(3) + (2)H) via the C-H bond cleavage or to P(7)((2)CH(3)CHCCH + (2)CH(3)) via C-C bond rupture. These two paths are the most favorable channels of the title reaction. Other channels leading to products P(1)((2)CH(3)-cCHCCH + (2)CH(3)), P(2)((2)CH(3)-cCHCC-CH(3) + (2)H), P(3)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(4)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(5)((3)CH(3)CH + (1)CH(3)CCH), P(8)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(9)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(10)((2)CH(3)CCCH(2) + (2)CH(3)), and P(11)((2)CH(3)CHCCHCH(2) + (2)H), however, are much less competitive due to either kinetic or thermodynamic factors. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the C((3)P) + trans-C(4)H(8) reaction all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

In this article, we report our detailed mechanistic study on the C(3)H+NO reaction at the Gussian-3//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level by constructing the singlet and triplet electronic state [H,C(3),N,O] potential energy surfaces (PESs). The l-C(3)H+NO reaction is shown to barrierlessly form the entrance isomer HCCCNO followed by the direct O-elimination leading to HCCCN+(3)O on triplet PES, or by successive O-transfer, N-insertion, and CN bond-rupture to generate the product (1)HCCN+CO on singlet PES. The possible singlet-triplet intersystem crossings are also discussed. Thus, the novel reaction l-C(3)H+NO can proceed effectively even at low temperatures and is expected to play an important role in both combustion and interstellar processes. For the c-C(3)H+NO reaction, the initially formed H-cCCC-NO can most favorably isomerize to HCCCNO, and further evolution follows that of the l-C(3)H+NO reaction. Quantitatively, the c-C(3)H+NO reaction can take place barrierlessly on singlet PES, yet it faces a small barrier 2.7 kcal/mol on triplet PES. The results will enrich our understanding of the chemistry of the simplest C(3)-radical in both combustion and interstellar processes, which to date have received little attention despite their importance and available abundant studies on its structural and spectroscopic properties.",

The experiments demonstrate that the chemical dynamics of ground state carbon reacting with diacetylene [HCCCCH(X (1)Sigma(g)(+))] are indirect and proceed via addition of the electrophilic carbon atom to the pi electron density of the diacetylene molecule yielding ultimately the carbenelike HCCCCCH(X (3)Sigma(g)(-)) molecule. This intermediate fragments via hydrogen atom emission to yield the 2,4-pentadiynylidyne [HCCCCC(X (2)Pi)] radical. The chemical dynamics elucidated also allows us to predict that reaction of carbon atoms with polyynes of the generic formula H(C[triple bond]C)(n)H leads to the formation of hydrogen-terminated carbon clusters of the generic form HC(2n+1) in extreme environments. The acetylene-related reactivity and electronic structure of the diacetylene molecule also allow us to project that reactions of the diacetylene molecule with cyano and ethynyl radicals result in a stepwise extension of the carbon skeleton forming cyanodiacetylene (HCCCCCN) and triacetylene (HCCCCCCH) plus atomic hydrogen.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

The assumption has been that terrestrial plants did not evolve CCMs for well over 300 million years, yet most marine plants probably evolved CCMs at the time when oxygenic photosynthesis first occurred in the Paleozoic. One primary reason for this assumption is that analysis of genetic mutations for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPc; an enzyme required for C4 and CAM photosynthesis) indicate a molecular age of no more than 65 Ma. Could the evolutionary response of both RuBisCO and PEPc to varying concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and O2 over geological time have obscured the real time when land plants first used PEPc during photosynthesis?",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)).

Notably, the method provides direct access to acyl-type radicals from unactivated amides under mild electron transfer conditions.",

We have developed a membrane inlet mass spectrometer method that simultaneously determines the rate of Rubisco carboxylation (v(c)) and oxygenation (v(o)), and the CO(2) and O(2) concentrations. Using the collected data, the Michaels-Menten equations for v(c) and v(o) in response to changing CO(2) and O(2) concentrations were simultaneously solved for the CO(2) (K(c)) and O(2) (K(o)) constants, the maximum turnover rates of the enzyme for CO(2) (kcat(CO2)) and O(2) (kcat(O2)) and the specificity for CO(2) relative to O(2) (S(c/o)). In the C(4) species Zea mays K(c) was higher but K(o) was lower compared with the C(3) species Triticum aestivum. The kcat(CO2) was higher and the kcat(O2) lower in Z. mays compared with T. aestivum and S(c/o) was similar in the two species. The V(omax)/V(cmax) was lower in Z. mays and thus did not correlate with changes in S(c/o). In conclusion, this mass spectrometer system provides a means of simultaneously determining the important Rubisco kinetic parameters, K(c), K(o), kcat(CO2,)kcat(O2) and S(c/o) from the same set of assays.",

The odontogenic marker genes and DSPP protein expression were more significantly up-regulated by the C3S/C2S composite material compared with pure CH and C3S. HDPCs cultured with composite material extract exert stronger ALP activity and alizarin red S staining. C3S/C2S composite material was advantageous over pure C3S by showing enhanced ability to stimulate the proliferation and odontogenic differentiation of hDPCs, suggesting that the C3S/C2S composite materials possess desirable biocompatibility and bioactivity, and might be a new type of pulp-capping agent and dentin alternative materials.",

According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

Unlike the comparable ring expansion of the (1)A(2) state of phenylnitrene (1b) to 1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraene (3b), ring expansion of 1c to 3c is computed to be quite endothermic. Nevertheless, cyclization of 1c, to form the bicyclic intermediate 2c in the ring expansion reaction, is computed to be only slightly more endothermic than the comparable cyclization reaction of 1b to 2b. The origins of these differences between the ring expansion reactions of 1b and 1c have been elucidated through the calculation of the energies of relevant isodesmic reactions.",

Crystal structure analyses show that each helix crystallizes in a hexagonal crystal system with space group Pc1 and the general axis of the helix occupies the crystallographic 3-fold axial position with the other three crystallographic 2-fold symmetries perpendicular to it. Each metal center is bound to three pyridylimine units to attain C3 pseudooctahedral coordination geometry with respective equivalent metal-N (CH=N) and metal-N (pyridyl) bonds. It is speculated that the existence of the methyl group might minimize the potential intermolecular interactions, which would be the essential factor controlling the helices formed in idealized crystallographic D3 symmetry.

All the results indicate that the existence of the methyl group in the side chain of aromatic ligands could effectively reduce the potential - intermolecular interactions and the side chain effect of the methyl group in crystal packing is robust enough to be exchanged from one network structure to another, which ensures the generality and predictability of the crystallographic idealized symmetry formation to a certain extent.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

The behavior of the nickel bis(dithiolene) complex Ni(S2C2(CF3)2)2 (1(_Ni)) as an electrocatalyst for this process was thoroughly explored experimentally and computationally. Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model. The reaction mechanism for these alternative catalysts was calculated to determine if any of these alternatives could block the decomposition route that exists for the Ni catalyst, bind ethylene efficiently to form the adducts, and release ethylene upon reduction. Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct. The reduction and oxidation processes involved in the reaction are computed to occur under reasonable experiment conditions. Among the copper complexes, the calculations predict that the anionic copper complex 1(_Cu)(-) also may be an alternative catalyst, whose performance is somewhat worse than 1(_Ni). The reaction of 1(_Cu)(-) with ethylene is predicted to be thermodynamically neutral. New catalysts that need no electrochemical regenerations may be possible by designing appropriate dithiolene ligands for 1(_Cu)(-).",

The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",

Calculations for various possible mixtures of CH4, CO2, CO, N2, H2, and H2O reveal that the prime species produced were probably HCN and NO and that the key parameter determining the rates of fixation was the ratio of C atoms to O atoms in the atmosphere. Atmospheres with C more abundant than O have large HCN fixation rates, in excess of 10(17) molecules J-1, but small NO yields. However, when O is more abundant than C, the NO fixation rate approaches 10(17) molecules J-1 while the HCN yield is small. The implications for the evolution of life are discussed.",

Since the electronic structure of Cu does not allow for the splitting of CO at such low temperatures it suggests that there may be a less obvious pathway for the process. Through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy we can clearly identify products associated with the dissociation of CO and the subsequent formation of stable graphitic carbon on the surface. However, the dissociation of CO can be inhibited when the stepped Cu surface is kept clean from surface carbon. These observations imply that the reaction is driven by the presence of small amounts of weakly bound carbon at the surface. Density-functional theory calculations confirm that carbon atoms on a stepped Cu surface indeed are the preferred adsorption sites for CO, which increases the stabilization of CO on the surface and weakens the C-O bond.

The ground state Sc atom reacts with two carbon dioxide molecules to give the carbonate carbonyl complex OCScCO3 via the previously reported OScCO insertion intermediate on annealing.

Compound 8 was prepared from [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(NtBu)] and Ph2CNNH2. DFT calculations were used to determine the nature of the bonding for the Ti=NNCPh2 moiety in 8 and in the previously reported [Cp2Ti(NNCPh2)(PMe3)].

Eighty extracted mandibular first molar teeth were randomly assigned to 4 groups (<in</i = 20) according to the endodontic access cavity shape and the single file system used for root canal preparation (reciprocating motion with the RCP B and rotary motion with the OC): TEC-RPC B, TEC-OC, CEC-RPC B, and CEC-OC.

Here, we found that this tRNA(Pro)(mo(5)UGG) can read not only the codons CCA, CCG and CCU but also CCC, using an in vitro assay system. This means that the first nucleoside of its anticodon, 5-methoxyuridine (mo(5)U), recognizes A, G, U and C.

Data on the frequency distribution of the individual COCSTOC measurements found in a natural population was subjected to a factor analysis which identified 18 occlusal patterns (combinations of traits) and five unique or independent traits or anomalies.",

These values were higher in individuals with normal occlusion than in patients with malocclusion and higher in patients with the Brachyo facial pattern than in those with the Dolico facial pattern. Because this system can very easily analyze the occlusal contact area, the mean pressure on each occlusal contact point, and the occlusal force during the process of orthodontic treatments, it can be useful as an aid for the initial diagnosis of occlusal problems, the observation of the changes in occlusion during treatment, and the establishment of the final goal of orthodontic treatments.",

Here we studied the expression of c-MYC in correlation to clinical outcome in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. <bMethods:</b The current study, using immunohistochemical staining, first examined c-MYC expression in OSCC patients and further correlated its expression with clinicopathological parameters. <bResults:</b c-MYC was expressed in the majority of OSCC patients (n=133). The c-MYC expression is associated with histological grade (<iP</i=0.0205) of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that TN stage (<iP</i&lt;0.001), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (<iP</i&lt;0.0001), and tumor differentiation (<iP</i=0.0025) were independent factors for overall survival in patients with OSCC except for c-MYC expression (<iP</i&gt;0.05). Multiplicative-scale interaction between T stage (III/IV) and low c-MYC expression on mortality risk was identified (<iP</i=0.0233).

The condition of exactness for n=2 defines nCCSD=2CC, with nCCSDT=3CC and nCCSDTQ=4CC being exact for three and four electrons. To achieve this, the minimum number of diagrams is evaluated, which is less than in the corresponding CC model. For all practical purposes, nCC is also the proper definition of a size-extensive CI. 2CC is also an orbitally invariant coupled electron pair approximation. The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result. As 2CC is exact for separated electron pairs, it is the natural zeroth-order approximation for the correlation problem in molecules with other effects introduced as these units start to interact. The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding. Excited states from the equation of motion (EOM-2CC) are also reported, which show results frequently approaching those of EOM-CCSDT.",

The effect of complement component 5a (C5a) on the differentiation of dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs) is related to dentin reparation. The aim of the present study was to stimulate DPSCs with different concentrations of C5a and evaluate the differentiation of odontoblasts using dentin sialoprotein (DSP). DPSCs were divided into the following six groups: (i) Control; (ii) DPSCs treated with 50 ng/ml C5a; (iii) DPSCs treated with 100 ng/ml C5a; (iv) DPSCs treated with 200 ng/ml C5a; (v) DPSCs treated with 300 ng/ml C5a; and (vi) DPSCs treated with 400 ng/ml C5a. Flow cytometry and multilineage differentiation potential were used to identify DPSCs. Mineralization induction, Real-time PCR and Western blot were conducted to evaluate the differentiation of odontoblast in the 6 groups. DPSCs can express mesenchymal stem cell markers, including CD105, CD90, CD73 and, a less common marker, mesenchymal stromal cell antigen-1. In addition, DPSCs can differentiate into adipocytes, neurocytes, chondrocytes and odontoblasts. All six groups formed mineralized nodules after 28 days of culture. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blotting indicated that the high concentration C5a groups expressed higher DSP levels and promoted DPSC differentiation, whereas the low concentration C5a groups displayed an inhibitory effect. In this study, the increasing concentration of C5a, which accompanies the immune process in the dental pulp, has demonstrated an enhancing effect on odontoblast differentiation at higher C5a concentrations in vitro.",

The average coordination number and distance of Zn species at different x(ZnCl(2)) (mole fraction of ZnCl(2) when synthesizing) were calculated. It is shown that x(ZnCl(2)) has a regular influence on the coordination number of Zn species, due to the change of anion forms and structures in the ChCl-ZnCl(2) ionic liquid. The possible forms and structures of Zn species in the ionic liquids were analyzed according to the coordination number. XAFS and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) analysis imply that besides ZnCl(3)(-) and Zn(2)Cl(5)(-) anions, the Cl-Zn-Cl ion pair is a main species in the ionic liquid at higher x(ZnCl(2)). This newly discovered Zn species has substantial influence on the properties of the ionic liquid. From the analysis of the coordination numbers and coordination distance, a new mechanism of interactions between Ch(+) cation and Cl-Zn-Cl ion pairs or Cl(-) is proposed.",

The condition of exactness for n=2 defines nCCSD=2CC, with nCCSDT=3CC and nCCSDTQ=4CC being exact for three and four electrons. To achieve this, the minimum number of diagrams is evaluated, which is less than in the corresponding CC model. For all practical purposes, nCC is also the proper definition of a size-extensive CI. 2CC is also an orbitally invariant coupled electron pair approximation. The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result. As 2CC is exact for separated electron pairs, it is the natural zeroth-order approximation for the correlation problem in molecules with other effects introduced as these units start to interact. The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding. Excited states from the equation of motion (EOM-2CC) are also reported, which show results frequently approaching those of EOM-CCSDT.",

In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

The Fermi-contact (FC) term probes the first-order density at the positions of the coupling nuclei, whereas the noncontact terms (the paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO) and the spin-dipole (SD) terms) probe the pi character of the C-C bond (the diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO) term can mostly be neglected). A model is tested, in which the value of the FC(CC) term is estimated with the help of measured SSCCs 1J(CH). The difference between the measured J(CC) and the estimated FC(CC) values, delta(CC) = PSO(CC) + SD(CC) + DSO(CC), provides a semiquantitative measure of the pi character of a C-C multiple bond.

The experimental first vertical ionization potential for CH(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), and CCl(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2) was determined to be 10.91, 11.42, and 11.07 eV, respectively.

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S). This (3)Π state and its bent components cross at medium RXC (RXN) distances the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of XCN(-) or XNC(-), and at shorter distances the X(2)Π state of the neutral XCN or XNC where the extra electron can detach. With both O and S atoms, it is shown that the spin-orbit couplings can efficiently lead the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction toward the stable X(1)Σ(+) ground state of XCN(-) and XNC(-). ",

According to the Arrhenius equation, the values of DeltaH(double dagger) and DeltaS(double dagger) (DeltaH(double dagger) = 9.7 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS(double dagger) = 35 J mol(-1) K(-1)) are obtained. The small value of DeltaH(double dagger) reveals that the reductive elimination step of Csp(2)-Ni-Csp(2) is an extremely facile process.",

However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions. We compare the proposed R-SMILES with various state-of-the-art baselines and show that it significantly outperforms them all, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

However once a double bond or a triple bond is added, the OO bending reaction dominates for both syn and anti-conformers. The rate coefficients for OO bending reaction show a significant increase when adding a methyl group or ethyl group.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS. CH(3)CN(+*) reacts by proton-transfer with CO(2) and charge transfer with COS, whereas CH(2)CNH(+*) is unreactive.",

However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions. We compare the proposed R-SMILES with various state-of-the-art baselines and show that it significantly outperforms them all, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.",

The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2.

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions.

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)).

To achieve near chemical accuracy (+/-1 kcal/mol), three corrections were added to the complete basis set binding energies based on frozen core coupled cluster theory energies: a correction for core-valence effects, a correction for scalar relativistic effects, and a correction for first-order atomic spin-orbit effects. Vibrational zero-point energies were computed at the CCSD(T) or MP2 levels. The edge inversion barrier of silane is predicted to be 88.9 kcal/mol at 298 K at the CCSD(T) level and a substantial amount, -63.6 kcal/mol, is recovered upon complexation with 2 NH(3) molecules, so that the diammoniosilane complex is only 25.6 kcal/mol at 298 K above the separated reactants SiH(4) + 2NH(3). The complex is a metastable species characterized by all real frequencies at the MP2/aV(T+d)Z level. We predict the heat of reaction for the sequential dehydrogenation of diammoniosilane to yield H(3)Si(NH(2))(NH(3)) and H(2)Si(NH(2))(2) to be exothermic by 33.6 and 12.2 kcal/mol at 298 K at the CCSD(T) level, respectively. The cumulative dehydrogenation reaction yielding two molecules of hydrogen at 298 K is -45.8 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T) level. The sequential release of H(2) from H(2)Si(NH(2))(2) consequently yielding HN=SiH(NH(2)) and HN=Si=NH are predicted to be largely endothermic reactions at 45.3 and 55.7 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T) level at 298 K. If the endothermic reaction for the third step and the exothermic reactions for the release of the first two H(2) were coupled effectively, loss of three H(2) molecules from H(4)Si(NH(3))(2) would be almost thermoneutral at 0 K.",

For all molecules, reference values are determined at the CC3//CC3 or CCSDR(3)//CCSDR(3) levels and the energetic and geometric effects are decomposed considering all possible methodological combinations between the five considered methods. For absorption, it is found that the errors are mainly energy-driven for ADC(2), CC2, and CCSDR(3), but not for CCSD. There is also an error compensation between the errors made on the geometries and transition energies for the two former approaches. For emission, the total errors are significantly larger than for absorption due to the significant increase of the structural component of the error. Therefore, the selection of a very refined method to compute the fluorescence energy will not systematically provide high accuracy if the excited-state geometry is not also optimized at a suitable level of theory. This is further demonstrated using results obtained from TD-DFT and hybrid TD-DFT/wave function protocols. We also found that, compared to full CC3, only CCSDR(3) is able to deliver errors below the 0.1 eV threshold, a statement holding for both absorption (mean absolute error of 0.033 eV) and emission (mean absolute error of 0.066 eV).",

The calculation was performed at the coupled-cluster [CCSD(T)] level, with the full counterpoise correction for the basis set superposition error and a large basis set including midpoint bond functions. The CCSD(T) potential is found to have two minima corresponding to the T-shaped and linear He-ONN structures. The T-shaped minimum is the global minimum. The two-dimensional discrete variable representation method was employed to calculate the rovibrational energy levels for (4)He-N(2)O and (3)He-N(2)O with N(2)O at its ground and nu(3) excited states. The results indicate that the CCSD(T) potential supports five and four vibrational bound states for the (4)He-N(2)O and (3)He-N(2)O, respectively. Moreover, the calculations on the line intensities of the rotational transitions in the nu(3) region of N(2)O for the ground vibrational state shows that the (3)He-N(2)O spectrum is dominated by a-type transitions (DeltaK(a)=0), while the (4)He-N(2)O spectrum is contributed by both the a-type and b-type (DeltaK(a)=+/-1) transitions.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

Depending upon the experimentally reported value of the rate for this reaction, the quantum efficiency is between 0.2 and 0.5.",

The calculations predict that the kinetically most favorable reaction proceeds with an activation barrier of 8.1 kcal mol(-1) via [3+2] addition across the O=Os=CH2 moiety. This reaction is -42.4 kcal mol(-1) exothermic. Alternatively, the [3+2] addition to the H2C=Os=CH2 fragment of 1 leads to the most stable addition product 4 (-72.7 kcal mol(-1)), yet this process has a higher activation barrier (13.0 kcal mol(-1)). The [3+2] addition to the O=Os=O fragment yielding 2 is kinetically (27.5 kcal mol(-1)) and thermodynamically (-7.0 kcal mol(-1)) the least favorable [3+2] reaction. The formal [2+2] addition to the Os=O and Os=CH2 double bonds proceeds by initial rearrangement of 1 to the metallaoxirane 1 a. The rearrangement 1--&gt;1 a and the following [2+2] additions have significantly higher activation barriers (&gt;30 kcal mol(-1)) than the [3+2] reactions. Another isomer of 1 is the dioxoosmacyclopropane 1 b, which is 56.2 kcal mol(-1) lower in energy than 1. The activation barrier for the 1--&gt;1 b isomerization is 15.7 kcal mol(-1). The calculations predict that there are no energetically favorable addition reactions of ethylene with 1 b. The isomeric form 1 c containing a peroxo group is too high in energy to be relevant for the reaction course. The accuracy of the B3LYP results is corroborated by high level post-HF CCSD(T) calculations for a subset of species.",

The CS2 + O2 reaction forms OCS + SO, with the lowest energy path involving crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. For CS + O2, which yields OCS + O, we found a high barrier to reaction, causing this step to be important only at elevated temperatures. The model predicts low temperature ignition delays and explosion limits accurately, whereas at higher temperatures it appears to overpredict both the induction time for CS2 oxidation and the formation rate of [O] upon ignition. The predictive capability of the model depends on the accuracy of the rate constant for the initiation step CS2 + O2, which is difficult to calculate due to the intersystem crossing, and the branching fraction for CS2 + O, which is measured only at low temperatures.

Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model.

Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct.

Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

The behavior of the nickel bis(dithiolene) complex Ni(S2C2(CF3)2)2 (1(_Ni)) as an electrocatalyst for this process was thoroughly explored experimentally and computationally. Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model. The reaction mechanism for these alternative catalysts was calculated to determine if any of these alternatives could block the decomposition route that exists for the Ni catalyst, bind ethylene efficiently to form the adducts, and release ethylene upon reduction. Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct. The reduction and oxidation processes involved in the reaction are computed to occur under reasonable experiment conditions. Among the copper complexes, the calculations predict that the anionic copper complex 1(_Cu)(-) also may be an alternative catalyst, whose performance is somewhat worse than 1(_Ni). The reaction of 1(_Cu)(-) with ethylene is predicted to be thermodynamically neutral. New catalysts that need no electrochemical regenerations may be possible by designing appropriate dithiolene ligands for 1(_Cu)(-).",

The CS2 + O2 reaction forms OCS + SO, with the lowest energy path involving crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. For CS + O2, which yields OCS + O, we found a high barrier to reaction, causing this step to be important only at elevated temperatures. The model predicts low temperature ignition delays and explosion limits accurately, whereas at higher temperatures it appears to overpredict both the induction time for CS2 oxidation and the formation rate of [O] upon ignition. The predictive capability of the model depends on the accuracy of the rate constant for the initiation step CS2 + O2, which is difficult to calculate due to the intersystem crossing, and the branching fraction for CS2 + O, which is measured only at low temperatures. The governing reaction mechanisms are outlined on the basis of calculations with the kinetic model. ",

The NBO/NRT results strongly support the general resonance-type three-center-four-electron (3c/4e) picture of LAuCCH: L(-): Au-CCH ↔ L-Au :CCH(-), arising from hyperconjugation interactions. The sums of ionic and covalent contributions to both L-Au and Au-CCH bonds are all slightly larger than that due to the additional π-back bonding within the 3c/4e hyperbonded triad. This complementary relationship between L-Au and Au-CCH bond orders implies a competing relationship between the ancillary ligand and CCH around the gold atom. We discuss the ligand effects in the LAuCCH(-) series on the basis of this competing relationship. ",

This review examines the current knowledge in CSC markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, ALDH1, phosphorylated STAT3, CD44, CD24, CD133, and Musashi-1, specifically focusing on their use and validity in OCSCC CSC research and how they may be organized into the CSC hierarchy.

The study group included patients with OSCC or oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD), and healthy volunteers (HVs). microarray and qRT-PCR were used to compare salivary CCL20 expression levels among groups. Data on CCL20 levels in oral cancer tissues and normal tissues were retrieved from a public database and examined. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing was used to investigate the salivary microbiome. A significant increase in the expression level of CCL20 was observed in both OSCC tissues and saliva from patients with oral cancer. Fusobacterium was identified as the predominant bacteria in OSCC and correlated with CCL20 expression level. OSCC screening based on salivary CCL20 expression enabled successful differentiation between patients with OSCC and HVs. CCL20 expression may be a useful biomarker for OSCC.",

However, the involvement of CAFs in oral cancer (OC) has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

The condition of exactness for n=2 defines nCCSD=2CC, with nCCSDT=3CC and nCCSDTQ=4CC being exact for three and four electrons. To achieve this, the minimum number of diagrams is evaluated, which is less than in the corresponding CC model. For all practical purposes, nCC is also the proper definition of a size-extensive CI. 2CC is also an orbitally invariant coupled electron pair approximation. The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result. As 2CC is exact for separated electron pairs, it is the natural zeroth-order approximation for the correlation problem in molecules with other effects introduced as these units start to interact. The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding. Excited states from the equation of motion (EOM-2CC) are also reported, which show results frequently approaching those of EOM-CCSDT.",

Therefore, we explored the reaction pathways of NO oxidation by NaClO2(s). Known concentrations of NO and NO2 in N2 balance were injected into packed-bed reactor containing NaClO2(s) at 130 degreesC. NaClO2(s) oxidized NO to NO2 which reacts again with NaClO2(s) to produce OClO. Comparison of experimental data with simulation results demonstrates that each NO2 molecule removed by the reaction with NaClO2(s) generated one OClO molecule, which also oxidized NO to NO2 with the production of ClNO and ClNO2. Using these results, we conclude that the oxidation of NO by NaClO2(s) occurred by two pathways. One is through the direct reaction of NO with NaClO(s).

Here, computational investigations with the ωB97X-D functional were conducted to explore alternative candidates [M(S2C2(CF3)2)2](n) (M = Co with n = 0, -1, -2, -3 and Cu with n = +1, 0, -1, -2) for olefin purification by using ethylene as a model.

Calculations predict that the neutral cobalt complex 1(_Co) binds and releases olefin upon reduction with low activation barriers. Furthermore, 1(_Co), unlike 1(_Ni), catalyzes the desired reaction without the need of the anion as a cocatalyst. The Co atom directly coordinates with ethylene more favorably than Ni, facilitating the indirect pathway that is found to lead to the formation of the desired interligand adduct.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)).

It is interesting to find that CO+NO on Cu(2)O(111) could react to form adsorbed NCO surface species. Coadsorption of CO and NO could give rise to the formation of a O-C...N-O complex well bound to the Cu(2)O(111) surface, in which both the C-O and N-O bonds are greatly activated and the C-N bond is formed. Consequently, the reaction of CO with NO to form adsorbed NCO and CNO species may occur, for which it is disclosed that NCO formation is more possible than CNO formation both thermodynamically and kinetically. In addition, our calculations of searching transition states reveal that it is facile for NCO formation both kinetically and thermodynamically when CO+NO reaction takes place at Cu(CUS) site, and is impossible when this reaction takes places at O(vac) site. Moreover, CO(2) species cannot form when CO+NO reaction occurs at O(vac) site.

The reaction progress profiles of arylzinc reagents exhibit zero-order kinetic behavior, and a reductive elimination step is confirmed as the rate-determining step. This allows direct measurement of the Csp(2)-Csp(2) reductive elimination rate constant within a catalytic cycle.

The inhibition of signaling pathways related to the stem cell nature of the CSCs may appear an attractive target for novel therapeutics, but these targets could result in significant unwanted off-target effects against essential healthy tissue stem cells. Instead, the ideal therapies targeting CSCs will be directed against functions that contribute to the oncogenic nature of CSCs relative to healthy stem cells, an altogether more challenging task.",

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)).

RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

The benzonitrile adduct (PhCN)Mo(N[t-Bu]Ar)3 (2-NCPh) reacts rapidly with H2SnR2 or 1-H to produce the ketimide complex (Ph(H)C=N)Mo(N[t-Bu]Ar)3 (2-NC(H)Ph). The X-ray crystal structures of both 2-H and 2-NC(H)Ph are reported. The enthalpy of reaction of 1-H and 2 in toluene solution has been measured by solution calorimetry (DeltaH = -13.1 +/- 0.7 kcal mol(-1)) and used to estimate the Mo-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) in 2-H as 62 kcal mol(-1). The enthalpy of reaction of 1-H and 2-NCPh in toluene solution was determined calorimetrically as DeltaH = -35.1 +/- 2.1 kcal mol(-1). This value combined with the enthalpy of hydrogenation of [Mo(CO)3(Cp)]2 (1(2)) gives an estimated value of 90 kcal mol(-1) for the BDE of the ketimide C-H of 2-NC(H)Ph. These data led to the prediction that formation of 2-NC(H)Ph via nitrile insertion into 2-H would be exothermic by approximately 36 kcal mol(-1), and this reaction was observed experimentally. Stopped flow kinetic studies of the rapid reaction of 1-H with 2-NCPh yielded DeltaH(double dagger) = 11.9 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS(double dagger) = -2.7 +/- 1.2 cal K(-1) mol(-1). Corresponding studies with DMo(CO)3(Cp) (1-D) showed a normal kinetic isotope effect with kH/kD approximately 1.6, DeltaH(double dagger) = 13.1 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1) and DeltaS(double dagger) = 1.1 +/- 1.6 cal K(-1) mol(-1). Spectroscopic studies of the much slower reaction of 1-H and 2 yielding 2-H and 1/2 1(2) showed generation of variable amounts of a complex proposed to be (Ar[t-Bu]N)3Mo-Mo(CO)3(Cp) (1-2). Complex 1-2 can also be formed in small equilibrium amounts by direct reaction of excess 2 and 1(2). The presence of 1-2 complicates the kinetic picture; however, in the presence of excess 2, the second-order rate constant for H atom transfer from 1-H has been measured: 0.09 +/- 0.01 M(-1) s(-1) at 1.3 degrees C and 0.26 +/- 0.04 M(-1) s(-1) at 17 degrees C. Study of the rate of reaction of 1-D yielded kH/kD = 1.00 +/- 0.05 consistent with an early transition state in which formation of the adduct (Ar[t-Bu]N)3Mo...HMo(CO)3(Cp) is rate limiting.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

First, a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to obtain a realistic structure of the CAS-Fe(IV)=O-succinate-substrate complex; then potential of mean force (PMF) was calculated to assess the feasibility of the beta-lactam ring, more specifically its C4' corner, approaching the oxo atom. Based on the MD structure, a relatively large model of the active site region was selected and used in the B3LYP investigation of the reaction mechanism. The computational results suggest that once the oxoferryl species is formed, the oxidative cyclization catalyzed by CAS most likely involves either a mechanism involving C4'(S)-H bond cleavage of the monocyclic beta-lactam ring, or a biosynthetically unprecedented mechanism comprising (1) oxidation of the hydroxyl group of PCA to an O-radical, (2) retro-aldol-like decomposition of the O-radical to an aldehyde and a C-centered radical, which is stabilized by the captodative effect, (3) abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the C4'(S) position of the C-centered radical by the Fe(III)-OH species yielding an azomethine ylide, and (4) 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to the ylide with aldehyde acting as a dipolarophile.

The CASPT2//CASSCF calculations predict that the S(3) state is initially populated and the subsequent deprotonation of [Cp(2)Os-OH](+) proceeds very easily along the T(1) pathway as a result of the efficient S(3) → T(1) intersystem crossing. It is found that the O-O bond is formed via the acid-base mechanism, which is different from the direct oxo-oxo coupling mechanism suggested in the experimental study. Formation of the O-O bond is the rate-determining step and has an activation energy and activation free energy of 81.3 and 90.4 kcal/mol, respectively. This is consistent with the low quantum yield observed for generating molecular oxygen upon irradiation at 350 nm (~ 82 kcal/mol). The O(2) release from an intermediate complex has to overcome a small barrier on the triplet pathway first and then pass through the triplet-singlet intersection, generating the O(2) molecules in either the lowest singlet or triplet state. The formed (3)O(2) molecule can be converted into the (1)O(2) molecule by the heavy atom effect in the Os complexes, which is probably the reason only the (1)O(2) molecule was detected experimentally.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

This value combined with the enthalpy of hydrogenation of [Mo(CO)3(Cp)]2 (1(2)) gives an estimated value of 90 kcal mol(-1) for the BDE of the ketimide C-H of 2-NC(H)Ph. These data led to the prediction that formation of 2-NC(H)Ph via nitrile insertion into 2-H would be exothermic by approximately 36 kcal mol(-1), and this reaction was observed experimentally. Stopped flow kinetic studies of the rapid reaction of 1-H with 2-NCPh yielded DeltaH(double dagger) = 11.9 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS(double dagger) = -2.7 +/- 1.2 cal K(-1) mol(-1). Corresponding studies with DMo(CO)3(Cp) (1-D) showed a normal kinetic isotope effect with kH/kD approximately 1.6, DeltaH(double dagger) = 13.1 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1) and DeltaS(double dagger) = 1.1 +/- 1.6 cal K(-1) mol(-1). Spectroscopic studies of the much slower reaction of 1-H and 2 yielding 2-H and 1/2 1(2) showed generation of variable amounts of a complex proposed to be (Ar[t-Bu]N)3Mo-Mo(CO)3(Cp) (1-2). Complex 1-2 can also be formed in small equilibrium amounts by direct reaction of excess 2 and 1(2). The presence of 1-2 complicates the kinetic picture; however, in the presence of excess 2, the second-order rate constant for H atom transfer from 1-H has been measured: 0.09 +/- 0.01 M(-1) s(-1) at 1.3 degrees C and 0.26 +/- 0.04 M(-1) s(-1) at 17 degrees C. Study of the rate of reaction of 1-D yielded kH/kD = 1.00 +/- 0.05 consistent with an early transition state in which formation of the adduct (Ar[t-Bu]N)3Mo...HMo(CO)3(Cp) is rate limiting.",

The complexes contain [Co(4)O(2)(OH)(2)](6+) (5) and [Co(4)O(3)(OH)](5+) (6) distorted-cubane cores, the sites of protonation being apparent by (i) the approach of ClO(4)(-) or [Ce(NO(3))(6)](3)(-) anions to within hydrogen-bonding distances (O.O approximately 2.7 Å) and (ii) the longer Co-OH(-) bond lengths compared with Co-O(2)(-) bond lengths. Peripheral ligation is provided by chelating bpy and syn,syn-bridging RCO(2)(-) groups. The Co(III) atoms are six-coordinate and approximately octahedral. Solution studies show that the diprotonated species is a strong diprotic acid analogous to H(2)SO(4); the first deprotonation goes to completion, but the monoprotonated species is a weak acid and is in equilibirium with the nonprotonated species. pH studies in aqueous solution yield a pK(a2) value of 3.15 for the second deprotonation. Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution. The combined results demonstrate that the [Co(4)O(4)](4+) core is capable of acting as a Brønsted base, undergoing either one or two protonation reactions.",

Evidence for a metal-based active intermediate.\nThe oxidation of alkanes by various peroxides ((t)BuOOH, H2O2, PhCH2C(CH3)2OOH) is efficiently catalyzed by [Os(VI)(N)Cl4](-)/Lewis acid (FeCl3 or Sc(OTf)3) in CH2Cl2/CH3CO2H to give alcohols and ketones. Oxidations occur rapidly at ambient conditions, and excellent yields and turnover numbers of over 7500 and 1000 can be achieved in the oxidation of cyclohexane with (t)BuOOH and H2O2, respectively. In particular, this catalytic system can utilize PhCH2C(CH3)2OOH (MPPH) efficiently as the terminal oxidant; good yields of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone (&gt;70%) and MPPOH (&gt;90%) are obtained in the oxidation of cyclohexane. This suggests that the mechanism does not involve alkoxy radicals derived from homolytic cleavage of MPPH but is consistent with heterolytic cleavage of MPPH to produce a metal-based active intermediate. The following evidence also shows that no free alkyl radicals are produced in the catalytic oxidation of alkanes: (1) The product yields and distributions are only slightly affected by the presence of O2. (2) Addition of BrCCl3 does not affect the yields of cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone in the oxidation of cyclohexane. (3) A complete retention of stereochemistry occurs in the hydroxylation of cis- and trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. The proposed mechanism involves initial O-atom transfer from ROOH to [Os(VI)(N)Cl4](-)/Lewis acid to generate [Os(VIII)(N)(O)Cl4](-)/Lewis acid, which then oxidizes alkanes via H-atom abstraction.",

The reaction proceeds with C-N bond cleavage in the carbinolamine intermediate, shows excellent functional group tolerance, and delivers the alcohol products in very high yields. The expected C-O cleavage products are not formed under the reaction conditions. The observed reactivity is opposite to the electrophilicity of polar carbonyl groups resulting from the n(X) → π*(C═O) (X = O, N) conjugation. Mechanistic studies suggest that coordination of Sm to the carbonyl and then to Lewis basic nitrogen in the tetrahedral intermediate facilitate electron transfer and control the selectivity of the C-N/C-O cleavage.

This issue, generally agreed upon to be caused by an intermediate 1,2-oxazoline, is often bypassed by introducing extra synthetic steps to avoid the presence of the NHAc functional group during glycosylation. The present paper describes new fundamental mechanistic insights into the inherent challenges of performing direct glycosylation with GlcNAc. These results show that controlling the balance of oxazoline formation and glycosylation is key to achieving acceptable chemical yields. By applying this line of reasoning to direct glycosylation with a traditional thioglycoside donor of GlcNAc, which otherwise affords poor glycosylation yields, one may obtain useful glycosylation results.",

Using spectroscopic networks and tools of graph theory, CSC helps to find the most useful target transitions and target wavenumber regions for (re)measurement.

It is observed that PNOF5 is able to treat the strong electron correlation effects along the homolysis of X-H (X = C, N, O) and X-X (X = C, O) bonds, leading, in general, to the correct trends in the corresponding bond strengths and a good description of the resultant electronic structure for these radicals. In general, PNOF5 bond energies are lower than the experimental ones, because of partial lack of dynamical electron correlation. However, the part of dynamical electron correlation recovered by PNOF5 allows it to give more accurate results than CASSCF methods with a minimum window required to treat near-degeneracy effects. In addition, inspection of the natural orbital occupancies with respect to the CASSCF ones shows an outstanding performance of PNOF5 in treating degenerate and quasidegenerate states, giving a correct description of diradicals and diradicaloids formed upon C-C cleavage in cyclopropane and derivatives.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete.

Mg(2+) bound to OCN to the same extent as Ca(2+) but did not induce the dimerization of OCN. La(3+) bound to a lesser extent than either Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) to OCN and, like Mg(2+), did not influence dimerization. Each Gla residue of OCN participates in Ca(2+) binding, whereas Mg(2+) binding may occur preferentially at sites other than Gla residues. This implies that the different natures of Ca(2+)- and Mg(2+)-containing OCN complexes influence the tendency of OCN to form a dimer.",

Each metal center is bound to three pyridylimine units to attain C3 pseudooctahedral coordination geometry with respective equivalent metal-N (CH=N) and metal-N (pyridyl) bonds.

By tracing the atomic hydrogen and deuterium loss pathways, our experimental data suggest indirect scattering dynamics and an initial addition of the (D1)-methylidyne radical to the carbon-carbon double bond of the (D4)-ethylene reactant forming a cyclopropyl radical intermediate (c-C(3)H(5)/c-C(3)D(4)H/c-C(3)H(4)D).

This intermediate was found to be long lived with life times of at least five times its rotational period and decomposed via atomic hydrogen/deuterium loss from the central carbon atom (C2) to form allene via a rather loose exit transition state in an overall strongly exoergic reaction. Based on the experiments with partially deuterated reactants, no compelling evidence could be provided to support the formation of the cyclopropene and methylacetylene isomers under single collision conditions. Likewise, hydrogen/deuterium shifts in the allyl radical intermediates or an initial insertion of the (D1)-methylidyne radical into the carbon-hydrogen/deuterium bond of the (D4)-ethylene reactant were found to be-if at all-of minor importance.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

The effect of complete transformation is based on both the selectivity and particular energy dependence of the initial step of the reaction which is dissociative electron attachment to C(2)F(4)C(l2), but also the fact that the initial molecule is efficiently decomposed by subexcitation electrons while the product C(l2) is virtually unaffected.",

A popular computational paradigm formulates synthesis prediction as a sequence-to-sequence translation problem, where the typical SMILES is adopted for molecule representations. However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions. We compare the proposed R-SMILES with various state-of-the-art baselines and show that it significantly outperforms them all, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.",

The expected C-O cleavage products are not formed under the reaction conditions. The observed reactivity is opposite to the electrophilicity of polar carbonyl groups resulting from the n(X) → π*(C═O) (X = O, N) conjugation.

When the acetate is flanked by two equatorial substituents the preferred conformation is close to eclipsed. Over 1500 C-OAc bonds have been analyzed.

However, the general-purpose SMILES neglects the characteristics of chemical reactions, where the molecular graph topology is largely unaltered from reactants to products, resulting in the suboptimal performance of SMILES if straightforwardly applied. In this article, we propose the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned one-to-one mapping between the product and the reactant SMILES for more efficient synthesis prediction. Due to the strict one-to-one mapping and reduced edit distance, the computational model is largely relieved from learning the complex syntax and dedicated to learning the chemical knowledge for reactions. We compare the proposed R-SMILES with various state-of-the-art baselines and show that it significantly outperforms them all, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.",

When the acetate is flanked by two equatorial substituents the preferred conformation is close to eclipsed. Over 1500 C-OAc bonds have been analyzed. Diagnostic NMR criteria for torsion angles and MM3 calculations are reported and confirm these conclusions.",

Given that many important materials persist, and indeed may be formed, when they are not the most thermodynamically stable structure, we need to define what would be required of an ideal CSP code (CSP_aim).",

HCO radical and H atom yields have been quantified by time resolved continuous wave Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy in the near infrared following their conversion to HO2 radicals by reaction with O2. The CH3 radical yield has been determined using the same technique following their conversion into CH3O2. Absolute yields have been deduced for HCO radicals and H atoms through fitting of time resolved HO2 profiles, obtained under various O2 concentrations, to a complex model, while the CH3 yield has been determined relative to the CH3 yield from 248 nm photolysis of CH3I. Time resolved HO2 profiles under very low O2 concentrations suggest that another unknown HO2 forming reaction path exists in this reaction system besides the conversion of HCO radicals and H atoms by reaction with O2. HO2 profiles can be well reproduced under a large range of experimental conditions with the following quantum yields: CH3CHO + hν(248nm) → CH3CHO*, CH3CHO* → CH3 + HCO ϕ(1a) = 0.125 ± 0.03, CH3CHO* → CH3 + H + CO ϕ(1e) = 0.205 ± 0.04, CH3CHO*[Formula: see text]CH3CO + HO2 ϕ(1f) = 0.07 ± 0.01. The CH3O2 quantum yield has been determined in separate experiments as ϕ(CH₃) = 0.33 ± 0.03 and is in excellent agreement with the CH3 yields derived from the HO2 measurements considering that the triple fragmentation (R1e) is an important reaction path in the 248 nm photolysis of CH3CHO. From arithmetic considerations taking into account the HO2 and CH3 measurements we deduce a remaining quantum yield for the molecular pathway: CH3CHO* → CH4 + CO ϕ(1b) = 0.6. All experiments can be consistently explained with absence of the formerly considered pathway: CH3CHO* → CH3CO + H ϕ(1c) = 0.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

Molecular constants including the hyperfine interaction constants of CH2=CCHO in the (2)A(″) ground electronic state were precisely determined. Ab initio calculations indicate that CH2=CCHO has a linear C-C-C backbone with Cs symmetry, where the formyl group is in the Cs plane and perpendicular to the methylene group. The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom. The ground state CH2=CCHO can, thus, be described as taking the formylvinyl (CH2=Ċ-CH=O) form rather than as the allenyloxy (CH2=C=CH-Ȯ) form. ",

Vibrational frequencies of the reactants and products of these silica surfaces reacting with H(2)O have been calculated and compare favorably with experiment. Comparisons of the Gibbs free and potential energies for the model ionic and radical states were made, and the radical pair of sites was predicted to be more stable by approximately -70 to -85 kJ/mol, depending on the computational methodology. These calculations suggest that when silica is fractured in a vacuum homolytic cleavage is favored. Reaction pathways were investigated for these four model surface sites interacting with H(2)O. The reaction of H(2)O with triple bond SiO(*) was predicted to generate OH(*). Rate constants for these reactions were also calculated and predict a rapid equibrium for the reaction triple bond SiO(*) + H(2)O --&gt; triple bond SiOH + OH(*). Stability of a finite number of triple bond SiO(*) sites at equilibrium in the above reaction with H(2)O was also predicted, which implies a long-term ability of silica surfaces to produce OH(*) radicals if the sites of the broken bonds do not repolymerize to form siloxane groups.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

Various possible isomerization and dissociation pathways are probed. The initial association between C((3)P) and trans-C(4)H(8) is found to be the C((3)P) addition to the C=C bond of trans-C(4)H(8) to barrierlessly generate the three-membered cyclic isomer 1 CH(3)-cCHCCH-CH(3). Subsequently, 1 undergoes a ring-opening process to form the chainlike isomer 3a cis-trans-CH(3)CHCCHCH(3), which can either lead to P(6)((2)CH(3)CHCCCH(3) + (2)H) via the C-H bond cleavage or to P(7)((2)CH(3)CHCCH + (2)CH(3)) via C-C bond rupture.

The majority of these complexes undergo clean C-O bond-forming reductive elimination, and the mechanism of this process has been investigated. A variety of experiments, including Hammett plots, Eyring analysis, crossover studies, and investigations of the influence of solvent and additives, suggest that C-O bond-forming reductive elimination proceeds via initial carboxylate dissociation followed by C-O coupling from a 5-coordinate cationic Pd(IV) intermediate. The mechanism of competing C-C bond-forming reductive elimination from these complexes has also been investigated and is proposed to involve direct reductive elimination from the octahedral Pd(IV) centers.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

Because initially formed 1:1 Cu/O2 adducts resulting from reactions of Cu(I) sites with O2 react relatively sluggishly with substrates with strong C-H bonds, it has been suggested that reductive O-O bond scission might occur instead to yield more reactive [CuO](+) or protonated [CuOH](2+) cores. Experimental and theoretical studies of [CuO](+) species in the gas phase have provided key insights into the possible reactivity of these species, but detailed information is lacking for discrete complexes with the [CuO](+) or [CuOH](2+) core in solution or the solid state. We describe herein our recent efforts to address this issue through several disparate approaches. In one strategy based on precedent from studies of enzymes and synthetic compounds with iron-α-ketocarboxylate motifs, reactions of O2 with Cu(I)-α-ketocarboxylate complexes were explored, with the aim of identifying reaction pathways that would implicate the intermediacy of a [CuO](+) species. A second approach focused on the reaction of N-oxides with Cu(I) complexes, with the goal being to elicit O-N bond heterolysis to yield [CuO](+) complexes. For both strategies, the course of the reactions depended on the nature of the supporting bidentate N-donor ligand, and indirect evidence in support of the sought-after [CuO](+) intermediates was obtained in some instances. In the final approach discussed herein, strongly electron donating and sterically encumbered pyridine-dicarboxamide ligands (L) enabled the synthesis of [LCu(II)OH](-) complexes, which upon one-electron oxidation formed complexes with the [CuOH](2+) core that were characterized in solution. Rapid hydrogen atom abstraction (HAT) from dihydroanthracene (DHA) was observed, yielding LCu(II)OH2. The O-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of ∼90 kcal/mol for this complex was determined through evaluation of its pKa (∼19) and the [LCu(II)OH](-)/LCu(III)OH reduction potential (approximately -0.08 V vs Fc/Fc(+)). Thus, the poor oxidizing power of the complex is offset by the high basicity of the hydroxide moiety to yield a strong O-H bond. This high BDE provided a thermodynamic rationale for the rapid HAT rate from DHA and suggested that stronger C-H bonds could be attacked. Indeed, using an inert solvent (1,2-difluorobenzene), substrates with C-H bond strengths as high as 99 kcal/mol were shown to react with the [CuOH](2+) complex, and a linear log k vs C-H BDE plot supported similar HAT pathways across the series. Importantly, these results provided key evidence in favor of the possible intermediacy of this core in oxidation catalysis, and we suggest that because it is a more energetically accessible intermediate than the [CuO](+) moiety, it should be considered as an alternative in proposed mechanisms for oxidations by enzymes and other synthetic systems.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration.

A DFT structural study conducted on the cations of the methyl-substituted 5-membered nickelacycle 2a and the mesityl-substituted 6-membered cycle 2c found a small energetic cost (ΔG = 7-12 kcal mol<sup-1</sup) for the loss of one acetonitrile ligand from the square-planar structures existing in solution, that should be easily amenable upon solvent evaporation (ΔG<sup‡</sup = 14 kcal mol<sup-1</sup in the case of 2c). Two structures with one acetonitrile ligand could be optimized in both cases: (i) a truly T-shaped 14-electron structure with an end-on acetonitrile ligand, and (ii) a masked T-shaped structure stabilized by the π-coordination of the dangling CN group of the metallated alkyl chain, the latter being favoured by 2.4 kcal mol<sup-1</sup in the case of the flexible 6-membered ring 2c. A comparison of calculated vibrational frequencies with experimental FTIR spectra ruled out π-coordination of the dangling CN group as a ν(C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N) band at low frequency was absent. Complexes 2a-d thus probably exist as rare three-coordinate T-shaped 14-electron species in the solid state. Their catalytic activity was studied for the direct arylation of azoles, and 2c proved to be moderately active for the coupling of benzothiazole with aryl iodides. Mechanistic insights suggest that competing processes or a radical process catalysed by nickel particles could follow an initial reduction of 2c by the dimerization of a sacrificial amount of benzothiazole.",

The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

For the CH+NO reaction, the relative branching ratio sigma(NCO*)sigma(NH) of NCO(A (2)Sigma(+)) formation to NH(A (3)Pi) formation was determined to be 0.35+/-0.15. The state-selected reaction cross sections were determined for each rotational state of CH. In the CH+NO reaction, a remarkable rotational state dependence of the reactive cross section was revealed, while the CH+O(2) reaction showed little rotational state dependence.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-).

Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

The quadratic force constants and the stretching potentials of Hn CCHn have been calculated at the CASSCF/cc-pVTZ level. The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

HC(O)H and 3,3-dimethylbutanal [(CH3)3CCH2C(O)H] are identified in our calculations as major products in the OH-radical-initiated degradation of DMP441 in the presence of O2. However, the epoxide conformers and enols are expected to be minor products because of the high isomerization barriers involved. The calculated results are in qualitative accordance with experimental evidence. Conventional transition state theory has been used to calculate the rate constants of the initial addition channels of the OH + DMP441 reaction over the temperature range 220-500 K. The computed total rate constant at 298 K is 2.20 × 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), which is in very good agreement with the experimental value. Furthermore, it has been found that the calculated rate constant exhibits a weak non-Arrhenius behavior over the temperature range 220-500 K. The computed expression for the rate constant is k(OH+DMP441) = 1.22 × 10(-12) exp[(880 K)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). ",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

Various possible isomerization and dissociation pathways are probed. The initial association between C((3)P) and trans-C(4)H(8) is found to be the C((3)P) addition to the C=C bond of trans-C(4)H(8) to barrierlessly generate the three-membered cyclic isomer 1 CH(3)-cCHCCH-CH(3). Subsequently, 1 undergoes a ring-opening process to form the chainlike isomer 3a cis-trans-CH(3)CHCCHCH(3), which can either lead to P(6)((2)CH(3)CHCCCH(3) + (2)H) via the C-H bond cleavage or to P(7)((2)CH(3)CHCCH + (2)CH(3)) via C-C bond rupture. These two paths are the most favorable channels of the title reaction. Other channels leading to products P(1)((2)CH(3)-cCHCCH + (2)CH(3)), P(2)((2)CH(3)-cCHCC-CH(3) + (2)H), P(3)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(4)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(5)((3)CH(3)CH + (1)CH(3)CCH), P(8)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(9)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(10)((2)CH(3)CCCH(2) + (2)CH(3)), and P(11)((2)CH(3)CHCCHCH(2) + (2)H), however, are much less competitive due to either kinetic or thermodynamic factors. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the C((3)P) + trans-C(4)H(8) reaction all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

An ab initio study at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory indicates that (i) triplet NCCCCCN is the ground state with a T/S energy gap of -14.9 kcal mol(-1); (ii) the structures of triplet and singlet NCCCCCN need to be described by molecular obital theory, and a simple valence bond approach cannot be used for this system; and (iii) there are several possible routes by which an energized neutral may lose carbon, but the major route involves the triplet nitrile to isonitrile rearrangement NCCCCCN --&gt; CNCCCCN --&gt; NCCCCN + C.",

A three-dimensional potential energy surface (PES) for CCl2 addition to cyclooctyne (B3LYP/6-31G*) shows the formation of the cyclopropene product and also possible formation of a vinylcarbene. Residing in a shallow energy well, the vinylcarbene easily rearranges to the cyclopropene product, or to an exocyclic vinyl bicyclo[3.3.0]octane. Although the calculated three-dimensional PES indicates possible dynamic control of the cyclooctyne-chlorocarbene system through the putative formation of a vinylcarbene (in addition to the expected cyclopropene), additional calculations and preliminary experimental work show paths through the vinylcarbene to be unlikely. If the additions of chlorocarbenes to cyclooctyne are controlled by reaction dynamics, we predict that the vast majority of the reactions proceed via traditional carbene cycloaddition with only a very minor amount of products formed from the alternative pathway.",

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer. This study highlights the rich mechanistic possibilities for metal mediated decarboxylation reactions involving ambidentate carboxylate ligands.",

Molecular constants including the hyperfine interaction constants of CH2=CCHO in the (2)A(″) ground electronic state were precisely determined. Ab initio calculations indicate that CH2=CCHO has a linear C-C-C backbone with Cs symmetry, where the formyl group is in the Cs plane and perpendicular to the methylene group. The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom. The ground state CH2=CCHO can, thus, be described as taking the formylvinyl (CH2=Ċ-CH=O) form rather than as the allenyloxy (CH2=C=CH-Ȯ) form. ",
