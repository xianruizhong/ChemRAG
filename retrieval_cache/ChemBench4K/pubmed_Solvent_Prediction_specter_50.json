Unfortunately, organic solvents make up most of the organic waste created by the chemical enterprise, whether from academic, industrial, or governmental labs. One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water.

A number of reactions may be achieved in a single pot, accompanied by the formation of new rings and new bonds, leading towards higher molecular complexity. A lack of one unified, yet informative descriptor often understates the synthetic ingenuity of certain highly creative transformations. In this review, we propose a new tetra-coordinated [a,b,c,d] nomenclature which takes into account and displays the basic parameters which generally indicate the level of efficiency of a chemical transformation. An almost exhaustive set of one-pot multistep reactions may be described by this system and this review is an attempt to display the one-pot multistep transformations reported from our group and to classify them based on our proposed descriptor.",

With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

A third Guareschi reaction, the so-called \"Guareschi 1897 reaction\", is one of the most unusual reactions in organic chemistry, involving the radical-mediated paradoxical aerobic generation of hydrocarbons in near-neutral water solution. A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

Finally, the bond strengths and ionization potentials for the title compounds were determined by density functional theory calculations, which also suggest that the alpha-methylenic hydrogen is mainly under abstraction by Cl atoms. The correlation of room-temperature rate coefficients with ionization potentials for a set of 27 molecules, comprising fluorinated C2-C5 ethers and C2-C4 alcohols, is good with an average deviation of a factor of 2, and is given by the expression log(k) (in cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)) = (5.8 +/- 1.4) - (1.56 +/- 0.13) x (ionization potential (in eV)).",

In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

In all cases, the water content versus rate profile shows a maximum at around 0.2 M H2 O. The rate versus amine content profile shows in all cases, except for benzyl chloride, saturation behavior, which is typical of a change in the identity of the rate-determining step. The mechanism that is in agreement with the observed data is that electron transfer occurs in the first step. With substrates that are not very electrophilic, the intermediate radical anions lose the added electron back to samarium(III) relatively quickly and the reaction cannot progress efficiently. However, in a mixture of water/amine, the amine deprotonates a molecule of water coordinated to samarium(III). The negatively charged hydroxide, which is coordinated to samarium(III), reduces its electrophilicity, and therefore, lowers the rate of back electron transfer, which allows the reaction to progress. In the case of benzyl chloride, in which electron transfer is rate determining, deprotonation by the amine is coupled to the electron-transfer step. ",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Quasi-SMILES is a sequence of symbols, which represents all available eclectic data, i.e. not only molecular structure, but also different conditions, which can have influence on examined endpoint (e.g. kinds of cells: human breast; human colon; human liver; human lung). In this work, quasi-SMILES have been used to establish predictive models for anticancer activity isoquinoline quinones related to different cells. Descriptor calculated with optimal correlation weights of different fragments of quasi-SMILES defined by the Monte Carlo technique is used to predict pIC50 as a mathematical function of molecular structure and kinds of cells. The using of the so-called index of ideality of correlation for optimization by the Monte Carlo method improves predictive potential of the model. The statistical quality of the models based on correlation weights of fragments of quasi-SMILES is good. The range of correlation coefficient between experimental and calculated pIC50 for external validation set is 0.76-0.89. The statistical stable promoters for increase and for decrease in pIC50 are established. These models can be used to improve quality of pharmaceutical agents. These computational experiments can be reproduced with available on the Internet software ( http://www.insilico.eu/coral ).",

The dramatic increase in viscosity in highly concentrated solutions is a long-standing unsolved problem in physical chemistry. Here we will show that this viscosity increase can be understood in terms of the solute-induced structuring of the first solvation shell, leading to a jamming transition at a critical concentration. As the jamming transition is approached, the viscosity naturally increases according to a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann type expression.

To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts.

An exercise was done at Merck where 386 chemists voted on the molecular complexity (on a scale of 1-5) of 2681 molecules taken from various sources: public, licensed, and in-house. The meanComplexity of a molecule is the average over all votes for that molecule. As long as enough votes are cast per molecule, we find meanComplexity is quite easy to model with QSAR methods using only a handful of physical descriptors (e.g., number of chiral centers, number of unique topological torsions, a Wiener index, etc.). The high level of self-consistency of the model (cross-validated R(2) ∼0.88) is remarkable given that our chemists do not agree with each other strongly about the complexity of any given molecule. Thus, the power of crowdsourcing is clearly demonstrated in this case. The meanComplexity appears to be correlated with at least one metric of synthetic complexity from the literature derived in a different way and is correlated with values of process mass intensity (PMI) from the literature and from in-house studies. Complexity can be used to differentiate between in-house programs and to follow a program over time. ",

People were present in over 70% of the newspapers advertisements, and almost 80% of them were smiling, relating the product or service with positive context more often than with neutral or negative context (p&lt;0.001). The advertisements with smile targeted the adults more frequently (70.6%) and adolescents (33.6%), and less often the elderly (22.2%) and children (4.2%); women (45.9%) or both genders (29.2%) were targeted more often than solely men (2.6%). Smile mostly filled out one quarter of the size of the entire advertisement (97%), equally spontaneous and posed smiles were used. In 82% of cases teeth were visible during smile, and buccal corridors were present in 39% of them. Smile is often used in newspaper advertisements, mostly targeting adult women, and providing the context of positive emotions. Most people will show teeth when they smile. Parameters of micro smile esthetics are not in the focus of an advertisement.",

Here, we derive a solvation model with no empirical parameters for the dielectric response by taking the linear response limit of a classical density functional for molecular liquids. This model directly incorporates the nonlocal dielectric response of the liquid using an angular momentum expansion, and with a single fit parameter for dispersion contributions it predicts solvation energies of neutral molecules with a RMS error of 1.3 kcal/mol in water and 0.8 kcal/mol in chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. We show that this model is more accurate for strongly polar and charged systems than previous solvation models because of the parameter-free electric response, and demonstrate its suitability for ab initio solvation, including self-consistent solvation in quantum Monte Carlo calculations.

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

In the present work, vibration spectroscopy, calorimetric measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Raman and infrared spectra suggest that SA exists predominately as dimers in chloroform, but in the other five solvents there is no clear evidence of dimerization. In all solvents, the shift in the SA carbonyl peak reflecting the strength in the solvent-solute interaction is quite well correlated to the nucleation ranking. This shift is corroborated by DFT calculated energies of binding one solvent molecule to the carboxyl group of SA. An even better correlation of the influence of the solvent on the nucleation is provided by DFT calculated energy of binding the complete first solvation shell to the SA molecule. These solvation shell binding energies are corroborated by the enthalpy of solvent-solute interaction as estimated from experimentally determined enthalpy of solution and calculated enthalpy of cavity formation using the scaled particle theory. The different methods reveal a consistent picture and suggest that the stronger the solvent binds to the SA molecule in solution, the slower the nucleation becomes. ",

The solubility behavior of acetylene in RTILs was examined using a linear solvation energy relationship based on Kamlet-Taft solvent parameters including the hydrogen-bond acidity or donor ability (α), the hydrogen-bond basicity or acceptor ability (β), and the polarity/polarizability (π*). It is found that the solubility of acetylene linearly correlates with β value and is almost independent of α or π*. The solubility of acetylene in RTILs increases with increasing hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) ability of the anion, but is little affected by the nature of the cation. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate that the acidic proton of acetylene specifically forms hydrogen bond with a basic oxygen atom on the anion of a RTIL. On the other hand, although C-H···π interaction is plausible, all optimized structures indicate that the acidic protons on the cation do not specifically associate with the π cloud of acetylene. Thermodynamic analysis agrees well with the proposed correlation: the higher the β value of a RTIL is, the more negative the enthalpy of acetylene absorption in the RTIL is.",

In general, significant organoleptic differences are perceived between these enantiomers. Chiral 2-substituted-3(2H)-furanones, featuring a unique keto-enol tautomer, the cause of their racemization, have been known to play an important role in flavor because of their extremely low threshold values and their burnt sugar odor characteristics. Since the discovery of these important aroma chemicals, they have been used in large quantities as raw materials in the flavor and fragrance industry. However, absolute configurations of these furanone derivatives have remained ambiguous for the past 40 years. Here optical resolutions of 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone, 2,5-dimethyl-4-methoxy-3(2H)-furanone, and 4-acetoxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone were accomplished using chiral CO(2) supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Their absolute configurations were unraveled for the first time using the vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) technique as well as by chemical relay reactions. Odor evaluation of each enantiomer revealed relationships between their configurations and odor activities.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Unfortunately, organic solvents make up most of the organic waste created by the chemical enterprise, whether from academic, industrial, or governmental labs. One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water.

It is also worth noting that a variety of different reactions may be performed at the same time.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments.

Within this Review, a great variety of examples showing how cyclopentyl methyl ether has been established as particularly useful for this purpose are reported. Indeed, its low toxicity, high boiling point, low melting point, hydrophobicity, chemical stability towards a wide range of conditions, exceptional stability towards the abstraction of hydrogen atoms, relatively low latent heat of vaporization, and the ease with which it can be recovered and recycled enable its successful employment as a solvent in a wide range of synthetic applications, including organometallic chemistry, catalysis, biphasic reactions, oxidations, and radical reactions.",

The reactivity of Ox(-) and p-ClPhO(-) increases significantly as the DMSO content in the medium increases, although the effects of medium on reactivity are not the same for the reactions with Ox(-) and p-ClPhO(-). Ox(-) exhibits the α-effect in all solvent compositions and temperatures. The α-effect increases up to 50 mol % DMSO and then decreases thereafter, resulting in a bell-shaped α-effect profile. Dissection of the activation parameters (i.e., ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡)) has revealed that the bell-shaped α-effect behavior is due to entropy of activation differences rather than enthalpy terms, although the enthalpy term controls almost entirely the solvent dependence of the reaction rate. Differences in the transition-state (TS) structures for the reactions with Ox(-) (a six-membered cyclic TS) and p-ClPhO(-) (an acyclic TS) are consistent with the entropy-dependent α-effect behavior.",

Although such terms are precisely defined, their use often engenders confusion and ambiguity. Perhaps, the most improper use of chirality, yet widely accepted, is related to its association with stereodynamics and physico-chemical transformations, such as chiral discrimination, chiral resolution, chiral recognition, chiral synthesis, and so on. Even though this conceptual perversion has been highlighted by renowned stereochemists, it has become a recurring keyword and a hot message in modern literature. It is timely to renew the correct use and context in forums such as the present journal, adding further reflections that may help both beginners and practitioners.

The reactivity of Ox(-) and p-ClPhO(-) increases significantly as the DMSO content in the medium increases, although the effects of medium on reactivity are not the same for the reactions with Ox(-) and p-ClPhO(-). Ox(-) exhibits the α-effect in all solvent compositions and temperatures. The α-effect increases up to 50 mol % DMSO and then decreases thereafter, resulting in a bell-shaped α-effect profile. Dissection of the activation parameters (i.e., ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡)) has revealed that the bell-shaped α-effect behavior is due to entropy of activation differences rather than enthalpy terms, although the enthalpy term controls almost entirely the solvent dependence of the reaction rate. Differences in the transition-state (TS) structures for the reactions with Ox(-) (a six-membered cyclic TS) and p-ClPhO(-) (an acyclic TS) are consistent with the entropy-dependent α-effect behavior.",

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality.

A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

The ionic mechanism is the one found in most organic chemistry textbooks; it begins with the protonation of the ketone by the acid catalyst, even though this reaction normally takes place in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane. Our calculations show that the concerted non-ionic pathway, which is the least energetic in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane, becomes more energetic the more polar the solvent. After investigating a variety of non-ionic and ionic pathways in water, it is found that the addition step seems to be ionic but the migration step, which is rate-determining, is uncatalyzed, non-ionic and fully concerted. These results confirm the experimental findings in solvents of low to medium polarity that the rate constant of the reaction decreases as the solvent polarity increases.

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water.

Whereas the solvent is responsible for the tautomerisation equilibrium position, the catalyst only serves to eliminate kinetic control from the reaction. Generally, to preserve reaction efficiency and improve sustainability, bio-derivable p-cymene was found to be a useful solvent.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

This idea has resulted from the concept that most molecular solvents are homogeneous. In a deep eutectic solvent (DES), however, both components can be ionic or non-ionic, polar or non-polar. By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity. Accordingly, the areas covered in this special issue focus on structure and dynamics, solvation, the mobility of charged species, and the ability to obtain controllable phase behavior by adding polar diluents or using hydrophobic DESs.",

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome. Overall, this work quantitatively extends the understanding of solvent effects in ionic liquids and demonstrates the potential for such information to be used to rationally select an ionic liquid to control reaction outcome.",

Melting and boiling points as characteristic values emerge from this study as products of laboratory standardization, developed by chemists in their struggle to classify, understand and control organic nature. A major argument here concerns the role played by the introduction of organic synthesis in driving these changes. Synthetic organic chemistry vastly increased the number of known organic substances, precipitating the chemical identity crisis of my title. Successful natural product synthesis, moreover, depended on chemists' ability to demonstrate the absolute identity of synthetic product and natural target--something late nineteenth-century chemists eventually achieved by making reliable, replicable melting and boiling point measurements. In the period before the establishment of national standards laboratories, chemists and scientific glassblowers worked together to standardize melting and boiling points as physical constants, such collaborations highlighting the essential importance of chemical glassware and glassblowing skill in the development of nineteenth-century organic chemistry.",

A set of ten different organic reactions were evaluated, including the Knoevenagel, Hantzsch, Biginelli and Meldrum reactions. It is important to highlight the use of a commercial device that produces infrared irradiation in the near infrared region and its distribution by convection providing heating uniformity, significantly reducing reaction times, achieving good yields and proceeding in the absence of solvent. It is also worth noting that a variety of different reactions may be performed at the same time.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

In the present paper, we analyze a series of SN2 reactions in three solvents that lead to endothermic and exothermic reaction processes, and we show that within the hybridization reaction coordinate the SN2 reaction is fully consistent with both treatments. We give new presentations of the reaction energies as a function of reaction progress, which allow the generation of unified reaction coordinate diagrams that show a linear relationship between the hybridization metric of reaction progress and the relative energies of the stationary points on the potential surface as a function of structure and solvent as originally envisaged by Leffler and Hammond.",

DESs are prepared by the simple mixing of two or three cheap constituents (that are capable of self-association) with gentle heating, which leads to a drastic decrease in their melting points. The resultant clear homogeneous mixture consists of cations, anions, as well as neutral molecules; this will contribute both ionic and molecular solvent properties to the DESs. DESs have emerged as alternatives to conventional organic solvents and ILs, which meet different criteria such as availability, low cost, low toxicity, biodegradability, recyclability, ease of preparation method, tunable, and designer physiochemical properties. Many of them have attracted considerable attention and haave been applied in distinct fields of chemistry. To summarize the full-scale development of DESs, this review discusses the history, classifications, various methods of preparation, properties, and some major applications in catalysis in the last three years. This review is expected to be helpful for the further development of DESs based on a summary of the fundamental research in the field.",

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

While other models for liquid phases, as for example UNIFAC, are in general more accurate than COSMO-SAC, these models typically contain many adjustable parameters and can be limited in their applicability. In contrast, the COSMO-SAC model only contains a few universal parameters and subdivides the molecular surface area into charged segments that interact with each other. In recent years, additional improvements to the construction of the sigma profiles and evaluation of activity coefficients have been made. In this work, we present a comprehensive description of how to postprocess the results of a COSMO calculation through to the evaluation of thermodynamic properties. We also assembled a large database of COSMO files, consisting of 2261 compounds, freely available to academic and noncommercial users. We especially focus on the documentation of the implementation and provide the optimized source code in C++, wrappers in Python, and sample sigma profiles calculated from each approach, as well as tests and validation results. The misunderstandings in the literature relating to COSMO-SAC are described and corrected. The computational efficiency of the implementation is demonstrated.",

New evidence and opinion.\nThe effects of two polar co-solvents, chlorodifluoromethane and acetone, on the solubility and enthalpy of a solution of 1,4-naphthoquinone in supercritical (SC) CO2 were studied. We found that the dissolution process becomes less exothermic in the presence of the co-solvents relative to that in pure CO2, although the solubility is enhanced significantly by the co-solvents. This indicates that the increase in the solubility by adding co-solvents results from the increase of the entropy of solution. On the basis of the unexpected results we propose a new mechanism for the solubility enhancement of the solute by the co-solvents in supercritical fluids (SCF); this should be applicable to cases in which the local density of the SC solvent around the solute and the co-solvent is larger, and the co-solvent associates preferentially with the solute. The results are also very important for the understanding of other fundamental questions of SCF science, such as the effect of co-solvents on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the reactions in SCFs.",

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome.

In particular, the existing controversy about the character of the key proton transfer in the MBH reaction (Aggarwal versus McQuade pathways) has been resolved.

Using well-described electrofuges, solvolysis rate constants were determined in mixtures containing different proportions of ethanol and the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide; the different solvent effects observed as the mixture changed could be explained using interactions of the ionic liquid with species along the reaction coordinate, determined using temperature dependent kinetic studies. The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome. Overall, this work quantitatively extends the understanding of solvent effects in ionic liquids and demonstrates the potential for such information to be used to rationally select an ionic liquid to control reaction outcome.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium.

In this work, the reaction kinetics was studied for the esterifications of acetic acid and propionic acid with ethanol at 303.15 K. It was found that the reactant ratio as well as the applied solvents (acetonitrile, tetrahydrofurane, dimethylformamide) significantly affect the reaction rate. The thermodynamic model PC-SAFT was applied to account for the interactions between the reacting species and the solvents via activity coefficients. This allowed the identification of solvent-independent kinetic constants and the prediction of the solvent effect on reaction kinetics in almost quantitative agreement with experimental data. The presented approach shows the importance of taking into account thermodynamic non-idealities and significantly reduces experimental effort for finding the best solvent candidate for a given target reaction.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Intensive investigations into the role of solvents on diastereo- and enantioselective reactions, as well as temperature-dependent measurements of diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratios, have shed light on the existence of dynamic solvation effects. In this tutorial review, several examples of non-linear Eyring plots in stereoselective nucleophilic additions, cycloadditions, photochemical and enzymatic reactions are reported. Experimental data and spectroscopic analyses obtained in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, halohydrocarbons, ethers and mixtures lead to the formulation of a hypothesis on the inversion temperature phenomenon as being due to an equilibrium between distinct solute-solvent clusters, which are the real reactive species in solution.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

This study focuses on the preparation of CA from ASI. Five hydrolysis methods were compared including H2SO4 hydrolysis, HCl hydrolysis, two-phase acid hydrolysis, mild acid hydrolysis, and Smith degradation. Seven hydrolysis products were purified, and five of them were identified as new compounds. The results indicated that Smith degradation was the most effective approach to prepare CA. In contrast, mild acid hydrolysis produced CA at a low yield, accompanied with the artificial sapogenin astragenol. The other three acid hydrolysis methods mainly produced astragenol. Furthermore, the reaction conditions for Smith degradation were optimized as follows: ASI was dissolved in 60% MeOH-H2O solution, oxidized with 5 equiv. NaIO4 for 12h, followed by reduction with 3 equiv. NaBH4 for 4h, and finally acidified with 1M H2SO4 at pH2 for 24h. Under the optimal conditions, CA could be prepared from ASI at a yield of 84.4%.

A third Guareschi reaction, the so-called \"Guareschi 1897 reaction\", is one of the most unusual reactions in organic chemistry, involving the radical-mediated paradoxical aerobic generation of hydrocarbons in near-neutral water solution. A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

In all cases, the water content versus rate profile shows a maximum at around 0.2 M H2 O. The rate versus amine content profile shows in all cases, except for benzyl chloride, saturation behavior, which is typical of a change in the identity of the rate-determining step. The mechanism that is in agreement with the observed data is that electron transfer occurs in the first step. With substrates that are not very electrophilic, the intermediate radical anions lose the added electron back to samarium(III) relatively quickly and the reaction cannot progress efficiently. However, in a mixture of water/amine, the amine deprotonates a molecule of water coordinated to samarium(III). The negatively charged hydroxide, which is coordinated to samarium(III), reduces its electrophilicity, and therefore, lowers the rate of back electron transfer, which allows the reaction to progress. In the case of benzyl chloride, in which electron transfer is rate determining, deprotonation by the amine is coupled to the electron-transfer step. ",

What's <i>your</i> E Factor?\nTraditional organic chemistry, and organic synthesis in particular, relies heavily on organic solvents, as most reactions involve organic substrates and catalysts that tend to be water-insoluble. Unfortunately, organic solvents make up most of the organic waste created by the chemical enterprise, whether from academic, industrial, or governmental labs. One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water. The resulting micellar arrays serve as nanoreactors, obviating organic solvents as the reaction medium, while maximizing environmental benefits.",

One of the most attractive challenges is finding, creating and developing new and green media. Over the last decades, the scientific community has mainly focused on two different classes of solvents (namely, Ionic liquids and Eutectic Solvents). These solvents share advantageous characteristics (low vapor pressure, thermally stable, non-flammable, etc …) making them an attractive option to implement sustainable chemistry and engineering. Mainly due to its environmental and economic features, DES are now growing much more interest. Indeed, although their ecotoxicological profile is still poorly known, DES are classified as \"green\" solvents because they are composed of molecules which are considered to be eco-friendly.

New evidence and opinion.\nThe effects of two polar co-solvents, chlorodifluoromethane and acetone, on the solubility and enthalpy of a solution of 1,4-naphthoquinone in supercritical (SC) CO2 were studied. We found that the dissolution process becomes less exothermic in the presence of the co-solvents relative to that in pure CO2, although the solubility is enhanced significantly by the co-solvents. This indicates that the increase in the solubility by adding co-solvents results from the increase of the entropy of solution. On the basis of the unexpected results we propose a new mechanism for the solubility enhancement of the solute by the co-solvents in supercritical fluids (SCF); this should be applicable to cases in which the local density of the SC solvent around the solute and the co-solvent is larger, and the co-solvent associates preferentially with the solute. The results are also very important for the understanding of other fundamental questions of SCF science, such as the effect of co-solvents on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the reactions in SCFs.",

The density of the mixed solvents at different pressures was also determined and the isothermal compressibility was calculated using the density data. The activation volume of the reaction was calculated based on the dependence of rate constant (kc) on pressure. It was demonstrated that the kc was very sensitive to the pressure in the mixed solvents near the critical region and the kc increased dramatically as pressure approached dew points, critical point, and bubble points of the mixed solvents. However, the kc in the mixed solvents outside the critical region or in pure CO2 was not sensitive to pressure. At suitable conditions, kc could be 40 times larger than that in acetonitrile. The activation volume of the reaction was nearly independent of pressure as the pressure was much higher than the phase separation pressure of the mixed solvents, while it increased considerably as pressure approached the bubble points, critical point, and dew points from high pressure. The clustering of the solvent molecules with the reactants and the activated complex in the reaction systems near the phase boundary in the critical region may be the main reason for the interesting phenomena observed. This work also shows that, using pure CO2 as the solvent, the reaction cannot be carried out in the critical region of the solvent due to the limitations of the reactants, while it can be conducted in the critical region of mixed solvents of suitable compositions, where the solvents are highly compressible and the reaction rate can be tuned effectively by pressure.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers. The outcomes of these condensation reactions are rationalized with the different diamine structures and the relative orientation of cavitands in 1, 4, 5, and 9-14.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

Melting and boiling points as characteristic values emerge from this study as products of laboratory standardization, developed by chemists in their struggle to classify, understand and control organic nature. A major argument here concerns the role played by the introduction of organic synthesis in driving these changes. Synthetic organic chemistry vastly increased the number of known organic substances, precipitating the chemical identity crisis of my title. Successful natural product synthesis, moreover, depended on chemists' ability to demonstrate the absolute identity of synthetic product and natural target--something late nineteenth-century chemists eventually achieved by making reliable, replicable melting and boiling point measurements. In the period before the establishment of national standards laboratories, chemists and scientific glassblowers worked together to standardize melting and boiling points as physical constants, such collaborations highlighting the essential importance of chemical glassware and glassblowing skill in the development of nineteenth-century organic chemistry.",

The models indicated that steric factors do not contribute significantly, because of bias in the experimental database. The most important descriptors are solvent-dependent HOMO energy and Hirshfeld charge of the nucleophilic atom.

This approach provides an a priori classification without requiring the knowledge of any experimental data. The theoretical descriptors of the proposed classification are generated through the analysis of the COSMO-RS σ-potential profiles. By applying a two-step statistical procedure to the descriptors generated for a set of 153 representative solvents, a clustering into 10 classes leads to an optimal classification that is compared to the classical Chastrette's classification. The investigation of nitrocellulose solubility allows a validation of the proposed classification, which can be extended also to solvent mixtures. This new approach for solvent classification, thus, appears as a consistent tool for the design of new solvents and their formulation.",

QSPR models for each scale were constructed using only theoretical descriptors. The high quality of the models is reflected by the squared multiple correlation coefficients that range from 0.726 to 0.999; only 18 models have R2&lt; 0.800. This enables direct theoretical calculation of predicted values for any scale and/or for any organic solvent, including those previously unmeasured. The molecular descriptors involved in the models are classified and discussed according to (i) the origin of their calculation (i.e., constitutional, geometric, charge-related, etc.) and (ii) the commonly accepted classification of physical interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in liquid (condensed) media. A reduced matrix 774 (solvents) x 100 (solvent scales) was selected for the principal component analysis (PCA) by taking into account only the solvent scales with more than 20 experimental data points. The first 5 principal components account for 75% of the total variance. The robustness of the PCA model obtained was validated by the comparison models development for restricted submatrices of data and with the results obtained for the full data set. The total variance accounted for by the first three PCs, for the submatrices with the same number of solvent scales but different numbers of solvents, varies from 68.2% to 59.0%. This demonstrates that the total variance described by the first 3 components is essentially stable as the number of solvents involved varies from 100 to 774. Subsequently, a matrix with 703 diverse solvents and 100 solvent scales was selected for the general classification of the solvents and scales according to the scores and loadings obtained from the PCA treatment. Classification of the theoretical molecular descriptors, derived from the chemical structure alone, according to their relevance to specific types of intermolecular interaction (cavity formation, electrostatic polarization, dispersion, and hydrogen bonding) in liquid media enables a more easily comprehensible physical interpretation of the QSPR of molecular properties in liquids and solutions. The reported QSPR models for solvent scales with theoretical molecular descriptors and the results of the PCA analysis are potentially of great practical importance, as they extend the applicability of correlations with empirical solvent scales to many previously unmeasured systems.",

By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior.

New evidence and opinion.\nThe effects of two polar co-solvents, chlorodifluoromethane and acetone, on the solubility and enthalpy of a solution of 1,4-naphthoquinone in supercritical (SC) CO2 were studied. We found that the dissolution process becomes less exothermic in the presence of the co-solvents relative to that in pure CO2, although the solubility is enhanced significantly by the co-solvents. This indicates that the increase in the solubility by adding co-solvents results from the increase of the entropy of solution. On the basis of the unexpected results we propose a new mechanism for the solubility enhancement of the solute by the co-solvents in supercritical fluids (SCF); this should be applicable to cases in which the local density of the SC solvent around the solute and the co-solvent is larger, and the co-solvent associates preferentially with the solute. The results are also very important for the understanding of other fundamental questions of SCF science, such as the effect of co-solvents on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the reactions in SCFs.",

The model incorporates two solvent dependent and two specific solute-solvent parameters represented by a set of electronic indexes derived from the conceptual density functional theory. The specific solute-solvent interactions are described in terms of the electronic chemical potential for proton migration between the anion or cation and the transition state structure of a specific reaction. These indexes provide a quantitative estimation of the hydrogen bond (HB) acceptor basicity and the hydrogen bond donor acidity of the ionic solvent, respectively. A sound quantitative scale of HB strength is thereby obtained. The solvent dependent contributions are described by the global electrophilicity of the cation and nucleophilicity of the anion forming the ionic liquid. The model is illustrated for the kinetics of cycloaddition of cyclopentadiene towards acrolein. In general, cation HB acidity outweighs the remaining parameters for this reaction.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

In this work, reactions are labeled with experimental conditions, and network analysis shows that consistencies within clusters of data points can be leveraged to organize this information. In particular, this analysis shows how particular experimental conditions (specifically solvent) are effective in enabling specific organic reactions (Friedel-Crafts, Aldol addition, Claisen condensation, Diels-Alder, and Wittig), including variations within each reaction class. Network analysis shows data points for reactions tend to break into clusters that depend on the catalyst and chemical structure. This type of clustering, which mimics how a chemist reasons, is derived directly from the network. Therefore, the findings of this work could augment synthesis planning by providing predictions in a fashion that mimics human chemists. To numerically evaluate solvent prediction ability, three methods are compared: network analysis (through the <ik</i-nearest neighbor algorithm), a support vector machine, and a deep neural network. The most accurate method in 4 of the 5 test cases is the network analysis, with deep neural networks also showing good prediction scores.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide-ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.",

The results showed that HOCl reacted with anisole in acidic solution, with the hydrogen ion as an important catalyst. Quantification of product distribution of the produced chloroanisoles demonstrated that a chlorine attack in the para-position was favored over the ortho-position. A kinetic model was formulated, which permitted investigation of the relative importance of the chlorine dose and other water quality parameters including the concentrations of anisole and several metal ions, as well as temperature, on the product distribution of chloroanisoles. In general, high chlorine doses led to low concentrations of intermediates. The presence of ions such as Fe(3+) and Al(3+) facilitated the formation of chloroanisoles, but Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) did not.

The amount of chemical to be added to a solvent depends on the final concentration or molarity (M) needed for the finished solution and the total amount in liters (L) of solution required. However, some chemicals come with water molecules attached. The molecular weight (MW) of such compounds, listed as formula weight (FW) on the bottle, includes the mass of the water. Whenever you would use the MW of an unhydrated compound in calculations, use instead the MW of the hydrated compound. If a recipe tells how many grams to use of the unhydrated compound, determine the target concentration and then calculate the grams to use of hydrated compound. When using a hydrated compound, the attached water molecules contribute water to the solution, potentially diluting the final concentration (if the solvent is water). Therefore, you must account for the contribution of water from the hydrated compound when determining the volume of solvent (water) to add. This article describes the calculations involved in making solutions from hydrated compounds.",

In all cases, the water content versus rate profile shows a maximum at around 0.2 M H2 O. The rate versus amine content profile shows in all cases, except for benzyl chloride, saturation behavior, which is typical of a change in the identity of the rate-determining step. The mechanism that is in agreement with the observed data is that electron transfer occurs in the first step. With substrates that are not very electrophilic, the intermediate radical anions lose the added electron back to samarium(III) relatively quickly and the reaction cannot progress efficiently. However, in a mixture of water/amine, the amine deprotonates a molecule of water coordinated to samarium(III). The negatively charged hydroxide, which is coordinated to samarium(III), reduces its electrophilicity, and therefore, lowers the rate of back electron transfer, which allows the reaction to progress. In the case of benzyl chloride, in which electron transfer is rate determining, deprotonation by the amine is coupled to the electron-transfer step. ",

Melting and boiling points as characteristic values emerge from this study as products of laboratory standardization, developed by chemists in their struggle to classify, understand and control organic nature. A major argument here concerns the role played by the introduction of organic synthesis in driving these changes. Synthetic organic chemistry vastly increased the number of known organic substances, precipitating the chemical identity crisis of my title. Successful natural product synthesis, moreover, depended on chemists' ability to demonstrate the absolute identity of synthetic product and natural target--something late nineteenth-century chemists eventually achieved by making reliable, replicable melting and boiling point measurements. In the period before the establishment of national standards laboratories, chemists and scientific glassblowers worked together to standardize melting and boiling points as physical constants, such collaborations highlighting the essential importance of chemical glassware and glassblowing skill in the development of nineteenth-century organic chemistry.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

According to this concept, the conventional organic solvent medium used in catalytic chemical reactions is replaced substantially (up to 80 vol %) by CO(2), at moderate pressures (tens of bars), to create a continuum of CO(2)-expanded solvent media. A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

The density of the mixed solvents at different pressures was also determined and the isothermal compressibility was calculated using the density data. The activation volume of the reaction was calculated based on the dependence of rate constant (kc) on pressure. It was demonstrated that the kc was very sensitive to the pressure in the mixed solvents near the critical region and the kc increased dramatically as pressure approached dew points, critical point, and bubble points of the mixed solvents. However, the kc in the mixed solvents outside the critical region or in pure CO2 was not sensitive to pressure. At suitable conditions, kc could be 40 times larger than that in acetonitrile. The activation volume of the reaction was nearly independent of pressure as the pressure was much higher than the phase separation pressure of the mixed solvents, while it increased considerably as pressure approached the bubble points, critical point, and dew points from high pressure. The clustering of the solvent molecules with the reactants and the activated complex in the reaction systems near the phase boundary in the critical region may be the main reason for the interesting phenomena observed. This work also shows that, using pure CO2 as the solvent, the reaction cannot be carried out in the critical region of the solvent due to the limitations of the reactants, while it can be conducted in the critical region of mixed solvents of suitable compositions, where the solvents are highly compressible and the reaction rate can be tuned effectively by pressure.",

Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude.

In 1908, Callendar showed that water hydrated to the solute can explain some of the departures from Raoult's law in aqueous solution. Here, we show that by simply assuming equilibria between the free water in solution and its hydrated forms, Raoult's law and Callendar's extension are valid over the full range of concentrations, while also showing how water and solutes interact in solution.

The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

In this work, the reaction kinetics was studied for the esterifications of acetic acid and propionic acid with ethanol at 303.15 K. It was found that the reactant ratio as well as the applied solvents (acetonitrile, tetrahydrofurane, dimethylformamide) significantly affect the reaction rate. The thermodynamic model PC-SAFT was applied to account for the interactions between the reacting species and the solvents via activity coefficients. This allowed the identification of solvent-independent kinetic constants and the prediction of the solvent effect on reaction kinetics in almost quantitative agreement with experimental data.

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome. Overall, this work quantitatively extends the understanding of solvent effects in ionic liquids and demonstrates the potential for such information to be used to rationally select an ionic liquid to control reaction outcome.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Increasing solvent polarity in the series of binary mixtures increases the solvolysis rates for the same factor for all benzhydryl derivatives in which the solvation of the leaving group moiety in the transition state is substantial, i.e., log k vs. E(f) correlation lines are parallel (same s(f)). For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers. Inversion in relative abilities of leaving groups is possible if they have similar reactivities and are characterized with different reaction constants.",

The ionic mechanism is the one found in most organic chemistry textbooks; it begins with the protonation of the ketone by the acid catalyst, even though this reaction normally takes place in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane. Our calculations show that the concerted non-ionic pathway, which is the least energetic in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane, becomes more energetic the more polar the solvent. After investigating a variety of non-ionic and ionic pathways in water, it is found that the addition step seems to be ionic but the migration step, which is rate-determining, is uncatalyzed, non-ionic and fully concerted. These results confirm the experimental findings in solvents of low to medium polarity that the rate constant of the reaction decreases as the solvent polarity increases. Moreover, we find that contrary to what is commonly accepted, in the addition and migration ionic steps the deprotonation of the ionic species occurs in a concerted manner with the other chemical events taking place.",

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

Dissection of the activation parameters (i.e., ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡)) has revealed that the bell-shaped α-effect behavior is due to entropy of activation differences rather than enthalpy terms, although the enthalpy term controls almost entirely the solvent dependence of the reaction rate.

Four different pathways (one SN1, one backside and two frontside attacks for SN2) as well as the formation of different ion pairs (tripod, seesaw, and linear) are discussed to investigate the origin of the kinetic solvent effect (KSE) and the contribution of ion pairs to the overall reaction.

The formation of ion pairs does not change the order of the rate law, but it strongly influences the KSE, which can distinguish between reactions starting from free ions and those starting from ion pairs, in contrast to standard kinetic analysis.

Very high stereoselectivity in CH3CN vs low stereoselectivity in CH2Cl2.\nThe MgBr2.OEt2-mediated intramolecular allylation of a 4:1 diastereoisomeric mixture of the alpha-chloroacetoxyl ether 1a bearing the A-G/JK ring system of brevetoxin B in CH2Cl2 gave a 1:1 diastereoisomeric mixture of the trans- and cis-cyclization products 4a and 5a having the A-G/I-K ring system, while that in CH3CN afforded the trans-isomer 4a nearly as the single product. To help clarify a reason for this marked solvent effect in the cyclization of the brevetoxin B precursor, DFT computations for the starting materials, intermediates, transition states, and products were carried out. The cyclization would proceed through a carbocation intermediate 3a having sp2 flat structure (SN1 type mechanism) in CH2Cl2, in which the activation energies leading to both diastereoisomers are approximately identical, while in CH3CN alkylnitrilium salts 6a would be formed through the coordination of CH3CN to the carbocation leading to an sp3-type intermediate in which sever steric hindrance takes place in the transition state leading to the undesired diastereoisomer. The scope of this novel solvent-controlled stereoselectivity was tested for simple compounds. In small model compounds the marked solvent dependence was absent, but the model bearing two consecutive cyclic ether rings 1b exhibited a remarkable solvent effect similar to that observed in the brevetoxin B system.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

When these two conformations have equal populations, as in CHCl(3) solvent, the net rotation is close to zero.

We demonstrate the method's usefulness and performance on p<iK</i <suba</sub conversions involving water and organic solvents acetonitrile (MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide (Me<sub2</subSO), and methanol (MeOH). We focus on the p<iK</i <suba</sub conversion from the known reference value in water to the other three organic solvents, although such a conversion can also be performed between any pair of the considered solvents. The ECM works with an additive parameter that is specific to a solvent and a molecular family (essentially characterized by a functional group that is titrated). We formally show that the method can be formulated with a single additive parameter, and that the extra multiplicative parameter used in other works is not required. The values of the additive parameter are determined from known p<iK</i <suba</sub data, and their interpretation is provided on the basis of physicochemical concepts. The data set of known p<iK</i <suba</sub values is augmented with p<iK</i <suba</sub values computed with the recently introduced electrostatic transform method, whose validity is demonstrated. For a validation of our method, we consider p<iK</i <suba</sub conversions for two data sets of titratable compounds. The first data set involves 81 relatively small molecules belonging to 19 different molecular families, with the p<iK</i <suba</sub data available in all four considered solvents. The second data set involves 76 titratable molecules from 5 additional molecular families. These molecules are typically larger, and their experimental p<iK</i <suba</sub values are available only in Me<sub2</subSO and water. The validation tests show that the agreement between the experimental p<iK</i <suba</sub data and the ECM predictions is generally good, with absolute errors often on the order of 0.5 pH units.

The solubility behavior of acetylene in RTILs was examined using a linear solvation energy relationship based on Kamlet-Taft solvent parameters including the hydrogen-bond acidity or donor ability (α), the hydrogen-bond basicity or acceptor ability (β), and the polarity/polarizability (π*). It is found that the solubility of acetylene linearly correlates with β value and is almost independent of α or π*. The solubility of acetylene in RTILs increases with increasing hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) ability of the anion, but is little affected by the nature of the cation. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate that the acidic proton of acetylene specifically forms hydrogen bond with a basic oxygen atom on the anion of a RTIL. On the other hand, although C-H···π interaction is plausible, all optimized structures indicate that the acidic protons on the cation do not specifically associate with the π cloud of acetylene. Thermodynamic analysis agrees well with the proposed correlation: the higher the β value of a RTIL is, the more negative the enthalpy of acetylene absorption in the RTIL is.",

By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity.

                    "contents": "Volcano Plots Emerge from a Sea of Nonaqueous Solvents: The Law of Matching Water Affinities Extends to All Solvents.\nThe properties of all electrolyte solutions, whether the solvent is aqueous or nonaqueous, are strongly dependent on the nature of the ions in solution. The consequences of these specific-ion effects are significant and manifest from biochemistry to battery technology. The \"law of matching water affinities\" (LMWA) has proven to be a powerful concept for understanding and predicting specific-ion effects in a wide range of systems, including the stability of proteins and colloids, solubility, the behavior of lipids, surfactants, and polyelectrolytes, and catalysis in water and ionic liquids. It provides a framework for considering how the ions of an electrolyte interact in manifestations of ion specificity and therefore represents a considerable conceptual advance on the Hofmeister or lyotropic series in understanding specific-ion effects. Underpinning the development of the law of matching water affinities were efforts to interpret the so-called \"volcano plots\". Volcano plots exhibit a stark inverted \"V\" shape trend for a range of electrolyte dependent solution properties when plotted against the difference in solvation energies of the ions that constitute the electrolyte. Here we test the hypothesis that volcano plots are also manifest in nonaqueous solvents in order to investigate whether the LMWA can be extended to nonaqueous solvents. First we examine the standard solvation energies of electrolytes in nonaqueous solvents for evidence of volcano trends and then extend this to include the solubility and the activity/osmotic coefficients of electrolytes, in order to explore real electrolyte concentrations. We find that with respect to the solvent volcano trends are universal, which brings into question the role of solvent affinity in the manifestation of specific-ion effects. We also show that the volcano trends are maintained when the ionic radii are used in place of the absolute solvation energies as the abscissa, thus showing that ion sizes, rather than the solvent affinities, fundamentally determine the manifestation of ion specificity. This leads us to propose that specific-ion effects across all solvents including water can be understood by considering the relative sizes of the anion and cation, provided the ions are spherical or tetrahedral. This is an extension of the LMWA to all solvents in which the \"water affinity\" is replaced with the relative size of the anion and cation.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

A third Guareschi reaction, the so-called \"Guareschi 1897 reaction\", is one of the most unusual reactions in organic chemistry, involving the radical-mediated paradoxical aerobic generation of hydrocarbons in near-neutral water solution. A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments.

When I think of Tetsuo Nozoe, these are the images that immediately come to mind. When I think of the Nozoe Autograph Books, I also think of time. For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

An investigation into catalytic and solvent effects has returned the conclusion that the diketo-enol tautomerisation equilibrium of the dicarbonyl reactant dictates the yield of the reaction. Whereas the solvent is responsible for the tautomerisation equilibrium position, the catalyst only serves to eliminate kinetic control from the reaction. Generally, to preserve reaction efficiency and improve sustainability, bio-derivable p-cymene was found to be a useful solvent. The metal-enolate intermediate that results from the application of a Lewis acidic catalyst often cited as promoting the reaction appears to hinder the reaction. In this instance, a Brønsted acidic solvent can be used to return greater reactivity to the dicarbonyl reagent.",

Increasing solvent polarity in the series of binary mixtures increases the solvolysis rates for the same factor for all benzhydryl derivatives in which the solvation of the leaving group moiety in the transition state is substantial, i.e., log k vs. E(f) correlation lines are parallel (same s(f)). For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity. Accordingly, the areas covered in this special issue focus on structure and dynamics, solvation, the mobility of charged species, and the ability to obtain controllable phase behavior by adding polar diluents or using hydrophobic DESs.",

The thermodynamic model PC-SAFT was applied to account for the interactions between the reacting species and the solvents via activity coefficients.

Although the overall forward and reverse activation barriers are significantly lowered by the solvent, the Eact,trans are very little affected. Thus the increased rates that are predicted for this process in aqueous solution can be attributed to the solvent facilitating the structural effects in the preparative stages, decreasing the Eact,prep.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Odors and the ways they are perceived, however, are varied and incredibly complex, requiring an understanding of chemistry, neuroscience, aesthetics, and social science.

Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\".

This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Cress extracts were studied by analytical (GC-MS, GC-FPD) and chemical (fractionation) means to identify new interesting odorant compounds. Two compounds that have never been reported in cress extracts, containing both nitrogen and sulfur, were discovered: N-benzyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate and N-phenethyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate.

The physicochemical characteristics of APA-22 HCl were studied at 25 degrees C by using equilibrium surface tension (gamma), solubilization of an oil-soluble dye, steady-state fluorescence, and chloride ion selective electrode techniques. The APA-22 HCl salt is considered to form an aggregate at a concentration, C(1), which is about twice the concentration of the solubility limit of APAs with shorter alkyl chains. At a higher concentration, C(2), the aggregates of APA-22 HCl start forming another kind of aggregate, which is able to solubilize oil-soluble materials. That is, C(1) is considered to represent the critical aggregation concentration (cac) and C(2) a morphology transition. In the concentration region between C(1) and C(2) the solutions are seemingly transparent whereas at above C(2) they appear bluish or translucent. Since the Krafft point of APA-22 HCl is 55 degrees C, all the solutions, including the aggregates, are thought to exist in metastable states.

Crystallization without dye precipitation took place if the reagent, prepared with pararosaniline base or chloride in a saturated SO2 solution, was stored for a sufficient time at room temperature in partly filled flasks. These crystals remained colorless if washed with acid alcohol after being separated by filtration. Schiff reagents layered with paraffin oil or supplemented with 0.1 M hydroquinone took much longer to crystallize, suggesting that crystallization is promoted by the partial oxidation of sulfurous acid to sulfuric acid. A high yield of crystals can be obtained at room temperature after as little as 24 hr by adding 0.04 M of H2SO4 to a Schiff reagent prepared with 2% pararosaniline chloride in a saturated SO2 solution.

Assuming CO2 solutions in the mouth stimulate only trigeminal nerve endings, this result is not altogether surprising; however, there are neurophysiological data indicating that CO2 stimulates gustatory as well as trigeminal fibers. In that case, carbonation might alter the quality profile of a stimulus without producing substantial changes in overall taste intensity--much as occurs when qualitatively different taste stimuli are mixed. To address this possibility, subjects were asked to rate the total taste intensity of moderate concentrations of stimuli representing each of the basic tastes and their binary combinations, with an without added carbonation. They then subdivided total taste intensity into the proportions of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness and 'other taste qualities' they perceived. The addition of carbonation produced only small increases in ratings of total taste intensity. However, rather dramatic alterations in the quality profiles of stimuli were observed, particularly for sweet and salty tastes. The nature of the interaction is consistent with a direct effect of carbonation/CO2 on the gustatory system, although the possibility that at least some of the observed effects reflect trigeminal-gustatory interactions cannot be ruled out.",

In this tutorial review, several examples of non-linear Eyring plots in stereoselective nucleophilic additions, cycloadditions, photochemical and enzymatic reactions are reported. Experimental data and spectroscopic analyses obtained in aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, halohydrocarbons, ethers and mixtures lead to the formulation of a hypothesis on the inversion temperature phenomenon as being due to an equilibrium between distinct solute-solvent clusters, which are the real reactive species in solution.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

Using well-described electrofuges, solvolysis rate constants were determined in mixtures containing different proportions of ethanol and the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide; the different solvent effects observed as the mixture changed could be explained using interactions of the ionic liquid with species along the reaction coordinate, determined using temperature dependent kinetic studies. The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome. Overall, this work quantitatively extends the understanding of solvent effects in ionic liquids and demonstrates the potential for such information to be used to rationally select an ionic liquid to control reaction outcome.",

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures.

The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Indeed, we demonstrate that sufficient information about word tests for easy human recognition is contained in the site marginal probabilities and the site-to-nearby-site covariances and that these quantities can be embedded directly into certain conditional probabilities, designed for effective simulation. The CAPTCHAs are then partial random realizations of the random CAPTCHA word. We start with an initial random field (e.g., randomly scattered letter pieces) and use Gibbs resampling to re-simulate portions of the field repeatedly using these conditional probabilities until the word becomes human-readable. The residual randomness from the initial random field together with the random implementation of the CAPTCHA word provide significant resistance to attack. This results in a CAPTCHA, which is unrecognizable to modern optical character recognition but is recognized about 95% of the time in a human readability study.",

There is no unequivocal method for determining the position of the smile line. A rough distinction can be made between qualitative and (semi)-quantitative methods. The (semi)-quantitative methods have clear advantages for research purposes, but their reliability is unknown. It was demonstrated that among minimally 40% of subjects the maxillary gingiva was not visible when smiling. The mandibular gingiva was not visible when smiling among more than 90% of subjects.

Twenty items of the analysis form the presence of people, smile characteristics, context of smile use, impression of success and health, and targeted audience. The chi-square test was used in statistical analysis. People were present in over 70% of the newspapers advertisements, and almost 80% of them were smiling, relating the product or service with positive context more often than with neutral or negative context (p&lt;0.001). The advertisements with smile targeted the adults more frequently (70.6%) and adolescents (33.6%), and less often the elderly (22.2%) and children (4.2%); women (45.9%) or both genders (29.2%) were targeted more often than solely men (2.6%).

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Specifically, we modeled the facial expressions using a data-driven approach and showed that reward smiles are symmetrical and accompanied by eyebrow raising, affiliative smiles involve lip pressing, and dominance smiles are asymmetrical and contain nose wrinkling and upper-lip raising. A Bayesian-classifier analysis and a detection task revealed that the three smile types are highly distinct. Finally, social judgments made by a separate participant group showed that the different smile types convey different social messages. Our results provide the first detailed description of the physical form and social messages conveyed by these three types of functional smiles and document the versatility of these facial expressions.",

Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database.

Here we reported that when asking the Chinese to judge the Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles as either real or fake, their accuracy and sensitivity were negatively correlated with their individualism scores but positively correlated with their collectivism scores. However, such correlations were found only for participants who stated the eyes to be the most useful references, but not for those who favored the mouth. Moreover, participants who favored the eyes were more accurate and sensitive than those who favored the mouth. Our results thus indicate that Chinese who follow the typical Eastern decoding process of using the eyes as diagnostic cues to identify and interpret others' facial expressions and social intentions, are particularly accurate and sensitive, the more they self-report greater collectivistic and lower individualistic values.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

The physicochemical characteristics of APA-22 HCl were studied at 25 degrees C by using equilibrium surface tension (gamma), solubilization of an oil-soluble dye, steady-state fluorescence, and chloride ion selective electrode techniques. The APA-22 HCl salt is considered to form an aggregate at a concentration, C(1), which is about twice the concentration of the solubility limit of APAs with shorter alkyl chains. At a higher concentration, C(2), the aggregates of APA-22 HCl start forming another kind of aggregate, which is able to solubilize oil-soluble materials. That is, C(1) is considered to represent the critical aggregation concentration (cac) and C(2) a morphology transition. In the concentration region between C(1) and C(2) the solutions are seemingly transparent whereas at above C(2) they appear bluish or translucent. Since the Krafft point of APA-22 HCl is 55 degrees C, all the solutions, including the aggregates, are thought to exist in metastable states. Notably, however, these metastable solutions do not change significantly over a few months. The excellent solubility of APA-22 HCl in water is considered to be a result of this unique stepwise aggregation with increasing concentration.",

Assuming CO2 solutions in the mouth stimulate only trigeminal nerve endings, this result is not altogether surprising; however, there are neurophysiological data indicating that CO2 stimulates gustatory as well as trigeminal fibers. In that case, carbonation might alter the quality profile of a stimulus without producing substantial changes in overall taste intensity--much as occurs when qualitatively different taste stimuli are mixed. To address this possibility, subjects were asked to rate the total taste intensity of moderate concentrations of stimuli representing each of the basic tastes and their binary combinations, with an without added carbonation. They then subdivided total taste intensity into the proportions of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness and 'other taste qualities' they perceived. The addition of carbonation produced only small increases in ratings of total taste intensity. However, rather dramatic alterations in the quality profiles of stimuli were observed, particularly for sweet and salty tastes. The nature of the interaction is consistent with a direct effect of carbonation/CO2 on the gustatory system, although the possibility that at least some of the observed effects reflect trigeminal-gustatory interactions cannot be ruled out.",

Axilla odours aren't simple byproducts of our metabolism but specifically formed by an intricate interplay between i) specific glands, ii) secreted amino acid conjugates of highly specific odorants and iii) selective enzymes present in microorganisms colonizing our skin, providing a natural 'controlled-release' mechanism. Within a multidisciplinary research project, we were able to elucidate the structure of key body odorants, isolate and characterize secreted amino acid conjugates and identify the enzymes responsible for odour release. These enzymes then served as targets for the development of specific active compounds in an almost medicinal chemistry approach, an approach rarely used in the cosmetic field so far. Here we review the key new insights into the biochemistry of human body odour formation, with some remarks on the experimental steps undertaken and hurdles encountered. The development of deodorant actives and the difficult path to market for such specifically acting cosmetic actives is discussed. The basic insights into the biochemistry also opened the way to address some questions in population genetics: Why have large proportions of Asians lost the 'ability' to form body odours? Do twins smell the same? Are our typical body odours indeed influenced by the immune system as often claimed? After addressing these questions, I'll conclude with the key remaining challenges in this field on an ecological niche that is 'anatomically very close to our heart'.",

Axilla odours aren't simple byproducts of our metabolism but specifically formed by an intricate interplay between i) specific glands, ii) secreted amino acid conjugates of highly specific odorants and iii) selective enzymes present in microorganisms colonizing our skin, providing a natural 'controlled-release' mechanism. Within a multidisciplinary research project, we were able to elucidate the structure of key body odorants, isolate and characterize secreted amino acid conjugates and identify the enzymes responsible for odour release. These enzymes then served as targets for the development of specific active compounds in an almost medicinal chemistry approach, an approach rarely used in the cosmetic field so far. Here we review the key new insights into the biochemistry of human body odour formation, with some remarks on the experimental steps undertaken and hurdles encountered. The development of deodorant actives and the difficult path to market for such specifically acting cosmetic actives is discussed. The basic insights into the biochemistry also opened the way to address some questions in population genetics: Why have large proportions of Asians lost the 'ability' to form body odours? Do twins smell the same? Are our typical body odours indeed influenced by the immune system as often claimed? After addressing these questions, I'll conclude with the key remaining challenges in this field on an ecological niche that is 'anatomically very close to our heart'. ",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

These fundamental questions are not answered within the sphere of smell science; we do not know what it is about a molecule that ... smells.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

By applying a two-step statistical procedure to the descriptors generated for a set of 153 representative solvents, a clustering into 10 classes leads to an optimal classification that is compared to the classical Chastrette's classification. The investigation of nitrocellulose solubility allows a validation of the proposed classification, which can be extended also to solvent mixtures.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

QSPR models for each scale were constructed using only theoretical descriptors. The high quality of the models is reflected by the squared multiple correlation coefficients that range from 0.726 to 0.999; only 18 models have R2&lt; 0.800. This enables direct theoretical calculation of predicted values for any scale and/or for any organic solvent, including those previously unmeasured. The molecular descriptors involved in the models are classified and discussed according to (i) the origin of their calculation (i.e., constitutional, geometric, charge-related, etc.) and (ii) the commonly accepted classification of physical interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in liquid (condensed) media. A reduced matrix 774 (solvents) x 100 (solvent scales) was selected for the principal component analysis (PCA) by taking into account only the solvent scales with more than 20 experimental data points. The first 5 principal components account for 75% of the total variance. The robustness of the PCA model obtained was validated by the comparison models development for restricted submatrices of data and with the results obtained for the full data set. The total variance accounted for by the first three PCs, for the submatrices with the same number of solvent scales but different numbers of solvents, varies from 68.2% to 59.0%. This demonstrates that the total variance described by the first 3 components is essentially stable as the number of solvents involved varies from 100 to 774. Subsequently, a matrix with 703 diverse solvents and 100 solvent scales was selected for the general classification of the solvents and scales according to the scores and loadings obtained from the PCA treatment. Classification of the theoretical molecular descriptors, derived from the chemical structure alone, according to their relevance to specific types of intermolecular interaction (cavity formation, electrostatic polarization, dispersion, and hydrogen bonding) in liquid media enables a more easily comprehensible physical interpretation of the QSPR of molecular properties in liquids and solutions. The reported QSPR models for solvent scales with theoretical molecular descriptors and the results of the PCA analysis are potentially of great practical importance, as they extend the applicability of correlations with empirical solvent scales to many previously unmeasured systems.",

Looking for solvents for a specific application can be hard, and looking for green alternatives for currently used nonbenign solvents can be even harder.

The solvents are processed by a neural network, the Self-organizing Map of Kohonen, which results in a 2D map of clusters. The resulting clusters are validated both chemically and statistically and are presented in user-friendly visualizations by the SUSSOL (Sustainable Solvents Selection and Substitution Software) software. The software helps the user in exploring the solvent space and in generating and evaluating a list of possible alternatives for a specific solvent. The alternatives are ranked based on their safety, health, and environment scores. Cases are discussed to demonstrate the possibilities of our approach and to show that it can help in the search for more sustainable and greener solvents. The SUSSOL software makes intuitive sense and in most case studies, the software confirms the findings in literature, thus providing a sound platform for selecting the most sustainable solvent candidate.",

The nucleophiles were represented with a series of electronic and steric descriptors and the solvents were represented with principal component analysis (PCA) descriptors based on the ACS Solvent Tool. The models indicated that steric factors do not contribute significantly, because of bias in the experimental database. The most important descriptors are solvent-dependent HOMO energy and Hirshfeld charge of the nucleophilic atom.

We give new presentations of the reaction energies as a function of reaction progress, which allow the generation of unified reaction coordinate diagrams that show a linear relationship between the hybridization metric of reaction progress and the relative energies of the stationary points on the potential surface as a function of structure and solvent as originally envisaged by Leffler and Hammond.",

Instead of focusing on symmetry conservation along the minimum energy path, we suggest that the distortion with respect to the original expected symmetry must attain a certain minimal value, not necessarily zero. To demonstrate this approach we studied the effect of solvents on the symmetry and reactivity of the classical [4 + 2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition of (E,E)-1,4-dimethoxy-1,3-butadiene with tetracyanoethylene, revealing the predictive value of this approach. Calculations of the enthalpy of activation and the charge separation at the transition state (TS) predict increased reactivity with the polarity of the solvent. The symmetry measure is in excellent correlation with the enthalpy of activation and the charge separation at the TS, indicating the higher reactivity of the more symmetric case, thus quantifying the main teaching of the WH rules.

In this regard, the search for more efficient and clean alternatives to achieve the chemical activation of molecules involved in chemical transformations has played a prominent role in recent years. The use of microwave or UV-Vis light irradiation, and mechanochemical activation is already widespread in many laboratories. Nevertheless, an additional condition to achieve \"green\" processes comes from the point of view of so-called atom economy. The removal of solvents from chemical reactions generally leads to cleaner, more efficient and more economical processes.

In such case experimental data do not support the correctness of the large cohesive energy density as the ultimate cause of hydrophobicity.

The polarised and depolarised spectra of the induced (ν2, ν3) modes of CS2 and of the ν1-2ν2 Fermi resonance dyad of both CO2 and CS2 have been measured. Upon dilution with CO2, the evolution of the spectroscopic observables of all these modes displays a \"plateau-like\" region in the CO2 mole fraction 0.3-0.7 never previously observed in CO2-organic liquids mixtures. The bandshape and intensity of the induced modes of CS2 are similar to those of pure CS2 up to equimolar concentration, after which variations occur. The preservation of the local ordering from pure CS2 to equimolar concentration together with the non-linear evolution of the spectroscopic observables allows inferring that two solvation regimes exist with a transition occurring in the plateau domain. In the first regime, corresponding to CS2 concentrated mixtures, the liquid phase is segregated with dominant CS2 clusters, whereas, in the second one, CO2 monomers and dimers and CO2-CS2 hetero-dimers coexist dynamically on a picosecond time-scale. It is demonstrated that the subtle interplay between attractive and repulsive interactions which provides a molecular interpretation of the non-ideality of the CO2-CS2 mixture allows rationalizing the volume expansion and the existence of the plateau-like region observed in the pressure-composition diagram previously ascribed to the proximity of an upper critical solution temperature at lower temperatures.

Large experimental EDF spectral magnitudes for BN are seen to peak in regions with no corresponding peaks in the EA spectrum and only a shoulder in the ECD spectrum.

Studies on 6,6'-dibromo-[1,1'-binaphthalene]-2,2'-diol also show similar characteristics in the EDF spectra, though not as pronounced and with different solvent effects.

The significance of these systems lies in the fact, that steric crowding effects enable a stabilization of the central carbon bond that possesses an extended length (1.6 to 1.7 Å) beyond conventional carbon-carbon bonds due to the steric repulsion of the attached hydrocarbon groups. The total stability of these molecules therefore depends on a delicate balance between attractive interaction forces on the one hand and on repulsive forces on the other hand. We have quantified the different interaction energy contributions using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory based on a density functional theory description of the monomers. It has been found that the attractive dispersion interactions increase more strongly with the level of crowding in the systems than the counteracting exchange interactions.

We locate the characteristic temperature theta(A)(N) at which the second virial coefficient vanishes and the transition temperature theta(R)(N) at which radius of gyration R(g) of the chain varies most rapidly with temperature, i.e., d(2)R(g)/dT(2)|(theta(R)) = 0.

Reference data to parameterize MOSCED was generated with knowledge only of chemical structure by performing solvation free energy calculations using electronic structure calculations in the SMD continuum solvent. To maintain simplicity and use only a single method, we approximate the distribution coefficient with the partition coefficient of the neutral species. Over the final SAMPL5 set of 53 compounds, we achieved an average unsigned error of [Formula: see text] log units (ranking 15 out of 62 entries), the correlation coefficient (R) was [Formula: see text] (ranking 35), and [Formula: see text] of the predictions had the correct sign (ranking 30). While used here to predict cyclohexane/water distribution coefficients at 298 K, MOSCED is broadly applicable, allowing one to predict temperature dependent infinite dilution activity coefficients in any solvent for which parameters exist, and provides a means by which an excess Gibbs free energy model may be parameterized to predict composition dependent phase-equilibrium.",

In this study the properties of NCT plus ammonium chloride have been investigated. The reaction of active chlorine compounds like chloramine-T (N-chlorotoluene-sulfonamide sodium), chloroisocyanuric acid derivatives, hypochlorites (NaOCl, CaOCl(2)) with ammonium chloride did not stop at the stage of monochloramine, and the pungent smelling by-products di- and trichloramine, NHCl(2) and NCl(3), were also formed. This was not the case with NCT where only monochloramine was generated. The equilibrium constant of the reaction of NCT with ammonium was found to be [Formula: see text] , which allows to estimate the equilibrium concentration of monochloramine in aqueous solutions of NCT and ammonium chloride. At concentrations each ranging between 0.01% and 1.0% it comes to [NH(2)Cl]=3.5-254 ppm. As an unexpected result the monochloramine containing formulation turned out to be most stable in plain water without buffer additives. Quantitative killing assays revealed complete inactivation of 10(6) to 10(7)CFU/mL of seven bacterial strains by 0.1% NCT plus 0.1% ammonium chloride within 5 min, while with plain 0.1% NCT an incubation time of 2-4h was needed to achieve the same effect.

Populations regularly in contact with chlorination products such as swimmers, lifeguards or workers using chlorine as cleaning or bleaching agent show increased risks of allergic diseases or of respiratory disorders frequently associated with allergy. Experimental evidence suggests that chlorination products promote allergic sensitization by compromising the permeability or the immunoregulatory function of epithelial barriers. These findings led to the chlorine hypothesis proposing that the rise of allergic diseases could result less from the declining exposure to microbial agents (the hygiene hypothesis) than from the increasing and largely uncontrolled exposure to products of chlorination, the most widely used method to achieve hygiene in the developed world. Giving the increasing popularity of water recreational areas, there is an obvious need to assess the effects of chlorine-based oxidants on human health and their possible implication in the epidemic of allergic diseases.",

Niclosamide has the potential to treat a broad-range of viral infections if local bioavailability is optimized as mucin-penetrating solutions that can reach the underlying epithelial cells. pH-dependence of supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide were measured in buffered solutions by UV/Vis-spectroscopy for niclosamide from different suppliers (AK Sci and Sigma), as precipitated material, and as cosolvates. Data was compared to predictions from Henderson-Hasselbalch and precipitation-pH models. Optical-microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of original, converted and precipitated niclosamide. Niclosamide from the two suppliers had different polymorphs resulting in different dissolution behavior. Supernatant concentrations of the \"AKSci-polymorph\" increased with increasing pH, from 2.53μM at pH 3.66 to 300μM at pH 9.2, reaching 703μM at pH 9.63. However, the \"Sigma-polymorph\" equilibrated to much lower final supernatant concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH. Similarly, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, or as cosolvates, niclosamide also equilibrated to lower final supernatant concentrations. Polymorph equilibration though was avoided by using a solvent-exchange technique to make the solutions. Given niclosamide's activity as a host cell modulator, optimized niclosamide solutions could represent universal prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays against COVID19, its more contagious variants, and other respiratory viral infections. They are the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, (no cold chain). They now just need testing.",

The minimum concentration of fluoride required for CaF(2) formation is not well known and may depend on whether calcium is available from plaque fluid or only through dissolution of the dental hard tissue. Furthermore, surface adsorption of fluoride to crystals may cause local concentrations necessary for CaF(2) formation. It has been suggested that CaF(2) acts as a pH-controlled reservoir of fluoride. The rate-controlling factor appears to be phosphate, which controls the dissolution rate of CaF(2) at high pH. Increasing fluoride concentration, prolonging the exposure time or using a fluoride solution with low pH can increase CaF(2) formation.

The reported continuous changes in crystal lattice parameters of CS, which are associated with the changes in water stoichiometry, renders CS physically variable, which may complicate formulation and processing. In addition, controversies still remain as to whether CS exists as different stoichiometric hydrates, mainly because of its variable powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Cox, J. S. G. et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 1971, 60, 1458-65), which indicates a variable crystal structure. The objectives of this study are (a) to understand this unusual water uptake in the light of the molecular and crystal structures of CS, (b) to understand the relationship between the crystal structure and the PXRD patterns using Rietveld analysis, and (c) to investigate whether CS exists as different stoichiometric hydrates. The crystal structure of CS containing 6.44 molecules of water per molecule of CS was determined at 295 and 173 K. The packing arrangements in these structures (space group P1) are similar to those in a previous report, in which the water stoichiometry is 5 to 6, but the bond lengths, bond angles, and lattice parameters are different, reflecting the different water stoichiometries. In the crystal structure solved at 295 K, the position of only one of the two sodium ions could be determined. In the crystal structure solved at 173 K, the previously undetermined sodium ion is disordered over three sites, while four of eight water positions are partially occupied. The 2-hydroxy-propane chain that links the two cyclic moieties of CS was found to be flexible, perhaps allowing the CS crystal to accommodate variable amounts of water. The lack of a fixed coordination site for the second sodium ion may contribute to the disorder of the water molecules. The nonstoichiometric water content of CS is mainly attributed to the water molecules that are associated with the two unoccupied sodium sites. From the PXRD patterns of CS powder, equilibrated at various relative humidities, the various lattice parameters, including previously unreported alpha, beta, and gamma values, were calculated using Rietveld analysis. The peak shifts in these PXRD patterns are quantitatively explained by slight changes in the unit cell parameters. The recently described solid forms of CS were prepared and were found to correspond to the original crystalline CS, described by Cox et al. (1971), but with contamination by the known M mesophase in various proportions. The present results support a variable crystal structure and not the existence of different stoichiometric hydrates of CS.",

Our aim was to find the source of that selectivity by studying its reaction-diffusion mechanism both theoretically and experimentally. ClO2 permeation measurements through protein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to reaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and estimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the reaction-diffusion equation were derived. In these calculations evaporation rates of ClO2 were also measured and taken into account. The rate law of the reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to the square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small ones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a bacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, a few minutes of contact time (limited by the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough to kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living tissues of a greater organism safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects when applying it as an antiseptic. Additional properties of ClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly, that bacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with biological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Selectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different biochemistry, but on their different size. We hope initiating clinical applications of this promising local antiseptic.",

Initially, commercially available samples of chlorhexidine acetate (CHXa) and PCA were analyzed with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Two solutions, NaOCl and CHXa, were warmed to 37 degrees C, and when mixed they produced a brown precipitate. This precipitate was separated in half, and pure PCA was added to 1 of the samples for comparison before they were each analyzed with 1H NMR spectroscopy. The peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of CHXa and PCA were assigned to specific protons of the molecules, and the location of the aromatic peaks in the PCA spectrum defined the PCA doublet region. Although the spectrum of the precipitate alone resulted in a complex combination of peaks, on magnification there were no peaks in the PCA doublet region that were intense enough to be quantified. In the spectrum of the precipitate to which PCA was added, 2 peaks do appear in the PCA doublet region. Comparing this spectrum with that of precipitate alone, the peaks in the PCA doublet region are not visible before the addition of PCA. On the basis of this in vitro study, the reaction mixture of NaOCl and CHXa does not produce PCA at any measurable quantity, and further investigation is needed to determine the chemical composition of the brown precipitate.",

Mercury therefore contributes to the history of science throughout times. Knowledge of cinnabar (HgS) is traced back to ancient Assyria and Egypt, but also to China. The Greek philosophers were the initiators of theoretical science. The idea of the four elements, earth, air, water and fire, was introduced mainly by Empedocles and Aristotle in the 5th and 4th century BC. The theory encouraged the hope of transmuting metal to gold. The early development of practical alchemy is obscure, but some hints are given in the encyclopedia compiled by Zosimos about 300 A.D. in Alexandria. It also includes the invention of equipment such as stills, furnaces and heating baths. Medical treatment is described by Pliny and Celsus, e.g. the use of cinnabar in trachoma and venereal diseases. When the Arabs learned Greek alchemy by the Nestorians, they introduced or improved chemical equipments and new chemicals were obtained such as sublimate (HgCl2), different salts, acids, alkaline carbonates and metal oxides. The first recorded account of animal experimentation on the toxicity of mercury comes from Rhazes (al-Razi) in the 9th century and in the 11th century Avicenna (Ibn Sina) had the foresight to recommend the use of mercury only as an external remedy, and quicksilver ointments were used by the Arabs in the treating of skin diseases. In the medieval west scientific experiments were forbidden since the interpretation of the world order should not be changed. Greek and Arabic medicine and alchemy were therefore authoritative and the breakthrough in scientific inventions first appeared after the introduction of the Renaissance. The Renaissance medicine included ancient medicine as well as \"modern medicine\", based on iatrochemistry, and this chemical approach was introduced by Paracelsus. The medicine included sulphur and salts or oxides of for instance mercury, copper, iron, antimony, bismuth and lead. Most important was mercury when the outbreak of syphilis appeared in Europe at the end of the 15th century. The Arabian quicksilver ointment was remembered and used for the treatment of syphilis, but the treatment also included pills and ointments of sublimate and calomel (Hg2Cl2). The breakthrough in science was the discovery of oxygen by Priestley in the late 18th century. Priestley heated the oxide of mercury and examined the gas and thereafter Lavoisier recognized that combustion involves oxidation. All this led to a new understanding of respiration and furthermore established the basis of modern chemistry. The apothecaries of the 19th and 20th century showed many colourful mercurials as calomel, sublimate, cinnober, oxides of mercury and mercury. Calomel pills were used in acute and chronic diseases and furthermore as a diuretic drug before the organomercurials appeared in the 1920s. Skin diseases were treated with ointments or plasters of the mercurials or quicksilver. Antiseptics were introduced by Semmelweis hand-washing with chlorinated water before deliveries in obstetrics and by Lister's antiseptic ritual with carbolic acid during surgical operations. Also organomercurial \"antiseptics\" were used but unfortunately these agents were bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal and allergic contact dermatitis has been observed. Today the problems are solved by sterilization and aseptic conditions. Penicillin appeared in the 1940s and chlorothiazide in 1957 and new effective agents have taken over in the treatment of diseases with mercurials.",

The solubility and aggregation properties of CHX salts were determined to guide the development of a sustained release formulation for long-term disinfection. The amount of CHX in solution was determined as a function of counterion concentration (chloride, acetate (Ac) or gluconate (G)) by UV spectrophotometry at 255nm. The weight average molecular weight was determined from the angular dependence of the scattered light. Proton NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the dependence of the peak intensity and chemical shift on solution concentration and diffusion measurements were performed by Fourier-transform pulsed-field gradient spin-echo (PFG-SE) (1)H NMR. The observed CHX concentration was highly dependent on the type and concentration of salt present in solution with the greatest CHX concentration achieved with gluconate, moderate to low with diacetate, and very low with dichloride solutions. Addition of sodium gluconate enhanced the amount of CHX-Ac(2) in solution; however, only low concentrations of chlorhexidine can be achieved in the presence of chloride ions. For solutions of CHX-G(2), the aggregate number appeared to range from a dimer at 40mM to perhaps a pentamer at 150mM. In contrast, no aggregation of CHX-Cl(2) or CHX-Ac(2) was detected, which was corroborated by diffusion NMR results. The change in chemical shift of protons is consistent with association of the phenyl group of one CHX with the hexamethylene chain of a second CHX. Based on the analysis of NMR peak intensities of CHX, gluconate, and acetate in saturated solutions, it appears that solubilization of the diacetate species occurs within digluconate aggregates, since the solubility product of chlorhexidine diacetate is such that the concentration of CHX will exceed the critical micelle concentration (CMC). However, no solubilization of CHX-Cl(2) occurs because the solubility product falls below the CMC. The low concentration of CHX that can be achieved in physiological concentrations of chloride in the oral cavity may be problematic for dental and slow release formulations. Achieving a high concentration of CHX appears to require that the monomer be present at a concentration greater than that required to produce self-association.",

UC-1 was determined to contain 2000 ppm of gaseous chlorine dioxide in water. The efficacy and safety of UC-1 were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was more than 98.2% reduction when UC-1 concentrations were 5 and 20 ppm for bacteria and fungi, respectively. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub50</sub) of H1N1, influenza virus B/TW/71718/04, and EV71 were 84.65 ± 0.64, 95.91 ± 11.61, and 46.39 ± 1.97 ppm, respectively. A 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test revealed that the cell viability of mouse lung fibroblast L929 cells was 93.7% at a 200 ppm UC-1 concentration that is over that anticipated in routine use. Moreover, 50 ppm UC-1 showed no significant symptoms in a rabbit ocular irritation test. In an inhalation toxicity test, treatment with 20 ppm UC-1 for 24 h showed no abnormality and no mortality in clinical symptoms and normal functioning of the lung and other organs. A ClO₂ concentration of up to 40 ppm in drinking water did not show any toxicity in a subchronic oral toxicity test. Herein, UC-1 showed favorable disinfection activity and a higher safety profile tendency than in previous reports.",

Using commercially available CHX gluconate, a 2% solution was formed and mixed in a 1:1 ratio with commercially available NaOCl producing a brown precipitate. The precipitate as well as a mixture of precipitate and pure CHX diacetate was then analyzed using one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra were fully assigned in terms of chemical shifts of all proton and carbon atoms in intact CHX. This permitted identification of two major CHX breakdown products, neither of which are parachloroaniline (PCA). Both products are related to PCA in that they are parasubstituted benzene compounds. Based on NMR data and a proposed mechanism of CHX breakdown, the products appear to be parachlorophenylurea (PCU) and parachlorophenylguanidyl-1,6-diguanidyl-hexane (PCGH). Based on this in vitro study, the precipitate formed by NaOCl and CHX is composed of at least two separate molecules, all of which are smaller in size than CHX.

The Ca2+ concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry as a function of time. These measurements were divided into two phases: dissolution, to check the loss of Ca2+ from the tooth structure itself, for which all canals were kept empty and open in the absence of medication for 1168 h, and diffusion, in which the specimens were divided into 10 groups (3 control groups: group 1 = water control, group 2 = sealing control, and group 3 = open canal dissolution control; 7 experimental groups in which the whose canals were filled with Ca(OH)2 paste associated with the following vehicles: group 4 = saline; group 5 = polyethylene glycol (Calen); group 6 = glycerin and camphorated parachlorophenol group 7 = camphorated paramonochlorophenol; group 8 = glycerin; group 9 = glycerin and tricresol formaldehyde (TCF); and group 10 = anesthetic solution.

Today, breathing in the microclimate of caves with their stable air temperature and moderate to high humidity in the presence of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium and the absence of airborne pollutants and pollen is called speleotherapy. The inhalation of natural pure sodium chloride (NaCl) in a controlled environment (air temperature 18° to 24°C and relative humidity 40% to 60%) is called halotherapy. The main active ingredient in halo- and speleotherapy is NaCl aerosol particles, which penetrate all layers of the respiratory tract. In addition to their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, salt particles also facilitate mucociliary transport and reduce immunogloblin E (IgE) levels. Clinical trials have confirmed that salt therapy is an effective option for relieving symptoms and improving functional parameters in sinusitis, bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, mild and moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Rinsing with hypertonic saline has been found to be beneficial in reducing airway inflammation in patients with bronchiolitis. In addition to avoidance, salt therapy should be recommended as a complementary therapy in patients with prolonged exposure to indoor air dampness microbiota, which may cause damage to the respiratory mucosa.

For the two N atoms, two prereaction complexes with C(s) symmetry are generated and there exists seven possible subsequent reaction routes, of which routes 1, 2, 5, and 7 are the main channels. Routes 1, 2, and 5 are associated with HF elimination, with H from the amino group or imido group, and route 7 involves the N-N bond break.

In the present work, the geometry optimizations and energy calculations for all species involved in the title reaction were performed at several high levels of theory. The reaction mechanism of the title reaction is discussed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//CCSD/6-31G(d,p) theoretical level.

The fluoroethyl radical can further decompose into a hydrogen atom and fluoroethylene, with an energy release of 10.33 kcal/mol. Besides the direct departure of the hydrogen atom from the fluoroethyl radical, an indirect decomposition pathway may also be open, which has not been reported before. In addition, the formation of a fluoroethyl radical from a separate fluorine atom and ethylene is described pictorially via the molecular intrinsic characteristic contour (MICC) and the electron density mapped on it. Thereby, strong interpolarization and evident electron transfer between the fluorine atom and ethylene are observed as they approach each other.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The total rate constant for the reaction has been measured by means of the cavity ring-down spectrometry (CRDS) in the temperature range 299-501 K at pressures covering 20-75 Torr. The overall bimolecular rate constant can be represented by the expression k = (2.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(11) exp[-(700 +/- 30)/T] cm3 mol-1 s-1, which is slightly faster than for the analogous C6H5 + CH2O reaction determined with the same method in the same temperature range. The reaction mechanism for the C6H5 + CH3CHO reaction was also explored with quantum-chemical calculations at various hybrid density functional theories (DFTs) and using ab initio high-level composite methods. The theories predict that the reaction may occur by two hydrogen-abstraction and two addition channels with the aldehydic hydrogen-abstraction reaction being dominant. The rate constant calculated by the transition state theory for the aldehydic hydrogen-abstraction reaction is in good agreement with the experimental result after a very small adjustment of the predicted reaction barrier (+0.3 kcal mol-1). Contributions from other product channels are negligible under our experimental conditions. For combustion applications, we have calculated the rate constants for key product channels in the temperature range of 298-2500 K under atmospheric-pressure conditions; they can be represented by the following expressions in units of cm 3mol-1 s-1: k1,cho = 8.8 x 10(3)T2.6 exp(-90/T), k2,ch3 = 6.0 x 10(1)T3.3 exp(-950/T), k3a(C6H5COCH3 + H) = 4.2 x 10(5)T0.6 exp(-410/T) and k3b(C6H5CHO + CH3) = 6.6 x 10(9)T-0.5 exp(-310/T).",

According to a recent paper reported by Hasson et al., [J. Phys. Chem., 2004, 108, 5979-5989] this reaction may proceed by three different channels: CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (1a); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OH + O(3) (1b); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)O + OH + O(2) (1c). In experiments, CH(3)C(O)O(2) and HO(2) radicals were generated using Cl-initiated oxidation of acetaldehyde and methanol, respectively, in the presence of oxygen. The addition of amounts of benzene in the system, forming hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals in the presence of OH, allowed us to answer that channel (1c) is &lt;10%. The rate constant k(1) of reaction (1) has been finally measured at (1.50 +/- 0.08) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K, after having considered the combination of all the possible values for the branching ratios k(1a)/k(1,)k(1b)/k(1,)k(1c)/k(1) and has been compared to previous measurements. The branching ratio k(1b)/k(1), determined by measuring ozone in situ, was found to be equal to (20 +/- 1)%, a value consistent with the previous values reported in the literature. DFT calculations show that channel (1c) is also of minor importance: it was deduced unambiguously that the formation of CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)(g)) is the dominant product channel, followed by the second channel (1b) leading to CH(3)C(O)OH and singlet O(3) and, much less importantly, channel (1c) which corresponds to OH formation. These conclusions give a reliable explanation of the experimental observations of this work. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2) is still predominantly a radical chain termination reaction in the tropospheric ozone chain formation processes.",

In principle the O ((1)D) atom can be generated with a large endothermicity of 56.9 kcal/mol; on the other hand, its barrierless reaction with Cl(2) can readily form ClClO ((1)A'), which fragments rapidly to give ClO + Cl. The rate constants of both forward and reverse processes have been predicted at 150-2000 K by the microcanonical variational transition state theory (VTST)/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory. The predicted rate constants are in good agreement with available experimental data within reported errors.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

This approach provides an a priori classification without requiring the knowledge of any experimental data. The theoretical descriptors of the proposed classification are generated through the analysis of the COSMO-RS σ-potential profiles. By applying a two-step statistical procedure to the descriptors generated for a set of 153 representative solvents, a clustering into 10 classes leads to an optimal classification that is compared to the classical Chastrette's classification. The investigation of nitrocellulose solubility allows a validation of the proposed classification, which can be extended also to solvent mixtures. This new approach for solvent classification, thus, appears as a consistent tool for the design of new solvents and their formulation.",

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Even though this conceptual perversion has been highlighted by renowned stereochemists, it has become a recurring keyword and a hot message in modern literature.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water.

This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Whereas the solvent is responsible for the tautomerisation equilibrium position, the catalyst only serves to eliminate kinetic control from the reaction. Generally, to preserve reaction efficiency and improve sustainability, bio-derivable p-cymene was found to be a useful solvent.

In this study quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) for negative logarithm of water solubility-logS (mol L(-1)) are built up for five random splits into the sub-training set (≈55%), the calibration set (≈25%), and the test set (≈20%). Simplified molecular input-line entry system (SMILES) is used as the representation of the molecular structure. Optimal SMILES-based descriptors are calculated by means of the Monte Carlo method using the CORAL software (http://www.insilico.eu/coral). These one-variable models for water solubility are characterized by the following average values of the statistical characteristics: n(sub_train)=725-763; n(calib)=312-343; n(test)=231-261; r(sub_train)(2)=0.9211±0.0028; r(calib)(2)=0.9555±0.0045; r(test)(2)=0.9365±0.0073; s(sub_train)=0.561±0.0086; s(calib)=0.453±0.0209; s(test)=0.520±0.0205. Thus, the reproducibility of statistical quality of suggested models for water solubility confirmed for five various splits.",

One of the most attractive challenges is finding, creating and developing new and green media. Over the last decades, the scientific community has mainly focused on two different classes of solvents (namely, Ionic liquids and Eutectic Solvents). These solvents share advantageous characteristics (low vapor pressure, thermally stable, non-flammable, etc …) making them an attractive option to implement sustainable chemistry and engineering. Mainly due to its environmental and economic features, DES are now growing much more interest. Indeed, although their ecotoxicological profile is still poorly known, DES are classified as \"green\" solvents because they are composed of molecules which are considered to be eco-friendly.

New evidence and opinion.\nThe effects of two polar co-solvents, chlorodifluoromethane and acetone, on the solubility and enthalpy of a solution of 1,4-naphthoquinone in supercritical (SC) CO2 were studied. We found that the dissolution process becomes less exothermic in the presence of the co-solvents relative to that in pure CO2, although the solubility is enhanced significantly by the co-solvents. This indicates that the increase in the solubility by adding co-solvents results from the increase of the entropy of solution. On the basis of the unexpected results we propose a new mechanism for the solubility enhancement of the solute by the co-solvents in supercritical fluids (SCF); this should be applicable to cases in which the local density of the SC solvent around the solute and the co-solvent is larger, and the co-solvent associates preferentially with the solute.

It was found that addition of water in unimolar proportions with some organic solvents increases theobromine solubility compared to neat solvents. Additionally, using NADES results in a solubility increase of the studied compound not only in relation to water but also DMSO. The addition of water (0.2 molar fraction) to NADES is responsible for an even larger increase of solubility. The measured solubilities were interpreted in terms of three theoretical frameworks. The first one-belonging to the set of data reduction techniques-proved to be very efficient in quantitative back-computations of excess solubility of theobromine in all studied systems. The default approach utilizing the well-recognized COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) framework offered at most a qualitative solubility description. The extended search for possible contacts provided evidence for the existence of many intermolecular complexes that alter the electron density of the solute molecule, thus influencing solubility computations.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

Understanding the solvent behavior of liquid and scCO(2) is of critical importance to enable the design of CO(2)-philic molecular systems and to expand the use of these solvent systems to a wider range of chemical processes. Historically CO(2) was treated as a nonpolar solvent, primarily because of its low dielectric constant and zero molecular dipole moment. CO(2) has also been described as a quadrupolar solvent because of its significant quadrupole moment. Recent studies suggest that, as far as the microscopic solvent behavior of CO(2) is concerned, CO(2) has the potential to act as both a weak Lewis acid and Lewis base. Also, strong theoretical and experimental evidence indicates that CO(2) can participate in conventional or nonconventional hydrogen-bonding interactions. All of these site-specific solute-solvent interactions are important to understand the fundamental nature of CO(2) as a solvent.

In the present work, vibration spectroscopy, calorimetric measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Raman and infrared spectra suggest that SA exists predominately as dimers in chloroform, but in the other five solvents there is no clear evidence of dimerization. In all solvents, the shift in the SA carbonyl peak reflecting the strength in the solvent-solute interaction is quite well correlated to the nucleation ranking. This shift is corroborated by DFT calculated energies of binding one solvent molecule to the carboxyl group of SA. An even better correlation of the influence of the solvent on the nucleation is provided by DFT calculated energy of binding the complete first solvation shell to the SA molecule. These solvation shell binding energies are corroborated by the enthalpy of solvent-solute interaction as estimated from experimentally determined enthalpy of solution and calculated enthalpy of cavity formation using the scaled particle theory. The different methods reveal a consistent picture and suggest that the stronger the solvent binds to the SA molecule in solution, the slower the nucleation becomes. ",

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers.

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

Although such terms are precisely defined, their use often engenders confusion and ambiguity. Perhaps, the most improper use of chirality, yet widely accepted, is related to its association with stereodynamics and physico-chemical transformations, such as chiral discrimination, chiral resolution, chiral recognition, chiral synthesis, and so on. Even though this conceptual perversion has been highlighted by renowned stereochemists, it has become a recurring keyword and a hot message in modern literature. It is timely to renew the correct use and context in forums such as the present journal, adding further reflections that may help both beginners and practitioners.

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

Our calculations show that the concerted non-ionic pathway, which is the least energetic in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane, becomes more energetic the more polar the solvent. After investigating a variety of non-ionic and ionic pathways in water, it is found that the addition step seems to be ionic but the migration step, which is rate-determining, is uncatalyzed, non-ionic and fully concerted. These results confirm the experimental findings in solvents of low to medium polarity that the rate constant of the reaction decreases as the solvent polarity increases. Moreover, we find that contrary to what is commonly accepted, in the addition and migration ionic steps the deprotonation of the ionic species occurs in a concerted manner with the other chemical events taking place.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

According to this concept, the conventional organic solvent medium used in catalytic chemical reactions is replaced substantially (up to 80 vol %) by CO(2), at moderate pressures (tens of bars), to create a continuum of CO(2)-expanded solvent media. A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

It was shown that the gas-phase reaction of W with CO2 proceeds with a negligible barrier via an insertion pathway, W(7S)+CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta2-OCO)(6A')--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)(1A)--&gt;WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma). This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center. The overall reaction W+(6D) + CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta1-OCO)+(6A)--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)+(4A)--&gt;WO+(4Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma) is calculated to be exothermic by 25.4 kcal/mol.

The inclusion of vibrational and thermal corrections and of entropic effects increases the relative energy of the zwitterion to 14.7 kcal mol(-1). Bending of the CO2 geometry increases its acidity due to a 1.09 eV reduction in the LUMO energy. Calculation of the CO2 interaction energy with a set of amines revealed that the interaction energies show a high correlation with their basicities, with the stronger bases stabilizing the zwitterion.

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C.

The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The calculation indicates that the hydrogen abstraction from -CH(2)- group is the dominant reaction channel, and the displacement process may be negligible because of the high barrier.

Finally, we investigate the correlation of the relative stability with simple chemical descriptors: changes in packing efficiency and hydrogen bond strength. We find some broad qualitative agreement with chemical intuition-more densely packed cocrystals with stronger hydrogen bonding tend to be more stable-but the relationship is weak, suggesting that such simple descriptors do not capture the complex balance of interactions driving cocrystallization.

In this study the properties of NCT plus ammonium chloride have been investigated. The reaction of active chlorine compounds like chloramine-T (N-chlorotoluene-sulfonamide sodium), chloroisocyanuric acid derivatives, hypochlorites (NaOCl, CaOCl(2)) with ammonium chloride did not stop at the stage of monochloramine, and the pungent smelling by-products di- and trichloramine, NHCl(2) and NCl(3), were also formed. This was not the case with NCT where only monochloramine was generated. The equilibrium constant of the reaction of NCT with ammonium was found to be [Formula: see text] , which allows to estimate the equilibrium concentration of monochloramine in aqueous solutions of NCT and ammonium chloride. At concentrations each ranging between 0.01% and 1.0% it comes to [NH(2)Cl]=3.5-254 ppm. As an unexpected result the monochloramine containing formulation turned out to be most stable in plain water without buffer additives. Quantitative killing assays revealed complete inactivation of 10(6) to 10(7)CFU/mL of seven bacterial strains by 0.1% NCT plus 0.1% ammonium chloride within 5 min, while with plain 0.1% NCT an incubation time of 2-4h was needed to achieve the same effect. The highly significant increase of bactericidal activity (200-300-fold) could be assigned to the presence of monochloramine which could be isolated by vacuum distillation.

Niclosamide has the potential to treat a broad-range of viral infections if local bioavailability is optimized as mucin-penetrating solutions that can reach the underlying epithelial cells. pH-dependence of supernatant concentrations and dissolution rates of niclosamide were measured in buffered solutions by UV/Vis-spectroscopy for niclosamide from different suppliers (AK Sci and Sigma), as precipitated material, and as cosolvates. Data was compared to predictions from Henderson-Hasselbalch and precipitation-pH models. Optical-microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of original, converted and precipitated niclosamide. Niclosamide from the two suppliers had different polymorphs resulting in different dissolution behavior. Supernatant concentrations of the \"AKSci-polymorph\" increased with increasing pH, from 2.53μM at pH 3.66 to 300μM at pH 9.2, reaching 703μM at pH 9.63. However, the \"Sigma-polymorph\" equilibrated to much lower final supernatant concentrations, reflective of more stable polymorphs at each pH. Similarly, when precipitated from supersaturated solution, or as cosolvates, niclosamide also equilibrated to lower final supernatant concentrations. Polymorph equilibration though was avoided by using a solvent-exchange technique to make the solutions. Given niclosamide's activity as a host cell modulator, optimized niclosamide solutions could represent universal prophylactic nasal and early treatment throat sprays against COVID19, its more contagious variants, and other respiratory viral infections. They are the simplest and potentially most effective formulations from both an efficacy standpoint as well as manufacturing and distribution, (no cold chain). They now just need testing.",

Initially, commercially available samples of chlorhexidine acetate (CHXa) and PCA were analyzed with 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

This precipitate was separated in half, and pure PCA was added to 1 of the samples for comparison before they were each analyzed with 1H NMR spectroscopy. The peaks in the 1H NMR spectra of CHXa and PCA were assigned to specific protons of the molecules, and the location of the aromatic peaks in the PCA spectrum defined the PCA doublet region. Although the spectrum of the precipitate alone resulted in a complex combination of peaks, on magnification there were no peaks in the PCA doublet region that were intense enough to be quantified. In the spectrum of the precipitate to which PCA was added, 2 peaks do appear in the PCA doublet region. Comparing this spectrum with that of precipitate alone, the peaks in the PCA doublet region are not visible before the addition of PCA.

The solid-state behavior of CS is still not completely understood. CS forms nonstoichiometric hydrates and sorbs and liberates water in a continuous manner, although with hysteresis. The reported continuous changes in crystal lattice parameters of CS, which are associated with the changes in water stoichiometry, renders CS physically variable, which may complicate formulation and processing. In addition, controversies still remain as to whether CS exists as different stoichiometric hydrates, mainly because of its variable powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Cox, J. S. G. et al. J. Pharm. Sci. 1971, 60, 1458-65), which indicates a variable crystal structure. The objectives of this study are (a) to understand this unusual water uptake in the light of the molecular and crystal structures of CS, (b) to understand the relationship between the crystal structure and the PXRD patterns using Rietveld analysis, and (c) to investigate whether CS exists as different stoichiometric hydrates. The crystal structure of CS containing 6.44 molecules of water per molecule of CS was determined at 295 and 173 K. The packing arrangements in these structures (space group P1) are similar to those in a previous report, in which the water stoichiometry is 5 to 6, but the bond lengths, bond angles, and lattice parameters are different, reflecting the different water stoichiometries. In the crystal structure solved at 295 K, the position of only one of the two sodium ions could be determined. In the crystal structure solved at 173 K, the previously undetermined sodium ion is disordered over three sites, while four of eight water positions are partially occupied. The 2-hydroxy-propane chain that links the two cyclic moieties of CS was found to be flexible, perhaps allowing the CS crystal to accommodate variable amounts of water. The lack of a fixed coordination site for the second sodium ion may contribute to the disorder of the water molecules. The nonstoichiometric water content of CS is mainly attributed to the water molecules that are associated with the two unoccupied sodium sites. From the PXRD patterns of CS powder, equilibrated at various relative humidities, the various lattice parameters, including previously unreported alpha, beta, and gamma values, were calculated using Rietveld analysis. The peak shifts in these PXRD patterns are quantitatively explained by slight changes in the unit cell parameters. The recently described solid forms of CS were prepared and were found to correspond to the original crystalline CS, described by Cox et al. (1971), but with contamination by the known M mesophase in various proportions. The present results support a variable crystal structure and not the existence of different stoichiometric hydrates of CS.",

The minimum concentration of fluoride required for CaF(2) formation is not well known and may depend on whether calcium is available from plaque fluid or only through dissolution of the dental hard tissue. Furthermore, surface adsorption of fluoride to crystals may cause local concentrations necessary for CaF(2) formation. It has been suggested that CaF(2) acts as a pH-controlled reservoir of fluoride. The rate-controlling factor appears to be phosphate, which controls the dissolution rate of CaF(2) at high pH. Increasing fluoride concentration, prolonging the exposure time or using a fluoride solution with low pH can increase CaF(2) formation. CaF(2) formed at low pH contains less internal phosphate which has been shown to be less soluble. This may be of clinical significance for fluoride applied topically a few times per year.",

The solubility and aggregation properties of CHX salts were determined to guide the development of a sustained release formulation for long-term disinfection. The amount of CHX in solution was determined as a function of counterion concentration (chloride, acetate (Ac) or gluconate (G)) by UV spectrophotometry at 255nm. The weight average molecular weight was determined from the angular dependence of the scattered light. Proton NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the dependence of the peak intensity and chemical shift on solution concentration and diffusion measurements were performed by Fourier-transform pulsed-field gradient spin-echo (PFG-SE) (1)H NMR. The observed CHX concentration was highly dependent on the type and concentration of salt present in solution with the greatest CHX concentration achieved with gluconate, moderate to low with diacetate, and very low with dichloride solutions. Addition of sodium gluconate enhanced the amount of CHX-Ac(2) in solution; however, only low concentrations of chlorhexidine can be achieved in the presence of chloride ions. For solutions of CHX-G(2), the aggregate number appeared to range from a dimer at 40mM to perhaps a pentamer at 150mM. In contrast, no aggregation of CHX-Cl(2) or CHX-Ac(2) was detected, which was corroborated by diffusion NMR results. The change in chemical shift of protons is consistent with association of the phenyl group of one CHX with the hexamethylene chain of a second CHX. Based on the analysis of NMR peak intensities of CHX, gluconate, and acetate in saturated solutions, it appears that solubilization of the diacetate species occurs within digluconate aggregates, since the solubility product of chlorhexidine diacetate is such that the concentration of CHX will exceed the critical micelle concentration (CMC). However, no solubilization of CHX-Cl(2) occurs because the solubility product falls below the CMC. The low concentration of CHX that can be achieved in physiological concentrations of chloride in the oral cavity may be problematic for dental and slow release formulations. Achieving a high concentration of CHX appears to require that the monomer be present at a concentration greater than that required to produce self-association.",

The physicochemical characteristics of APA-22 HCl were studied at 25 degrees C by using equilibrium surface tension (gamma), solubilization of an oil-soluble dye, steady-state fluorescence, and chloride ion selective electrode techniques. The APA-22 HCl salt is considered to form an aggregate at a concentration, C(1), which is about twice the concentration of the solubility limit of APAs with shorter alkyl chains.

Our aim was to find the source of that selectivity by studying its reaction-diffusion mechanism both theoretically and experimentally. ClO2 permeation measurements through protein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to reaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and estimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the reaction-diffusion equation were derived. In these calculations evaporation rates of ClO2 were also measured and taken into account. The rate law of the reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to the square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small ones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a bacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, a few minutes of contact time (limited by the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough to kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living tissues of a greater organism safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects when applying it as an antiseptic. Additional properties of ClO2, advantageous for an antiseptic, are also discussed. Most importantly, that bacteria are not able to develop resistance against ClO2 as it reacts with biological thiols which play a vital role in all living organisms. Selectivity of ClO2 between humans and bacteria is based not on their different biochemistry, but on their different size.

In early work the CaF2 formed during topical application with fluoride was assumed to be beneficial. It was suggested that it could protect the enamel surface directly or provide free fluoride ions for subsequent incorporation into the hydroxyapatite lattice. However, McCann claimed, in 1968, that CaF2 is soluble in saliva (12-15 mg/l), that it would be rapidly lost in the oral cavity, and that the clinical effect of fluoride was related to formation of firmly bound fluoride only. In this period many authors reported total loss of CaF2 during 24 h after a topical application of fluoride. It has now been shown in several laboratories that calcium fluoride is stable in saliva at neutral pH owing to surface adsorption of HPO2-4 to the crystal surface and formation of a solubility-limiting phase. Extended exposure of saliva can cause formation of a fluorapatite layer on the CaF2 crystals, restricting their dissolution further. Low pH (pH less than 5) causes loss of the solubility-limiting adsorbed HPO2-4 and a slow dissolution of CaF2. The CaF2 crystals may thus serve as pH-controlled reservoirs of fluoride ions on the enamel or in plaque and release fluoride during caries challenges. It is suggested that calcium fluoride is an essential phase explaining important aspects of the mechanism of topically applied fluoride, contrary to what was assumed in the past.",

Mercury therefore contributes to the history of science throughout times. Knowledge of cinnabar (HgS) is traced back to ancient Assyria and Egypt, but also to China. The Greek philosophers were the initiators of theoretical science. The idea of the four elements, earth, air, water and fire, was introduced mainly by Empedocles and Aristotle in the 5th and 4th century BC. The theory encouraged the hope of transmuting metal to gold. The early development of practical alchemy is obscure, but some hints are given in the encyclopedia compiled by Zosimos about 300 A.D. in Alexandria. It also includes the invention of equipment such as stills, furnaces and heating baths. Medical treatment is described by Pliny and Celsus, e.g. the use of cinnabar in trachoma and venereal diseases. When the Arabs learned Greek alchemy by the Nestorians, they introduced or improved chemical equipments and new chemicals were obtained such as sublimate (HgCl2), different salts, acids, alkaline carbonates and metal oxides. The first recorded account of animal experimentation on the toxicity of mercury comes from Rhazes (al-Razi) in the 9th century and in the 11th century Avicenna (Ibn Sina) had the foresight to recommend the use of mercury only as an external remedy, and quicksilver ointments were used by the Arabs in the treating of skin diseases. In the medieval west scientific experiments were forbidden since the interpretation of the world order should not be changed. Greek and Arabic medicine and alchemy were therefore authoritative and the breakthrough in scientific inventions first appeared after the introduction of the Renaissance. The Renaissance medicine included ancient medicine as well as \"modern medicine\", based on iatrochemistry, and this chemical approach was introduced by Paracelsus. The medicine included sulphur and salts or oxides of for instance mercury, copper, iron, antimony, bismuth and lead. Most important was mercury when the outbreak of syphilis appeared in Europe at the end of the 15th century. The Arabian quicksilver ointment was remembered and used for the treatment of syphilis, but the treatment also included pills and ointments of sublimate and calomel (Hg2Cl2). The breakthrough in science was the discovery of oxygen by Priestley in the late 18th century. Priestley heated the oxide of mercury and examined the gas and thereafter Lavoisier recognized that combustion involves oxidation. All this led to a new understanding of respiration and furthermore established the basis of modern chemistry. The apothecaries of the 19th and 20th century showed many colourful mercurials as calomel, sublimate, cinnober, oxides of mercury and mercury. Calomel pills were used in acute and chronic diseases and furthermore as a diuretic drug before the organomercurials appeared in the 1920s. Skin diseases were treated with ointments or plasters of the mercurials or quicksilver. Antiseptics were introduced by Semmelweis hand-washing with chlorinated water before deliveries in obstetrics and by Lister's antiseptic ritual with carbolic acid during surgical operations. Also organomercurial \"antiseptics\" were used but unfortunately these agents were bacteriostatic rather than bacteriocidal and allergic contact dermatitis has been observed. Today the problems are solved by sterilization and aseptic conditions. Penicillin appeared in the 1940s and chlorothiazide in 1957 and new effective agents have taken over in the treatment of diseases with mercurials.",

Twenty milliliters of each experimental solution, 0.16% sodium chlorite, 0.25% zinc chloride, 0.1% chlorhexidine and distilled water, was injected into a Teflon bag containing mixed VSCs, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide and mixed vigorously for 30 s. The VSC concentration was measured by gas chromatography before, immediately after, 30 min and 60 min after mixing. The sodium chlorite solution reduced the VSC concentration remarkably. After mixing, nearly all VSCs were eliminated immediately and no VSCs were detected at 30 and 60 min post-mixing. However, in the other solutions, the VSC concentration decreased by ∼30% immediately after mixing and there was no further decrease. The results suggest that sodium chlorite solution has the effect of eliminating gaseous VSCs directly. This must be because it can release chlorine dioxide gas which can react directly with gaseous VSCs. In the case of other solutions that have been proved to be effective to reduce halitosis clinically, it can be proposed that their anti-VSC effect is less likely due to the direct chemical elimination of gaseous VSCs in the mouth.",

The surfactants benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide, Tween 80 and Triton X-100 were mixed at different concentrations with sodium hypochlorite solution (NaOCl), Ca(OCl)2 and distilled water (control). Once the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of the surfactants in Ca(OCl)2 and NaOCl was determined, pH, free chlorine, surface tension and free calcium ions were evaluated. The penetration into dentinal tubules of NaOCl and Ca(OCl)2, with or without benzalkonium chloride and Triton X-100 [surfactants that promoted the lowest surface tension of Ca(OCl)2], was assessed using human premolars stained with crystal violet. The statistical tests were one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-test, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post-test, two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's post-test, and t-test; depending on the assay. The addition of surfactants reduced the surface tension of NaOCl and Ca(OCl)2, and did not alter the pH or the free available chlorine of either solution. The addition of all surfactants increased the availability of free calcium ions in Ca(OCl)2, especially benzalkonium chloride. Ca(OCl)2 exhibited lower penetration into dentinal tubules than NaOCl, and the addition of surfactants did not improve the penetration of Ca(OCl)2, but did increase the penetration of NaOCl.

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments.

This approach provides an a priori classification without requiring the knowledge of any experimental data. The theoretical descriptors of the proposed classification are generated through the analysis of the COSMO-RS σ-potential profiles. By applying a two-step statistical procedure to the descriptors generated for a set of 153 representative solvents, a clustering into 10 classes leads to an optimal classification that is compared to the classical Chastrette's classification.

QSPR models for each scale were constructed using only theoretical descriptors. The high quality of the models is reflected by the squared multiple correlation coefficients that range from 0.726 to 0.999; only 18 models have R2&lt; 0.800. This enables direct theoretical calculation of predicted values for any scale and/or for any organic solvent, including those previously unmeasured. The molecular descriptors involved in the models are classified and discussed according to (i) the origin of their calculation (i.e., constitutional, geometric, charge-related, etc.) and (ii) the commonly accepted classification of physical interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in liquid (condensed) media. A reduced matrix 774 (solvents) x 100 (solvent scales) was selected for the principal component analysis (PCA) by taking into account only the solvent scales with more than 20 experimental data points. The first 5 principal components account for 75% of the total variance. The robustness of the PCA model obtained was validated by the comparison models development for restricted submatrices of data and with the results obtained for the full data set. The total variance accounted for by the first three PCs, for the submatrices with the same number of solvent scales but different numbers of solvents, varies from 68.2% to 59.0%. This demonstrates that the total variance described by the first 3 components is essentially stable as the number of solvents involved varies from 100 to 774. Subsequently, a matrix with 703 diverse solvents and 100 solvent scales was selected for the general classification of the solvents and scales according to the scores and loadings obtained from the PCA treatment. Classification of the theoretical molecular descriptors, derived from the chemical structure alone, according to their relevance to specific types of intermolecular interaction (cavity formation, electrostatic polarization, dispersion, and hydrogen bonding) in liquid media enables a more easily comprehensible physical interpretation of the QSPR of molecular properties in liquids and solutions. The reported QSPR models for solvent scales with theoretical molecular descriptors and the results of the PCA analysis are potentially of great practical importance, as they extend the applicability of correlations with empirical solvent scales to many previously unmeasured systems.",

It is demonstrated that a biocompatible yet poor solvent can be mixed with a toxic solvent that has better extractant properties to yield a mixture with improved solvent characteristics that is still biocompatible.

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The purpose of this work was to examine eutectic solvents as a \"greener\" alternative to conventional solvents so that quaternization reactions take place in accordance with the principles of green chemistry. Herein, sixteen eutectic solvents were used as replacements for volatile organic ones in quaternization reactions of isonicotinamide with substituted phenacyl bromides.

Microwave-assisted organic reactions produced the highest yields, where in several reactions, the yield was almost quantitative.

Choline chloride based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were employed, both as solvents and as catalysts, in the synthesis of coumarin derivatives via Knoevenagel condensation. In order to find the best DES for coumarin synthesis, 20 DESs were tested for the reaction of salicylaldehyde and dimethyl malonate at 80 °C. Among the twenty tested deep eutectic solvents only five were adequate for this kind of synthesis. The best DES for this reaction was found to be the one composed of choline chloride:urea (1:2). Most coumarin compounds were obtained in good to excellent yield. Compounds 1g, 2g and 2p should be pointed out due to their yields of 85, 88 and 98 %, respectively. 3-Acetylcoumarins 5a, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f and 5g were synthesized under ultrasound irradiation and were also obtained in excellent yields of 90, 95, 98, 93, 94 and 85 %, respectively. Series of coumarin derivatives were successfully synthesized, either in choline chloide:urea DES at 80 °C or in ultrasound-assisted reaction, from different salicylaldehydes and active methylene compounds. These \"green\" methods were found to be very effective in Knoevenagel condensation, while DES was recycled for several cycles without any significant influence on the product yield.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Its vast scope, in terms of nucleophile, leaving group, and ring-size of the transition state, make it a powerful tool for arene functionalization, as it can be employed strategically to switch easily-forged bonds with more difficult connections that would be challenging to realize in the intermolecular mode. The reaction has received significantly renewed attention in recent years, as advances in areas such as arene C-X bond formation and radical generation have been harnessed for new arene syntheses through Smiles chemistry. In addition, new reaction modes have been discovered, such as the Clayden rearrangement of lithiated ureas, creating innovative applications for Smiles rearrangements in asymmetric arylation. This Minireview will discuss advances in these areas in the recent literature, covering both two-electron, polar Smiles rearrangements along with single-electron radical transformations.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments.

Fast CO2-uptake kinetics arise from close proximity of the alcohol and amine sites involved in CO2 binding in a concerted fashion, resulting in a Zwitterion containing both an alkyl-carbonate and a protonated amine. The population of internal hydrogen bonds between the two functional groups determines the solution viscosity. Unlike the ion pair interactions in ionic liquids, these observations are novel and specific to a hydrogen-bonding network that can be controlled by chemically tuning single molecule CO2 capture solvents. We present a molecular design strategy to reduce viscosity by shifting the proton transfer equilibrium toward a neutral acid/amine species, as opposed to the ubiquitously accepted zwitterionic state.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity. Accordingly, the areas covered in this special issue focus on structure and dynamics, solvation, the mobility of charged species, and the ability to obtain controllable phase behavior by adding polar diluents or using hydrophobic DESs.",

Dissection of the activation parameters (i.e., ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡)) has revealed that the bell-shaped α-effect behavior is due to entropy of activation differences rather than enthalpy terms, although the enthalpy term controls almost entirely the solvent dependence of the reaction rate.

In this manuscript, we exemplify, demystify, and discuss the crucial role of catalysis, solvent effects, mechanisms, kinetics, facts, presumptions, and myths associated with the Biginelli reaction aiming to avoid current and future confusion and to stimulate new approaches.",

Evidence against nucleophilic solvent participation in the tert-butyl chloride transition state and for increased hydrogen bond donation to the 1-adamantyl chloride solvolysis transition state.\nDespite theoretical calculations to the contrary, it has been argued that the 1-adamantyl cation is more stable than the tert-butyl cation in media of high dielectric constant. This argument has been utilized to suggest that the higher rate of solvolysis of tert-butyl chloride in aqueous ethanol is evidence for nucleophilic solvent participation in this classic reaction. Further, in \"more highly ionizing\" solvents, the rate of 1-adamantyl chloride is nearly the same as that of tert-butyl chloride, which is interpreted as a manifestation of the relative stabilities of the cations. However, the evidence cited does not explain the increased sensitivity of the rate of solvolysis of 1-adamantyl chloride over tert-butyl chloride to solvents which are better able to donate hydrogen bonds. The hypothesis developed here is that 1-adamantyl chloride solvolysis is assisted by hydrogen bond donation departing chloride ion to a greater extent than that of tert-butyl chloride solvolysis, most likely due to lessened steric interactions in a developing pyramidal cation. This hypothesis is supported by multiparameter solvent effect factor analyses utilizing the KOMPH2 equation which, in addition, quantifies the important role of ground-state destabilization due to strong solvent-solvent interactions. An important result from the good correlation of free energies of transfer of the tert-butyl chloride solvolysis transition state is that there is no change in mechanism, and, in particular, no nucleophilic participation even in non-hydroxylic basic solvents. The equation is also applied to the case of dimethylsulfonium ion solvolyses where the tert-butyl salt reacts substantially faster than the 1-adamantyl salt in ethanol and the gas phase. The decreased rate of the former in hydrogen bond donating solvents relative to the gas phase is as yet unclear. Solvent N values that were generated to characterize solvent nucleophilicity are shown not to be correlated by measures of solvent basicity but rather by the negative of measures of solvent hydrogen bond donor ability.",

Continuum solvation methods (EIF-PCM and CPCM) and two density functionals (B3LYP and MPWB1K) are used to study solvent effects on two types of reaction mechanisms: concerted non-ionic and stepwise ionic. The ionic mechanism is the one found in most organic chemistry textbooks; it begins with the protonation of the ketone by the acid catalyst, even though this reaction normally takes place in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane. Our calculations show that the concerted non-ionic pathway, which is the least energetic in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane, becomes more energetic the more polar the solvent. After investigating a variety of non-ionic and ionic pathways in water, it is found that the addition step seems to be ionic but the migration step, which is rate-determining, is uncatalyzed, non-ionic and fully concerted. These results confirm the experimental findings in solvents of low to medium polarity that the rate constant of the reaction decreases as the solvent polarity increases. Moreover, we find that contrary to what is commonly accepted, in the addition and migration ionic steps the deprotonation of the ionic species occurs in a concerted manner with the other chemical events taking place.",

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality.

In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers.

In particular, charges are expected to be completely shielded in RTILs even though their dielectric constants are typically low. This raises the question whether electron transfer (ET) reactions in RTILs can be described in terms of Marcus' theory, a model that is fundamentally based on continuum dielectric theory.

The possible interactions between the cation and the anion of the solvent and both the isomers of the azobenzene derivatives have been studied by small-wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS). The calculated cis population in the photostationary state and the hardness parameter η of the trans isomer show that azobenzene and F-azobenzene are the less reactive molecules for the trans-cis conversion in all the investigated ionic liquids.

The solubility behavior of acetylene in RTILs was examined using a linear solvation energy relationship based on Kamlet-Taft solvent parameters including the hydrogen-bond acidity or donor ability (α), the hydrogen-bond basicity or acceptor ability (β), and the polarity/polarizability (π*). It is found that the solubility of acetylene linearly correlates with β value and is almost independent of α or π*. The solubility of acetylene in RTILs increases with increasing hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) ability of the anion, but is little affected by the nature of the cation. Quantum mechanical calculations demonstrate that the acidic proton of acetylene specifically forms hydrogen bond with a basic oxygen atom on the anion of a RTIL. On the other hand, although C-H···π interaction is plausible, all optimized structures indicate that the acidic protons on the cation do not specifically associate with the π cloud of acetylene. Thermodynamic analysis agrees well with the proposed correlation: the higher the β value of a RTIL is, the more negative the enthalpy of acetylene absorption in the RTIL is.",

From large to very large increases in the HAT rate constant (kH) were measured on going from MeOH and TFE to isooctane (kH(isooctane)/kH(MeOH) = 5-12; kH(isooctane)/kH(TFE) &gt; 80). This behavior was explained in terms of the increase in the extent of charge separation in the amides determined by polar solvents through solvent-amide dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding, where the latter interactions appear to play a major role with strong HBD solvents such as TFE. These interactions increase the electron deficiency of the amide C-H bonds, deactivating these bonds toward HAT to an electrophilic radical such as CumO(•), indicating that changes in solvent polarity and hydrogen bonding can provide a convenient method for deactivation of the C-H bond of amides toward HAT. With DMF, a solvent-induced change in HAT selectivity was observed, suggesting that solvent effects can be successfully employed to control the reaction selectivity in HAT-based procedures for the functionalization of C-H bonds.

In both cases, studies dealing with IL mixtures are also covered. Finally, literature addressing the area of supramolecular catalysis \"by\" or \"in\" ILs is also reported.

In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Assuming CO2 solutions in the mouth stimulate only trigeminal nerve endings, this result is not altogether surprising; however, there are neurophysiological data indicating that CO2 stimulates gustatory as well as trigeminal fibers. In that case, carbonation might alter the quality profile of a stimulus without producing substantial changes in overall taste intensity--much as occurs when qualitatively different taste stimuli are mixed. To address this possibility, subjects were asked to rate the total taste intensity of moderate concentrations of stimuli representing each of the basic tastes and their binary combinations, with an without added carbonation. They then subdivided total taste intensity into the proportions of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness and 'other taste qualities' they perceived. The addition of carbonation produced only small increases in ratings of total taste intensity. However, rather dramatic alterations in the quality profiles of stimuli were observed, particularly for sweet and salty tastes. The nature of the interaction is consistent with a direct effect of carbonation/CO2 on the gustatory system, although the possibility that at least some of the observed effects reflect trigeminal-gustatory interactions cannot be ruled out.",

Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting.

The physicochemical characteristics of APA-22 HCl were studied at 25 degrees C by using equilibrium surface tension (gamma), solubilization of an oil-soluble dye, steady-state fluorescence, and chloride ion selective electrode techniques. The APA-22 HCl salt is considered to form an aggregate at a concentration, C(1), which is about twice the concentration of the solubility limit of APAs with shorter alkyl chains. At a higher concentration, C(2), the aggregates of APA-22 HCl start forming another kind of aggregate, which is able to solubilize oil-soluble materials. That is, C(1) is considered to represent the critical aggregation concentration (cac) and C(2) a morphology transition. In the concentration region between C(1) and C(2) the solutions are seemingly transparent whereas at above C(2) they appear bluish or translucent. Since the Krafft point of APA-22 HCl is 55 degrees C, all the solutions, including the aggregates, are thought to exist in metastable states.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers. The outcomes of these condensation reactions are rationalized with the different diamine structures and the relative orientation of cavitands in 1, 4, 5, and 9-14.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

While it is common knowledge that catalysts enhance reaction rates by lowering the activation energy it is often obscure how catalysts achieve this. This tutorial review explains some fundamental principles of catalysis and how the mechanisms are studied. The dissociation of formic acid into H2 and CO2 serves to demonstrate how a water molecule can open a new reaction path at lower energy, how immersion in liquid water can influence the charge distribution and energetics, and how catalysis at metal surfaces differs from that in the gas phase. The reversibility of catalytic reactions, the influence of an adsorption pre-equilibrium and the compensating effects of adsorption entropy and enthalpy on the Arrhenius parameters are discussed. It is shown that flexibility around the catalytic centre and residual substrate dynamics on the surface affect these parameters. Sabatier's principle of optimum substrate adsorption, shape selectivity in the pores of molecular sieves and the polarisation effect at the metal-support interface are explained. Finally, it is shown that the application of a bias voltage in electrochemistry offers an additional parameter to promote or inhibit a reaction. ",

Using well-described electrofuges, solvolysis rate constants were determined in mixtures containing different proportions of ethanol and the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide; the different solvent effects observed as the mixture changed could be explained using interactions of the ionic liquid with species along the reaction coordinate, determined using temperature dependent kinetic studies. The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome. Overall, this work quantitatively extends the understanding of solvent effects in ionic liquids and demonstrates the potential for such information to be used to rationally select an ionic liquid to control reaction outcome.",

Even though the cohesive energy density of D(2)O is larger than that of H(2)O, nonpolar compounds are slightly more soluble in D(2)O than H(2)O. In such case experimental data do not support the correctness of the large cohesive energy density as the ultimate cause of hydrophobicity.

Models are presented for both a two-liquid system (consisting of the amine solvent and water) and a three-liquid system (consisting of the amine solvent, water, and 1-octanol). Partitioning data with toluene as the third component is also shown for comparison with 1-octanol. ",

The general medium effect is given by gA gamma, where g is a curvature correction factor to the surface tension (gamma) and A is the molecular cavity surface area. A new feature is the definition of gamma to be that value appropriate to the equilibrium mean solvation shell composition. The solvation effect is modeled by stoichiometric stepwise competitive equilibria between the two solvent components for the solute. The intersolute effect includes the crystal energy and solution phase interactions. In this work, water was solvent component 1, and various miscible organic cosolvents served as solvent component 2. Relating all data to the fully aqueous solution gives an explicit expression for delta M delta G0, the solvent effect on the free energy change, as a function of the mole fractions x1 and x2. This function is a binding isotherm. Nonlinear regression leads (for a two-step solvation scheme) to estimates of the solvation exchange constants K1 and K2 and the parameter gA.

Disodium cromoglycate, or cromolyn, is an anti-allergy medicine representative of a class of compounds known as the chromonics. We have discovered that cromolyn's fluorescence is very sensitive to the polarity, hence structure, of the phase it exhibits. The fluorescence signal shifts its wavelength maximum and its shape depending on whether the cromolyn is a single phase or in coexisting phases. Since the signal due to individual phases can be identified, the fluorescence signal can reveal the temperature-induced transitions between single phase and phase coexistence regions. By studying such fluorescence data for different compositions, an isobaric temperature-composition phase diagram may be constructed. We present here a phase diagram derived from fluorescence studies that is in agreement with previous determinations using other techniques. Our results suggest that the binary phase diagrams of other intrinsically fluorescent chromonic materials, such as perylene monoimide and bisimide derivatives used in organic optoelectronic devices, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes, can be studied in water using an analogous fluorescence approach.

Simple equations are derived that allow calculation of cocrystal solubilization and transition point solubility. Analysis of 10 cocrystals in 6 different solubilizing agents shows that cocrystal solubilization is quantitatively predicted from drug solubilization. Drug solubilizing agents such as surfactants and lipid-based media are also shown to induce cocrystal transition points, where drug and cocrystal solubilities are equal, and above which the cocrystal solubility advantage over drug is eliminated. We have discovered that cocrystal solubility at the transition point (S*) is independent of solubilizing agent, and can be predicted from knowledge of only the aqueous solubilities of drug and cocrystal. For 1:1 cocrystals, S* = (Scocrystal,aq)(2)/Sdrug,aq. S* is a key indicator of cocrystal thermodynamic stability and establishes the upper solubility limit below which cocrystal is more soluble than the constituent drug.

By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity.

In the present work, vibration spectroscopy, calorimetric measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Raman and infrared spectra suggest that SA exists predominately as dimers in chloroform, but in the other five solvents there is no clear evidence of dimerization. In all solvents, the shift in the SA carbonyl peak reflecting the strength in the solvent-solute interaction is quite well correlated to the nucleation ranking. This shift is corroborated by DFT calculated energies of binding one solvent molecule to the carboxyl group of SA. An even better correlation of the influence of the solvent on the nucleation is provided by DFT calculated energy of binding the complete first solvation shell to the SA molecule. These solvation shell binding energies are corroborated by the enthalpy of solvent-solute interaction as estimated from experimentally determined enthalpy of solution and calculated enthalpy of cavity formation using the scaled particle theory. The different methods reveal a consistent picture and suggest that the stronger the solvent binds to the SA molecule in solution, the slower the nucleation becomes. ",

The polarised and depolarised spectra of the induced (ν2, ν3) modes of CS2 and of the ν1-2ν2 Fermi resonance dyad of both CO2 and CS2 have been measured. Upon dilution with CO2, the evolution of the spectroscopic observables of all these modes displays a \"plateau-like\" region in the CO2 mole fraction 0.3-0.7 never previously observed in CO2-organic liquids mixtures. The bandshape and intensity of the induced modes of CS2 are similar to those of pure CS2 up to equimolar concentration, after which variations occur. The preservation of the local ordering from pure CS2 to equimolar concentration together with the non-linear evolution of the spectroscopic observables allows inferring that two solvation regimes exist with a transition occurring in the plateau domain. In the first regime, corresponding to CS2 concentrated mixtures, the liquid phase is segregated with dominant CS2 clusters, whereas, in the second one, CO2 monomers and dimers and CO2-CS2 hetero-dimers coexist dynamically on a picosecond time-scale. It is demonstrated that the subtle interplay between attractive and repulsive interactions which provides a molecular interpretation of the non-ideality of the CO2-CS2 mixture allows rationalizing the volume expansion and the existence of the plateau-like region observed in the pressure-composition diagram previously ascribed to the proximity of an upper critical solution temperature at lower temperatures.

The specific solute-solvent interactions are described in terms of the electronic chemical potential for proton migration between the anion or cation and the transition state structure of a specific reaction. These indexes provide a quantitative estimation of the hydrogen bond (HB) acceptor basicity and the hydrogen bond donor acidity of the ionic solvent, respectively. A sound quantitative scale of HB strength is thereby obtained. The solvent dependent contributions are described by the global electrophilicity of the cation and nucleophilicity of the anion forming the ionic liquid. The model is illustrated for the kinetics of cycloaddition of cyclopentadiene towards acrolein. In general, cation HB acidity outweighs the remaining parameters for this reaction.",

This approach provides an a priori classification without requiring the knowledge of any experimental data. The theoretical descriptors of the proposed classification are generated through the analysis of the COSMO-RS σ-potential profiles. By applying a two-step statistical procedure to the descriptors generated for a set of 153 representative solvents, a clustering into 10 classes leads to an optimal classification that is compared to the classical Chastrette's classification. The investigation of nitrocellulose solubility allows a validation of the proposed classification, which can be extended also to solvent mixtures. This new approach for solvent classification, thus, appears as a consistent tool for the design of new solvents and their formulation.",

For the compounds containing the 4-(benzyloxy)phenyl group, solvent effects on the optical rotations have also been investigated in chloroform as solvent. Optical rotations have been obtained by time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) with the CAM-B3LYP functional and the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set at λ = 589 nm. Implicit and explicit solvent effects were investigated through the polarizable continuum model (PCM) and a microsolvation approach in conjunction with PCM, respectively. In the latter model, solvent molecules are considered as an explicit solvent and their positions are obtained by geometry optimizations for different conformers of the chiral molecule. For molecules containing the 1-naphthalene group, this model gives the same optical rotation signs for all conformers as compared to both gas phase and PCM results and reduces absolute deviations between calculations and experiment. Also, the microsolvation model reproduces the sign of the experimental optical rotations for the molecules containing the 4-(benzyloxy)phenyl group using both water and chloroform as solvent. In a microsolvation model, however, the water and chloroform solvent molecules have similar hydrogen bonds but different effects on the conformation and thereby on the optical rotation since one dihedral angle, having a large effect on the optical rotation, is strongly sensitive to hydrogen bonding to water but not to chloroform.

Theobromine solubility was studied in dioxane-water mixtures, a solvent system that was investigated earlier for the solubility of theophylline and caffeine. Solubilities were calculated in these polar systems by a regression method, based on an extension of the Hildebrand-Scatchard equation of regular solution theory. A linear relationship between the mixed solvent solubility parameter, and dielectric constant, epsilon, was introduced earlier and was confirmed in the present study. In addition, it was observed that a regression of log (activity coefficient) on epsilon in a second or higher degree polynomial provides reasonable solubility values for the methylxanthines in mixed solvents. A direct regression of molal or mole fraction (but not molar) solubility against delta 1, epsilon, or against volume percent of one or the other solvent in a binary solvent mixture provided a suitable measure of solubility for these crystalline drugs in mixed polar solvents. The drug's solubility parameter as determined from peak solubility in mixed polar solvents varied somewhat, depending on the specific solvent system employed. It is suggested that a drug may exhibit one (or more) solubility parameters in nonpolar solutions and multiple solubility parameters in polar systems.

The fingerprint region of IR spectra is often not considered in the analysis of hydrogen bonds as the effects are rather weak and often masked by other overlapping vibrational modes. For VCD spectra, however, the fingerprint region is the most important spectral range as it typically contains the strongest and most characteristic VCD patterns. As solute-solvent interactions might significantly alter the observed VCD spectral signatures, it is therefore important to understand which vibrational modes are affected by a hydrogen bond to the solvent and how this solute-solvent interaction is best modeled in the theoretical prediction of IR and VCD spectra. For this study, four structurally related primary and secondary chiral alcohols serve as model compounds for our investigations on the effect of solvation of the OH-group in dimethylsulfoxide-d6 and acetonitrile-d3 and of its self-aggregation in chloroform-d1. The analysis of the experimental and computational data allows us to provide first benchmarked guidelines for explicit consideration of solvent molecules in DFT-based spectra calculations of chiral alcohols.

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Convenient, chromatography-free isolation of these salts is achieved by precipitation, allowing the methodology to be applied directly to large scales.

The aromatic extraction ability of PyILs was greatly enhanced by the presence of a methyl group on the pyridinium ring at the 3- or 4-position, whereas the solubility of the aromatics in the PyILs decreased with increasing the number of methyl groups on the benzene ring. The FT-IR studies revealed that the solubility of an aromatic compound in a PyIL is closely correlated with the degree of aromatic C-H bending frequency shift observed during the dissolution of the aromatic compound in the PyIL: the larger the shift, the higher the solubility. The computational calculations on the dispersion interactions between aromatics and PyILs demonstrated that the anion-aromatic interaction is much more important than the cation-aromatic interaction in determining the aromatic solubility in PyILs, and such anion-aromatic interaction can be enhanced by introducing a methyl group at the carbon atom of the pyridinium ring.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

And the surfactant has been entrenched in so many areas of commerce for so many decades that its chemistry might seem old and tired. The purpose of this review is to persuade the reader otherwise, all the while focusing on a remarkable new surfactant, the gemini. Geminis, the common name for \"bis-surfactants\", can self-assemble at concentrations almost a hundredfold lower than for corresponding conventional surfactants. Surface activity can be improved a thousandfold. Geminis have already shown promise in skin care, antibacterial regimens, construction of high-porosity materials, analytical separations, and solubilization processes. Scores of patents dealing with geminis have appeared in the last few years. Indeed, geminis might well turn out, in the opinion of some, to be more useful to \"l'homme de la rue\" than crown ethers or fullerenes. This review delves into such topics as synthesis, critical micellization concentration, aggregate size and shape, gels, vesicles, and films. The information comes from scientists all over the world; one might say that gemini research is bathed in a continuous sunlight or summer.

Melting and boiling points as characteristic values emerge from this study as products of laboratory standardization, developed by chemists in their struggle to classify, understand and control organic nature. A major argument here concerns the role played by the introduction of organic synthesis in driving these changes. Synthetic organic chemistry vastly increased the number of known organic substances, precipitating the chemical identity crisis of my title. Successful natural product synthesis, moreover, depended on chemists' ability to demonstrate the absolute identity of synthetic product and natural target--something late nineteenth-century chemists eventually achieved by making reliable, replicable melting and boiling point measurements. In the period before the establishment of national standards laboratories, chemists and scientific glassblowers worked together to standardize melting and boiling points as physical constants, such collaborations highlighting the essential importance of chemical glassware and glassblowing skill in the development of nineteenth-century organic chemistry.",

Cress belongs to the botanical order Brassicales and produces glucosinolates, which are important precursors of nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds. Those compounds often present low perception thresholds and various olfactive notes and are thus of interest to the flavor and fragrance chemistry. When the study of organonitrogen and organosulfur compounds is undertaken, Brassicale extracts are one of the matrices of choice. Cress extracts were studied by analytical (GC-MS, GC-FPD) and chemical (fractionation) means to identify new interesting odorant compounds. Two compounds that have never been reported in cress extracts, containing both nitrogen and sulfur, were discovered: N-benzyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate and N-phenethyl O-ethyl thiocarbamate. These two molecules being of organoleptic interest, their homologues were synthesized and submitted to organoleptic tests (static and GC-sniffing). Their odors evolve from garlic and onion over green, mushroom- and cress-like to fresh, spearmint-like.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

We study this phenomenon for the C-C coupling reaction between nitromethane and benzaldehyde (the Henry reaction) with cinchona thiourea as the catalyst, where solvents that are strong Lewis bases induce a high ee. We show that the effect of the solvent does not consist of a change in the reaction mechanism. Instead, the solvation \"prepares\" the molecule, which is very flexible, in a specific conformation. The reaction barriers in this conformer are not lower than for other conformers, but are sufficiently differentiated between the enantiomers to give rise to a large ee. It is the strong Lewis basicity of the solvent that leads to the clear preference in solution for the \"asymmetric\" conformer. Although general rules or predictions for how solvent effects could be harnessed to produce a desired ee in general would be hard to formulate, this study does show that it is in this case (and presumably in many other cases as well) specific solute-solvent interactions rather than effects of the dielectric continuum of the solvent that are the root cause of the solvent effect.

A significant catalytic effect is observed with reference to the same reaction run in water, acetonitrile, and other conventional solvents.

We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium.

Evidence against nucleophilic solvent participation in the tert-butyl chloride transition state and for increased hydrogen bond donation to the 1-adamantyl chloride solvolysis transition state.\nDespite theoretical calculations to the contrary, it has been argued that the 1-adamantyl cation is more stable than the tert-butyl cation in media of high dielectric constant. This argument has been utilized to suggest that the higher rate of solvolysis of tert-butyl chloride in aqueous ethanol is evidence for nucleophilic solvent participation in this classic reaction. Further, in \"more highly ionizing\" solvents, the rate of 1-adamantyl chloride is nearly the same as that of tert-butyl chloride, which is interpreted as a manifestation of the relative stabilities of the cations. However, the evidence cited does not explain the increased sensitivity of the rate of solvolysis of 1-adamantyl chloride over tert-butyl chloride to solvents which are better able to donate hydrogen bonds. The hypothesis developed here is that 1-adamantyl chloride solvolysis is assisted by hydrogen bond donation departing chloride ion to a greater extent than that of tert-butyl chloride solvolysis, most likely due to lessened steric interactions in a developing pyramidal cation. This hypothesis is supported by multiparameter solvent effect factor analyses utilizing the KOMPH2 equation which, in addition, quantifies the important role of ground-state destabilization due to strong solvent-solvent interactions. An important result from the good correlation of free energies of transfer of the tert-butyl chloride solvolysis transition state is that there is no change in mechanism, and, in particular, no nucleophilic participation even in non-hydroxylic basic solvents. The equation is also applied to the case of dimethylsulfonium ion solvolyses where the tert-butyl salt reacts substantially faster than the 1-adamantyl salt in ethanol and the gas phase. The decreased rate of the former in hydrogen bond donating solvents relative to the gas phase is as yet unclear. Solvent N values that were generated to characterize solvent nucleophilicity are shown not to be correlated by measures of solvent basicity but rather by the negative of measures of solvent hydrogen bond donor ability.",

In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

In recent years, additional improvements to the construction of the sigma profiles and evaluation of activity coefficients have been made.

QSPR models for each scale were constructed using only theoretical descriptors. The high quality of the models is reflected by the squared multiple correlation coefficients that range from 0.726 to 0.999; only 18 models have R2&lt; 0.800. This enables direct theoretical calculation of predicted values for any scale and/or for any organic solvent, including those previously unmeasured. The molecular descriptors involved in the models are classified and discussed according to (i) the origin of their calculation (i.e., constitutional, geometric, charge-related, etc.) and (ii) the commonly accepted classification of physical interactions between the solute and solvent molecules in liquid (condensed) media. A reduced matrix 774 (solvents) x 100 (solvent scales) was selected for the principal component analysis (PCA) by taking into account only the solvent scales with more than 20 experimental data points. The first 5 principal components account for 75% of the total variance. The robustness of the PCA model obtained was validated by the comparison models development for restricted submatrices of data and with the results obtained for the full data set. The total variance accounted for by the first three PCs, for the submatrices with the same number of solvent scales but different numbers of solvents, varies from 68.2% to 59.0%. This demonstrates that the total variance described by the first 3 components is essentially stable as the number of solvents involved varies from 100 to 774. Subsequently, a matrix with 703 diverse solvents and 100 solvent scales was selected for the general classification of the solvents and scales according to the scores and loadings obtained from the PCA treatment. Classification of the theoretical molecular descriptors, derived from the chemical structure alone, according to their relevance to specific types of intermolecular interaction (cavity formation, electrostatic polarization, dispersion, and hydrogen bonding) in liquid media enables a more easily comprehensible physical interpretation of the QSPR of molecular properties in liquids and solutions. The reported QSPR models for solvent scales with theoretical molecular descriptors and the results of the PCA analysis are potentially of great practical importance, as they extend the applicability of correlations with empirical solvent scales to many previously unmeasured systems.",

The theoretical descriptors of the proposed classification are generated through the analysis of the COSMO-RS σ-potential profiles. By applying a two-step statistical procedure to the descriptors generated for a set of 153 representative solvents, a clustering into 10 classes leads to an optimal classification that is compared to the classical Chastrette's classification.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

That is, for the others we know what stimuli causes what response, and why and how. These fundamental questions are not answered within the sphere of smell science; we do not know what it is about a molecule that ... smells. I report, here, the status quo theories for olfaction, highlighting what we do not know, and explaining why dismissing the perception of the input as 'too subjective' acts as a roadblock not conducive to scientific inquiry. I outline the current and new theory that conjectures a mechanism for signal transduction based on quantum mechanical phenomena, dubbed the 'swipe card', which is perhaps controversial but feasible. I show that such lines of thinking may answer some questions, or at least pose the right questions. Most importantly, I draw links and comparisons as to how better understanding of how small (10's of atoms) molecules can interact so specially with large (10,000's of atoms) proteins in a way that is so integral to healthy living. Repercussions of this work are not just important in understanding a basic scientific tool used by us all, but often taken for granted, it is also a step closer to understanding generic mechanisms between drug and receptor, for example.",

This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion.",

Empirical studies and tools for the assessment of SM tendencies are particularly sparse. Our aim was to develop a comprehensive tool for the assessment of an individual's engagement in SM practices. A comprehensive 24-item checklist of different types of SM play was generated with the assistance of members of the German SM community, covering both a dominance scale and a submission scale. The sadomasochism checklist was administered in an online study to a sample of 652 adults (345 female, 307 male), with 527 participants being active members in the SM community. Both the frequency of SM behavior and the attraction to the types of SM practices were assessed. Results revealed a one-factor structure for the dominance as well as the submission scale. The distinction between different types of practices (soft play, domination/submission, beating, toys, breath and bodily fluids) was confirmed using principal component analysis. Cronbach's alpha was appropriate. The total scores for the dominance and the submission scale distinguish between participants with different preferences for dominant and submissive practices. The newly developed scale is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of the frequency of and attraction to SM behavior.

Physicochemical aspects.\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that homeopathic high dilutions (HDs) can effectively have a pharmacological action, and so cannot be considered merely placebos. However, until now there has been no unified explanation for these observations within the dominant paradigm of the dose-response effect. Here the possible scenarios for the physicochemical nature of HDs are reviewed. A number of theoretical and experimental approaches, including quantum physics, conductometric and spectroscopic measurements, thermoluminescence, and model simulations investigated the peculiar features of diluted/succussed solutions. The heterogeneous composition of water could be affected by interactive phenomena such as coherence, epitaxy and formation of colloidal nanobubbles containing gaseous inclusions of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, silica and, possibly, the original material of the remedy. It is likely that the molecules of active substance act as nucleation centres, amplifying the formation of supramolecular structures and imparting order to the solvent. Three major models for how this happens are currently being investigated: the water clusters or clathrates, the coherent domains postulated by quantum electrodynamics, and the formation of nanoparticles from the original solute plus solvent components. Other theoretical approaches based on quantum entanglement and on fractal-type self-organization of water clusters are more speculative and hypothetical. The problem of the physicochemical nature of HDs is still far from to be clarified but current evidence strongly supports the notion that the structuring of water and its solutes at the nanoscale can play a key role.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

During this event, and before the transition state for H transfer is reached, the system encounters a surface crossing, which provides pathways for unproductive back electron transfer and for productive reduction, with the latter involving attachment of the hydrogen to the carbon of CO2.

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

The dissociation of formic acid into H2 and CO2 serves to demonstrate how a water molecule can open a new reaction path at lower energy, how immersion in liquid water can influence the charge distribution and energetics, and how catalysis at metal surfaces differs from that in the gas phase. The reversibility of catalytic reactions, the influence of an adsorption pre-equilibrium and the compensating effects of adsorption entropy and enthalpy on the Arrhenius parameters are discussed. It is shown that flexibility around the catalytic centre and residual substrate dynamics on the surface affect these parameters. Sabatier's principle of optimum substrate adsorption, shape selectivity in the pores of molecular sieves and the polarisation effect at the metal-support interface are explained.

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts.

Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed.

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers.

Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude.

According to this concept, the conventional organic solvent medium used in catalytic chemical reactions is replaced substantially (up to 80 vol %) by CO(2), at moderate pressures (tens of bars), to create a continuum of CO(2)-expanded solvent media. A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

The reactivity of Ox(-) and p-ClPhO(-) increases significantly as the DMSO content in the medium increases, although the effects of medium on reactivity are not the same for the reactions with Ox(-) and p-ClPhO(-). Ox(-) exhibits the α-effect in all solvent compositions and temperatures. The α-effect increases up to 50 mol % DMSO and then decreases thereafter, resulting in a bell-shaped α-effect profile. Dissection of the activation parameters (i.e., ΔH(‡) and TΔS(‡)) has revealed that the bell-shaped α-effect behavior is due to entropy of activation differences rather than enthalpy terms, although the enthalpy term controls almost entirely the solvent dependence of the reaction rate. Differences in the transition-state (TS) structures for the reactions with Ox(-) (a six-membered cyclic TS) and p-ClPhO(-) (an acyclic TS) are consistent with the entropy-dependent α-effect behavior.",

The density of the mixed solvents at different pressures was also determined and the isothermal compressibility was calculated using the density data. The activation volume of the reaction was calculated based on the dependence of rate constant (kc) on pressure. It was demonstrated that the kc was very sensitive to the pressure in the mixed solvents near the critical region and the kc increased dramatically as pressure approached dew points, critical point, and bubble points of the mixed solvents. However, the kc in the mixed solvents outside the critical region or in pure CO2 was not sensitive to pressure. At suitable conditions, kc could be 40 times larger than that in acetonitrile. The activation volume of the reaction was nearly independent of pressure as the pressure was much higher than the phase separation pressure of the mixed solvents, while it increased considerably as pressure approached the bubble points, critical point, and dew points from high pressure. The clustering of the solvent molecules with the reactants and the activated complex in the reaction systems near the phase boundary in the critical region may be the main reason for the interesting phenomena observed. This work also shows that, using pure CO2 as the solvent, the reaction cannot be carried out in the critical region of the solvent due to the limitations of the reactants, while it can be conducted in the critical region of mixed solvents of suitable compositions, where the solvents are highly compressible and the reaction rate can be tuned effectively by pressure.",

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water.

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome.

These days, ionic liquids can be considered as a mature class of compounds for many different applications. Frequently, they are used as neoteric solvents for chemical tansformations, and the number of reviews on this field of research is huge. In this focused review, though, we are trying to evaluate the state of the art of ionic liquid chemistry beyond using them simply as solvents for chemical transformations. It is not meant to be a comprehensive overview on the topic; the choice of emphasis and examples rather refects the authors' personal view on the field. We are especially highlighting fields in which we believe the most fundamental developments within the next five years will take place: biomass processing, (chiral) ionic liquids from natural sources, biotransformations, and organic synthesis.

Unfortunately, organic solvents make up most of the organic waste created by the chemical enterprise, whether from academic, industrial, or governmental labs. One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water. The resulting micellar arrays serve as nanoreactors, obviating organic solvents as the reaction medium, while maximizing environmental benefits.",

Many of them have attracted considerable attention and haave been applied in distinct fields of chemistry.

According to this concept, the conventional organic solvent medium used in catalytic chemical reactions is replaced substantially (up to 80 vol %) by CO(2), at moderate pressures (tens of bars), to create a continuum of CO(2)-expanded solvent media. A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules.

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers.

Several unique features of HFIP compared to its non-fluoro analogue isopropanol have helped this solvent to make a difference in various subdomains of organic chemistry. One such area is transition metal-catalyzed C-H bond functionalization reactions. While, on one side, HFIP is emerging as a green and sustainable deep eutectic solvent (DES), on the other side, a major proportion of Pd-catalyzed C-H functionalization is heavily relying on this solvent. In particular, for distal aromatic C-H functionalizations, the exceptional impact of HFIP to elevate the yield and selectivity has made this solvent irreplaceable. Recent research studies have also highlighted the H-bond-donating ability of HFIP to enhance the chiral induction in Pd-catalyzed atroposelective C-H activation. This perspective aims to portray different shades of HFIP as a magical solvent in Pd-catalyzed C-H functionalization reactions.",

The regioselectivity of cyclopropane ring-opening as well as product distributions were found to be highly dependent on the nature of the solvent. In alcohols, dimeric substances arising from external bond cleavage are major products. Radical rearrangement products are also formed in solvents such as ether and ethyl acetate. On the contrary, nucleophile addition to carbocation intermediates, generated by internal bond cleavage, occurs mainly in reactions taking place in acetonitrile. It is proposed that the observed solvent effects that govern the reaction pathways followed are a consequence of varying solvation of copper intermediates, which governs their reactivity and redox properties. In addition, the influence of counteranions of the copper salts, organonitriles, cyclic dienes, and substrate structures on the pathways followed in these reactions was also examined. ",

C-H cleavage is favored in polar solvents, whereas C-C cleavage is favored in nonpolar solvents. This variation is attributed to the differential solvation of the transition states, which was further supported through the use of sterically bulky solvents and weakly coordinating solvents. Variation of the temperature of reaction of [(dippe)NiH]2 with 2M3BN in decane and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) allowed for the calculation of Eyring activation parameters for the C-CN activation and C-H activation mechanisms. The activation parameters for the C-H activation pathway were DeltaH(double dagger) = 11.4 +/- 5.3 kcal/mol and DeltaS(double dagger) = -45 +/- 15 e.u., compared with DeltaH(double dagger) = 17.3 +/- 2.6 kcal/mol and DeltaS(double dagger) = -29 +/- 7 e.u. for the C-CN activation pathway.

The density of the mixed solvents at different pressures was also determined and the isothermal compressibility was calculated using the density data. The activation volume of the reaction was calculated based on the dependence of rate constant (kc) on pressure. It was demonstrated that the kc was very sensitive to the pressure in the mixed solvents near the critical region and the kc increased dramatically as pressure approached dew points, critical point, and bubble points of the mixed solvents. However, the kc in the mixed solvents outside the critical region or in pure CO2 was not sensitive to pressure. At suitable conditions, kc could be 40 times larger than that in acetonitrile. The activation volume of the reaction was nearly independent of pressure as the pressure was much higher than the phase separation pressure of the mixed solvents, while it increased considerably as pressure approached the bubble points, critical point, and dew points from high pressure. The clustering of the solvent molecules with the reactants and the activated complex in the reaction systems near the phase boundary in the critical region may be the main reason for the interesting phenomena observed. This work also shows that, using pure CO2 as the solvent, the reaction cannot be carried out in the critical region of the solvent due to the limitations of the reactants, while it can be conducted in the critical region of mixed solvents of suitable compositions, where the solvents are highly compressible and the reaction rate can be tuned effectively by pressure.",

Geminis, the common name for \"bis-surfactants\", can self-assemble at concentrations almost a hundredfold lower than for corresponding conventional surfactants. Surface activity can be improved a thousandfold. Geminis have already shown promise in skin care, antibacterial regimens, construction of high-porosity materials, analytical separations, and solubilization processes. Scores of patents dealing with geminis have appeared in the last few years. Indeed, geminis might well turn out, in the opinion of some, to be more useful to \"l'homme de la rue\" than crown ethers or fullerenes. This review delves into such topics as synthesis, critical micellization concentration, aggregate size and shape, gels, vesicles, and films. The information comes from scientists all over the world; one might say that gemini research is bathed in a continuous sunlight or summer.

The process of self-assembly, in molecular gels, is intricate and must balance parameters influencing solubility and those contrasting forces that govern epitaxial growth into axially symmetric elongated aggregates. Although the gelator-gelator interactions are of paramount importance in understanding gelation, the solvent-gelator specific (i.e., H-bonding) and nonspecific (dipole-dipole, dipole-induced and instantaneous dipole induced forces) intermolecular interactions are equally important. Solvent properties mediate the self-assembly of molecular gelators into their self-assembled fibrillar networks. Herein, solubility parameters of solvents, ranging from partition coefficients (log P), to Henry's law constants (HLC), to solvatochromic parameters (ET(30)), and Kamlet-Taft parameters (β, α and π), and to Hansen solubility parameters (δp, δd, δh), are correlated with the gelation ability of numerous classes of molecular gelators. Advanced solvent clustering techniques have led to the development of a priori tools that can identify the solvents that will be gelled and not gelled by molecular gelators. These tools will greatly aid in the development of novel gelators without solely relying on serendipitous discoveries. These tools illustrate that the quest for the universal gelator should be left in the hands of Don Quixote and as researchers we must focus on identifying gelators capable of gelling classes of solvents as there is likely no one gelator capable of gelling all solvents.

A combinatorial library comprising of 16 salts, derived from 5 L-amino acid methyl esters and 4 cinnamic acid derivatives, has been prepared and scanned for gelation. Remarkably, 14 out of 16 salts prepared (87.5 % of the salts) show moderate to good gelation abilities with various solvents, including commercial fuels, such as petrol. Anti-solvent induced instant gelation at room temperature has been achieved in all the gelator salts, indicating that the gelation process is indeed an aborted crystallization phenomenon. Rheology, optical and scanning electron microscopy, small angle neutron scattering, and X-ray powder diffraction have been used to characterize the gels. A structure-property correlation has been attempted, based on these data, in addition to the single-crystal structures of 5 gelator salts. Analysis of the FT-IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy data reveals that some of these salts can be used as supramolecular containers for the slow release of certain pest sex pheromones.

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In 1908, Callendar showed that water hydrated to the solute can explain some of the departures from Raoult's law in aqueous solution. Here, we show that by simply assuming equilibria between the free water in solution and its hydrated forms, Raoult's law and Callendar's extension are valid over the full range of concentrations, while also showing how water and solutes interact in solution.

The proposed methodology departs from the traditional single-parameter procedures for estimating nonspecific solvent effects by splitting them into a polarizability term and a dipolarity term. In this work, we examined the SA, SB, SP, and SdP values for 160 solvents, the gas phase (the absence of solvent) being the origin of these scales. As shown in this paper, this information allows one not only to accurately describe the solvent effect experienced by any solute whether polar or nonpolar and exhibiting some or no specific interaction with the solvent but also to understand the nature of the well-known solvent parameters E(T)(30), pi, S', and SPP, which are frequently used to describe the overall nonspecific contribution of solvents in terms of a single parameter. The high potential of the proposed empirical methodology is illustrated with its application to the solvatochromic analysis of the spectroscopic behavior of molecular chromophores, thus explaining, for example, the influence of solvent effects in the twist intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), or LASER (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) emissions. Also, this methodology is applied to understanding for the indole chromophore the feasible inversion of the electronic nature for the first electronic excited state due to solvent effects.",

The dramatic increase in viscosity in highly concentrated solutions is a long-standing unsolved problem in physical chemistry. Here we will show that this viscosity increase can be understood in terms of the solute-induced structuring of the first solvation shell, leading to a jamming transition at a critical concentration. As the jamming transition is approached, the viscosity naturally increases according to a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann type expression. This result calls into question the validity of the Jones-Dole B-coefficient as an indicator of the structure making or breaking ability of solutes.",

Results in these solvents are compared to the ion-specific bubble coalescence inhibition observed in aqueous electrolyte solutions, which is predicted by simple, empirical ion combining rules. Coalescence inhibition by electrolytes is observed in all solvents, at a lower concentration range (0.01 M to 0.1M) to that observed in water. Formamide shows ion-specific salt effects dependent upon ion combinations in a way analogous to the combining rules observed in water. Bubble coalescence in propylene carbonate is also consistent with ion-combining rules, but the ion assignments differ to those for water. In both methanol and DMSO all salts used are found to inhibit bubble coalescence. Our results show that electrolytes influence bubble coalescence in a rich and complex way, but with notable similarities across all solvents tested. Coalescence is influenced by the drainage of fluid between two bubbles to form a film and then the rupture of the film and one might expect that these processes will vary dramatically between solvents. The similarities in behavior we observe show that coalescence inhibition is unlikely to be related to the surface forces present but is perhaps related to the dynamic thinning and rupture of the liquid film through the hydrodynamic boundary condition.",

Yet hitherto, a majority of accurate spectrophotometric measurements of transparent solvents upon visible light radiation often end up using long-path-length cells, usually over dozens of cm, rendering the measure costly and complex; meanwhile, the guidance for choosing the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation or its variants as the best formula to predict the light scattering in solvents has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate a simple, versatile and cost-effective spectrophotometric method, enabling a sensitivity of 10-4 dB cm-1 over a 0.5 cm differential path length based on using standard double-beam spectrophotometer. We prove that this method reduces the path length by a factor of 100 while still making its closest approach to the record-low measurement of solvent extinction. We also validate that all the present equations used for predicting the light scattering in the solvent possess similar capacities, suggesting that the criterion for the choice of the appropriate formula simply depends on the equation's practicability. Following the elucidation of the wavelength range where the light scattering dominates the extinction, we further identify differences between scattering coefficients via the theoretical predictions and experimental measures, exposing the need for an improved theory to account for the solvent scattering phenomenon.",

The authors measured the Raman spectra of CS2 mixed with THF at different volume fractions. According to the J. F. Bertran theory, we analyzed the changing regularity of v1-2v2 Fermi resonance along with the different concentration. It was shown that the characteristic parameters of Fermi resonance in solution, such as spectra intensity, frequency space, coupling coefficient and anharmonic constant, will make changes along with solution concentration variation. Because of the existing of solvent effects, the spectra intensity decreases gradually, and the coupling coefficient increases gradually. The explanation of such changes is that the vibration spectra are affected not only by scattering coefficient, but also by more weak hydrogen bond's formation. In addition, the asymmetric frequency shift of the Raman spectra was also found in the paper. The fundamental frequency v1 basically has no shifts, but the overtone frequency 2v2 moves towards the high wave number gradually, which is inconsistent with the theory of symmetrical movement. According to the study of molecular microcosmic action, the formation and mechanism of the weak hydrogen bond can preferably explain the above phenomenon. The research has a major influence on the further study of solvent effects in Fermi resonance. And the paper will also provide certain reference value for the study of molecule vibration spectra in solution.",

The essence of the approach is the development of a new criterion called \"effectivity\". The latter is based on consequences of the Brønsted and Izmailov acid-base theories and represents a quantitative measure for improving or worsening the titration conditions of acids and bases in non-aqueous solvents as compared with water. The \"effectivity\" E is given by the relation E = DeltapK(s) - DeltapK(s) where DeltapK(s) is the difference between the logarithmic values of the autoprotolysis constants of water and the solvent in question, and DeltapK is the so-called medium effect. The latter is a constant value which shows that acids and bases with the same charge alter their strength to the same extent when transferred from water into a non-aqueous solvent. The medium effect is calculated by statistical treatment of a great number of acid-base constants determined experimentally both in water and the non-aqueous solvent in question. The effectivity of the solvents most often used in non-aqueous acid-base titrimetry, determined by this approach, shows that in many cases these solvents offer significant advantages over water, but drawbacks are also observed. Some limitations of the approach are discussed. Special attention is paid to dimethylsulphoxide and its mixtures with water, which prove to be highly effective media for the acid-base titration of many substances.",

What's <i>your</i> E Factor?\nTraditional organic chemistry, and organic synthesis in particular, relies heavily on organic solvents, as most reactions involve organic substrates and catalysts that tend to be water-insoluble. Unfortunately, organic solvents make up most of the organic waste created by the chemical enterprise, whether from academic, industrial, or governmental labs. One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water. The resulting micellar arrays serve as nanoreactors, obviating organic solvents as the reaction medium, while maximizing environmental benefits.",

DESs are prepared by the simple mixing of two or three cheap constituents (that are capable of self-association) with gentle heating, which leads to a drastic decrease in their melting points. The resultant clear homogeneous mixture consists of cations, anions, as well as neutral molecules; this will contribute both ionic and molecular solvent properties to the DESs. DESs have emerged as alternatives to conventional organic solvents and ILs, which meet different criteria such as availability, low cost, low toxicity, biodegradability, recyclability, ease of preparation method, tunable, and designer physiochemical properties. Many of them have attracted considerable attention and haave been applied in distinct fields of chemistry. To summarize the full-scale development of DESs, this review discusses the history, classifications, various methods of preparation, properties, and some major applications in catalysis in the last three years. This review is expected to be helpful for the further development of DESs based on a summary of the fundamental research in the field.",

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers. The outcomes of these condensation reactions are rationalized with the different diamine structures and the relative orientation of cavitands in 1, 4, 5, and 9-14.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

The solvolysis data allowed determination of the nucleofugality of chloride in these mixtures, which varied with the proportion of salt in the reaction mixture, demonstrating quantitatively the importance of the amount of ionic liquid in the reaction mixture in determining reaction outcome. Nucleofugality data for chloride were determined in seven further ionic liquids, with the reactivity shown to vary over more than an order of magnitude. This outcome illustrates that the components of the ionic liquid are critical in determining reaction outcome. Overall, this work quantitatively extends the understanding of solvent effects in ionic liquids and demonstrates the potential for such information to be used to rationally select an ionic liquid to control reaction outcome.",

One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

To address this challenge, a systematic methodology is proposed that quickly identifies improved reaction solvents by combining quantum mechanical computations of the reaction rate constant in a few solvents with a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) procedure. The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction. The results were validated successfully by in situ kinetic experiments. A space of 1,341 solvents was explored in silico, but required quantum-mechanical calculations of the rate constant in only nine solvents, and uncovered a solvent that increases the rate constant by 40%.

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality.

A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium.

Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers.

For the substrates in which the demand for solvation of the leaving groups moiety is reduced, (e.g., carbonates) s(f) parameters decrease as the fraction of the water in a given solvent/water mixture increases (log k vs. E(f) plots converge), due to decreasing solvation of the electrofuge moiety toward bigger electrofugality. The abscissa of the intersection of the converging plots might indicate the critical electrofugality above which the solvolysis rates should not depend of the water fraction. Larger reaction constant s(f) indicate later transition state for structurally related substrates only, while s(f) parameters for structurally different substrates cannot be compared likely due to different intrinsic barriers.

According to this concept, the conventional organic solvent medium used in catalytic chemical reactions is replaced substantially (up to 80 vol %) by CO(2), at moderate pressures (tens of bars), to create a continuum of CO(2)-expanded solvent media. A particular benefit is found for oxidation catalysis; the presence of CO(2) in the mixed medium increases the O(2) solubility by ca. 100 times compared to that in the neat organic solvent while the retained organic solvent serves an essential role by solubilizing the transition metal catalyst. We show that CO(2)-expanded solvents provide optimal properties for maximizing oxidation rates that are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than those obtained with either the neat organic solvent or supercritical CO(2) as the reaction medium. These advantages are demonstrated with examples of homogeneous oxidations of a substituted phenol and of cyclohexene by molecular O(2) using transition metal catalysts, cobalt Schiff-base and iron porphyrin complexes, respectively, in CO(2)-expanded CH(3)CN.",

Earlier, it was found that the trifluoroacetic acid-catalyzed condensation of 2 and 2 equiv of 3 in CHCl(3) provides in 82% yield an octahedral nanocage 1 composed of 6 cavitands that are linked together by 12 -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linker groups (Liu, X.; Liu, Y.; Li, G.; Warmuth, R. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 901). In tetrahydrofuran, the same reactants yield a tetrameric nanocage 4 (35% yield), which resembles a distorted tetrahedron built up from four cavitands that occupy the apexes. Each cavitand is doubly linked to one other cavitand and singly linked to the other two cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)N=CH- connectors. In CH(2)Cl(2), the reaction between 8 2 and 16 3 yields a square antiprismatic nanocage 5 (65% yield), in which each cavitand occupies one of the eight corners and is connected to four neighboring cavitands via -CH=N-CH(2)CH(2)-N=CH- linkers. Nanocage 5 is also the main product in CH(2)ClCH(2)Cl (26% yield) and CHCl(2)CHCl(2) (33% yield). Reduction of all imine bonds in 4 and 5 yields polyaminonanocontainers 7 and 8, respectively, which were isolated as trifluoroacetate salts. Contrary to the formation of larger capsules composed of four, six, or eight cavitands in the reaction between 2 and 3, the acid-catalyzed reaction of 2 with 2 equiv of H(2)N-X-NH(2) (X = (CH(2))(n)(=3,4,5), 1,3-C(6)H(4), 1,4-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4), or 1,3-(CH(2))(2)C(6)H(4)) quantitatively yields octaiminohemicarcerands 9-14, in which two cavitands are connected with four -CH=N-X-N=CH- linkers. The outcomes of these condensation reactions are rationalized with the different diamine structures and the relative orientation of cavitands in 1, 4, 5, and 9-14.",

The approach allows the identification of a high-performance solvent within a very large set of possible molecules. The validity of our CAMD approach is demonstrated through application to a classical nucleophilic substitution reaction for the study of solvent effects, the Menschutkin reaction.

Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst-solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, Cp<supX</sup M<supIII</sup (M=Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*Rh<supIII</sup catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent-induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (e. g., replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products.

Unfortunately, organic solvents make up most of the organic waste created by the chemical enterprise, whether from academic, industrial, or governmental labs. One alternative to organic solvents follows the lead of Nature: water. To circumvent the solubility issues, newly engineered \"designer\" surfactants offer an opportunity to efficiently enable many of the commonly used transition metal-catalyzed and related reactions in organic synthesis to be run in water, and usually at ambient temperatures. This review focuses on recent progress in this area, where such amphiphiles spontaneously self-aggregate in water. The resulting micellar arrays serve as nanoreactors, obviating organic solvents as the reaction medium, while maximizing environmental benefits.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

A third Guareschi reaction, the so-called \"Guareschi 1897 reaction\", is one of the most unusual reactions in organic chemistry, involving the radical-mediated paradoxical aerobic generation of hydrocarbons in near-neutral water solution. A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

That conclusion is here affirmed as general for any protic solvent, and it is further concluded that those calculations are flawed.",

This idea has resulted from the concept that most molecular solvents are homogeneous. In a deep eutectic solvent (DES), however, both components can be ionic or non-ionic, polar or non-polar. By tuning the components, DESs can solubilize a wide variety of solutes, often mixing hydrophobic and hydrophilic components, and the mixture can be designed to control phase behavior. The liquids often contain significant short-length order, and preferential solvation of one component often occurs. The addition of small polar molecules such as water or alcohols results in non-homogeneous liquids, which have significantly decreased viscosity and increased ionic conductivity.

Am. Chem. Soc.</i <b2010</b, <i132</i, 4328). Our density functional theory (DFT)-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations of the crystals evidence the crucial role of specific asymmetric anion positioning on the lowering of the symmetry. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations prove the ion pair association in nonpolar solvents. Time-dependent DFT vibronic calculations in toluene show that ion pairing indeed stabilizes an asymmetric dipolar structure in the electronic ground state. This largely broadens the absorption spectrum in very reasonable agreement with experiment, while the principal pattern of vibrational modes is retained. The current findings allow us to establish a unified picture of the symmetry breaking of polymethine dyes in fluid solution.",

High-level CCSD(T)/CBS//M06-2X/6-31+G(d) gas phase energies were combined with solvation free energies from SMD, SM12, and ADF-COSMO-RS continuum solvent models, as well as molecular mechanics (MM) explicit solvent models with different atomic charge schemes to predict the rate constants of three S<subN</sub2 reactions in eight protic and aprotic solvents. It is revealed that the prediction of rate constants in organic solvents is not necessarily less challenging than in water and popular solvent models struggle to predict their rate constants to within 3 log units of experimental values. Among the continuum solvent models, the ADF-COSMO-RS model performed the best in predicting absolute rate contants while the SM12 model was best at predicting relative rate constants with an average accuracy of about 1.5 and 0.8 log units, respectively. The use of computationally more demanding MM explicit solvent models did not translate to improvements in absolute rate constants but was quite effective at predicting relative rate constants due to systematic error cancellation. Free energy barriers obtained from umbrella sampling with explicit solvent QM/MM simulations led to excellent agreement with experimental values, provided that a validated level of theory is used to treat the QM region.",

The proposed methodology departs from the traditional single-parameter procedures for estimating nonspecific solvent effects by splitting them into a polarizability term and a dipolarity term. In this work, we examined the SA, SB, SP, and SdP values for 160 solvents, the gas phase (the absence of solvent) being the origin of these scales. As shown in this paper, this information allows one not only to accurately describe the solvent effect experienced by any solute whether polar or nonpolar and exhibiting some or no specific interaction with the solvent but also to understand the nature of the well-known solvent parameters E(T)(30), pi, S', and SPP, which are frequently used to describe the overall nonspecific contribution of solvents in terms of a single parameter. The high potential of the proposed empirical methodology is illustrated with its application to the solvatochromic analysis of the spectroscopic behavior of molecular chromophores, thus explaining, for example, the influence of solvent effects in the twist intramolecular charge transfer (TICT), the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), or LASER (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) emissions. Also, this methodology is applied to understanding for the indole chromophore the feasible inversion of the electronic nature for the first electronic excited state due to solvent effects.",

The ionic mechanism is the one found in most organic chemistry textbooks; it begins with the protonation of the ketone by the acid catalyst, even though this reaction normally takes place in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane. Our calculations show that the concerted non-ionic pathway, which is the least energetic in non-polar solvents such as dichloromethane, becomes more energetic the more polar the solvent. After investigating a variety of non-ionic and ionic pathways in water, it is found that the addition step seems to be ionic but the migration step, which is rate-determining, is uncatalyzed, non-ionic and fully concerted. These results confirm the experimental findings in solvents of low to medium polarity that the rate constant of the reaction decreases as the solvent polarity increases.
