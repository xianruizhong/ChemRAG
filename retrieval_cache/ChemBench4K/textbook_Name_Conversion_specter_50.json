A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world's population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy.

Hydrocarbons\n21.2 Alcohols and Ethers\n21.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters\n21.4 Amines and Amides\n\nINTRODUCTION All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds. The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet \"carbon-based\" life. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although a single, precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms.\n\nToday, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter, we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those compounds are classified, and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings.",

(b) Attraction between the $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ ions is stronger than between the ions and water molecules (the ion-ion interactions have a lower, more negative energy). Therefore, the dissolution process increases the energy of the molecular interactions, and it consumes the thermal energy of the solution to make up for the difference.

Heat is released when the total intermolecular forces (IMFs) between the solute and solvent molecules are stronger than the total IMFs in the pure solute and in the pure solvent: Breaking weaker IMFs and forming stronger IMFs releases heat. Heat is absorbed when the total IMFs in the solution are weaker than the total of those in the pure solute and in the pure solvent: Breaking stronger IMFs and forming weaker IMFs absorbs heat.\n5. Crystals of NaCl dissolve in water, a polar liquid with a very large dipole moment, and the individual ions become strongly solvated.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms.

Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

Part of the problem is due to the sheer complexity of organic structures, but part is also due to the fact that chemical names have more than one purpose. For the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), which catalogs and indexes the worldwide chemical literature, each compound must have only one correct name. It would be chaos if half the entries for $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ were indexed under \" M \" for methyl bromide and half under \"B\" for bromomethane. Furthermore, a CAS name must be strictly systematic so that it can be assigned and interpreted by computers; common names are not allowed.\n\nPeople, however, have different requirements than computers. For people-which is to say students and professional chemists in their spoken and written communications-it's best that a chemical name be pronounceable and as easy as possible to assign and interpret. Furthermore, it's convenient if names follow historical precedents, even if that means a particularly well-known compound might have more than one name. People can readily understand that bromomethane and methyl bromide both refer to $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$.\n\nAs noted in the text, chemists overwhelmingly use the nomenclature system devised and maintained by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, or IUPAC.

When the substituents have been identified, the parent chain has been numbered, and the proper multipliers such as di- and tri- have been assigned, the name is written with the substituents listed in alphabetical, rather than numerical, order. Multipliers such as di- and tri- are not used for\nalphabetization, but the italicized prefixes iso- and sec- are used.\n\n2. 5-Amino-3-methyl-2-pentanol\n3. Use of hyphens; single- and multiple-word names. The general rule is to determine whether the parent is itself an element or compound. If it is, then the name is written as a single word; if it isn't, then the name is written as multiple words. Methylbenzene is written as one word, for instance, because the parent-benzene-is a compound. Diethyl ether, however, is written as two words because the parent-ether-is a class name rather than a compound name. Some further examples follow:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Mg}-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\n$$\n\n14. Dimethylmagnesium (one word, because magnesium is an element)\n\n15. 4-(Dimethylamino)pyridine (one word, because pyridine is a compound)\n\n16. Isopropyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (two words, because \"propanoate\" is not a compound)\n\n17. Methyl cyclopentanecarbothioate (two words, because \"cyclopentanecarbothioate\" is not a compound)\n18. Parentheses. Parentheses are used to denote complex substituents when ambiguity would otherwise arise. For example, chloromethylbenzene has two substituents on a benzene ring, but (chloromethyl)benzene has only one complex substituent.

These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior.\n\nMacro is a Greek word that means \"large.\" The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties such as density, solubility, and flammability.\n\nMicro comes from Greek and means \"small.\" The microscopic domain of chemistry is often visited in the imagination. Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for example, many biological cells. More sophisticated instruments are capable of imaging even smaller entities such as molecules and atoms (see Figure 1.5 (b)).\n\nHowever, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the most advanced microscopes and may only be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic\ndomain include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see.\n\nThe symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs, drawings, and calculations. These symbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Part of the problem is due to the sheer complexity of organic structures, but part is also due to the fact that chemical names have more than one purpose.

It would be chaos if half the entries for $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ were indexed under \" M \" for methyl bromide and half under \"B\" for bromomethane. Furthermore, a CAS name must be strictly systematic so that it can be assigned and interpreted by computers; common names are not allowed.\n\nPeople, however, have different requirements than computers. For people-which is to say students and professional chemists in their spoken and written communications-it's best that a chemical name be pronounceable and as easy as possible to assign and interpret.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

These domains provide different ways of considering and describing chemical behavior.\n\nMacro is a Greek word that means \"large.\" The macroscopic domain is familiar to us: It is the realm of everyday things that are large enough to be sensed directly by human sight or touch. In daily life, this includes the food you eat and the breeze you feel on your face. The macroscopic domain includes everyday and laboratory chemistry, where we observe and measure physical and chemical properties such as density, solubility, and flammability.\n\nMicro comes from Greek and means \"small.\" The microscopic domain of chemistry is often visited in the imagination. Some aspects of the microscopic domain are visible through standard optical microscopes, for example, many biological cells. More sophisticated instruments are capable of imaging even smaller entities such as molecules and atoms (see Figure 1.5 (b)).\n\nHowever, most of the subjects in the microscopic domain of chemistry are too small to be seen even with the most advanced microscopes and may only be pictured in the mind. Other components of the microscopic\ndomain include ions and electrons, protons and neutrons, and chemical bonds, each of which is far too small to see.\n\nThe symbolic domain contains the specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains. Chemical symbols (such as those used in the periodic table), chemical formulas, and chemical equations are part of the symbolic domain, as are graphs, drawings, and calculations. These symbols play an important role in chemistry because they help interpret the behavior of the macroscopic domain in terms of the components of the microscopic domain. One of the challenges for students learning chemistry is recognizing that the same symbols can represent different things in the macroscopic and microscopic domains, and one of the features that makes chemistry fascinating is the use of a domain that must be imagined to explain behavior in a domain that can be observed.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes - \nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:\n\n1. To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 21.1.\n2. Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.\n\npropane\n\n\n2-chloropropane\n\n\n2-methylpropane\n\n\n2,4-difluorohexane\n\n\n1-bromo-3-chlorohexane\n\nWhen more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di-(two), tri- (three), tetra-(four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents).",

Answer: - \nTABLE 3.4\n\nNote that there is a system for naming some polyatomic ions; -ate and -ite are suffixes designating polyatomic ions containing more or fewer oxygen atoms. Per- (short for \"hyper\") and hypo- (meaning \"under\") are prefixes meaning more oxygen atoms than -ate and fewer oxygen atoms than -ite, respectively. For example, perchlorate is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{4}^{-}$, chlorate is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{3}{ }^{-}$, chlorite is $\\mathrm{ClO}_{2}{ }^{-}$and hypochlorite is $\\mathrm{ClO}^{-}$. Unfortunately, the number of oxygen atoms corresponding to a given suffix or prefix is not consistent; for example, nitrate is $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$while sulfate is $\\mathrm{SO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$. This will be covered in more detail later in the module on nomenclature.\n\nThe nature of the attractive forces that hold atoms or ions together within a compound is the basis for classifying chemical bonding. When electrons are transferred and ions form, ionic bonds result. Ionic bonds are electrostatic forces of attraction, that is, the attractive forces experienced between objects of opposite electrical charge (in this case, cations and anions). When electrons are \"shared\" and molecules form, covalent bonds result. Covalent bonds are the attractive forces between the positively charged nuclei of the bonded atoms and one or more pairs of electrons that are located between the atoms. Compounds are classified as ionic or molecular (covalent) on the basis of the bonds present in them.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

The atoms that make up the element combine in various ways, ranging from the mostly ionic ( NaCl ) to the partially ionic ( HCl ) to what we will call purely covalent. At the most fundamental level, all chemical bonds involve electrons, and a significant percentage of chemical and physical properties can be explained by considering the location and separation of charge in a species. By understanding the structure of matter at the atomic level, we can begin to build an understanding of the behavior of matter at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels.\n\nAn understanding of dipoles and partial ionic character is fundamental to understanding the interactions between particles, which we will examine in the chapter on liquids and solids.

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

Determination of Empirical Formulas - \nAs previously mentioned, the most common approach to determining a compound's chemical formula is to first measure the masses of its constituent elements. However, keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the relative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally derived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in the compound. This is accomplished using molar masses to convert the mass of each element to a number of moles. These molar amounts are used to compute whole-number ratios that can be used to derive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H . The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 1.71 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{C} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{C}}{12.01 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{C}}=0.142 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{C} \\\\\n& 0.287 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{H} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}}{1.008 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{H}}=0.284 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, this compound may be represented by the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{0.142} \\mathrm{H}_{0.284}$. Per convention, formulas contain wholenumber subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing each subscript by the smaller subscript:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\frac{0.142}{0.142}} \\mathrm{H}_{\\frac{0.284}{0.142}} \\text { or } \\mathrm{CH}_{2}\n$$\n\n(Recall that subscripts of \" 1 \" are not written but rather assumed if no other number is present.)\nThe empirical formula for this compound is thus $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$. This may or not be the compound's molecular formula\nas well; however, additional information is needed to make that determination (as discussed later in this section).",

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry's law.",

Barbiturates, a large class of drugs with a wide variety of uses, constitute one of the earliest successes of medicinal chemistry. The synthesis and medical use of barbiturates goes back to 1904 when Bayer, a German chemical company, first marketed a compound called barbital, trade named Veronal, as a treatment for insomnia. Since that time, more than 2500 different barbiturate analogs have been synthesized by drug companies, more than 50 have been used medicinally, and about a dozen are still in use as anesthetics, anticonvulsants, sedatives, and anxiolytics.\n\n\nFIGURE 22.8 Different barbiturates come in a multitude of colors, giving rise to similarly colorful street names when the drugs are abused. (credit: \"Medications\" by freestocks.org/Flickr, Public Domain)\n\nThe synthesis of barbiturates is relatively simple and relies on reactions that are now familiar: enolate alkylations and nucleophilic acyl substitutions. Starting with diethyl malonate, alkylation of the corresponding enolate ion with simple alkyl halides provides a wealth of different disubstituted malonic esters. Reaction with urea, $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~N}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$, then gives the product barbiturates by a twofold nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of the ester groups with the $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ groups of urea (FIGURE 22.9). Amobarbital (Amytal), pentobarbital (Nembutal), and secobarbital (Seconal) are typical examples.",

In the early days of organic chemistry, basic amines derived from natural sources were known as vegetable alkali, but they are now called alkaloids. More than 20,000 alkaloids are known. Their study provided much of the impetus for the growth of organic chemistry in the nineteenth century and remains today an active and fascinating area of research.\n\n\nFIGURE 2.9 The coca bush Erythroxylon coca, native to upland rain forest areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and western Brazil, is the source of the alkaloid cocaine.

As just three examples, morphine, an analgesic agent (painkiller), is obtained from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. Ephedrine, a bronchodilator, decongestant, and appetite suppressant, is obtained from Ephedra sinica, an evergreen shrub native to Mongolia and northeastern China. Cocaine, both an anesthetic and a stimulant, is obtained from the coca bush Erythroxylon coca, endemic to the upland rain forest areas of central South America.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by its height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 16.15). When this statue was first delivered from France, its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms.

Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Could we \"app\" chemistry?\n\nIn a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical \"inks\" with a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion a \"universal toolkit of chemistry.\" This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new superbug or to \"print\" medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health situation.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ). Starting from only a few simple materials, it's possible to prepare many thousands of substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n\nHalogenation\n\n\nNitration\n\n\n\n\nAcylation\n\n\nAlkylation\n\n\nSulfonation\n\nHydroxylation",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Give the structure of the enol and provide an explanation as to why the enol tautomer is favored.\n\n\nPROBLEM Compounds called azo dyes are the major source of artificial color in textiles and food. Part of the\n15-56 reason for their intense coloring is the conjugation from an electron-donating group through the diazo bridge ( $-\\mathrm{N}=\\mathrm{N}-$ ) to an electron-withdrawing group on the other side. For the following azo dyes, draw a resonance form that shows how the electron-donating group is related to the electronwithdrawing group on the other side of the diazo bridge.

On the one hand, this complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of fairly small molecules-little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another. The $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ absorption of a ketone is almost always in the range 1680 to $1750 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ absorption of an alcohol is almost always in the range 3400 to $3650 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ absorption of an alkene is almost always in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; and so forth.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

We've seen several kinds of isomers in the past few chapters, and it's a good idea at this point to see how they relate to one another (FIGURE 5.15).\n\n\nFIGURE 5.15 A summary of the different kinds of isomers.\nThere are two fundamental types of isomers, both of which we've now encountered: constitutional isomers and stereoisomers.\n\nConstitutional isomers (Section 3.2) are compounds whose atoms are connected differently. Among the kinds of constitutional isomers we've seen are skeletal, functional, and positional isomers.\n\n| Different carbon skeletons | <smiles>CC(C)C</smiles> | and | $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  | 2-Methylpropane |  | Butane |\n| Different functional groups | $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{OH}$ | and | $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OCH}_{3}$ |\n|  | Ethyl alcohol |  | Dimethyl ether |\n| Different position of functional groups | <smiles>CC(C)N</smiles> | and | $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ |\n|  | Isopropylamine |  | Propylamine |\n\nStereoisomers (Section 4.2) are compounds whose atoms are connected in the same order but with a different spatial arrangement. Among the kinds of stereoisomers we've seen are enantiomers, diastereomers, and cis-trans isomers of cycloalkanes. Actually, cis-trans isomers are just a subclass of diastereomers because they are non-mirror-image stereoisomers:\n\n```\nEnantiomers (nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers)\n```\n\n```\nDiastereomers\n(nonsuperimposable\nnon-mirror-image\nstereoisomers)\n```\n\nConfigurational diastereomers",

If the alkyl substituent is smaller than the ring (six or fewer carbons), the arene is referred to as an alkyl-substituted benzene. If the alkyl substituent is larger than the ring (seven or more carbons), the compound is referred to as a phenyl-substituted alkane. The name phenyl, pronounced fen-nil and sometimes abbreviated as Ph or $\\Phi$ (Greek phi), is used for the $-\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5}$ unit when the benzene ring\nis considered a substituent. The word is derived from the Greek pheno (\"I bear light\"), commemorating the discovery of benzene by Michael Faraday in 1825 from the oily residue left by the illuminating gas used in London street lamps. In addition, the name benzyl is used for the $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - group.\n\n\nDisubstituted benzenes are named using the prefixes ortho (o), meta (m), or para (p). An ortho-disubstituted benzene has its two substituents in a 1,2 relationship on the ring, a meta-disubstituted benzene has its two substituents in a 1,3 relationship, and a para-disubstituted benzene has its substituents in a 1,4 relationship.\n\northo-Dichlorobenzene 1,2 disubstituted\n\nmeta-Dimethylbenzene (meta-xylene) 1,3 disubstituted\n\npara-Chlorobenzaldehyde\n1,4 disubstituted\n\nThe ortho, meta, para system of nomenclature is also useful when discussing reactions. For example, we might describe the reaction of bromine with toluene by saying, \"Reaction occurs at the para position,\" meaning at the position para to the methyl group already present on the ring.",

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes - \nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:\n\n1. To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 21.1.\n2. Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.\n\npropane\n\n\n2-chloropropane\n\n\n2-methylpropane\n\n\n2,4-difluorohexane\n\n\n1-bromo-3-chlorohexane\n\nWhen more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di-(two), tri- (three), tetra-(four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents).",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

By the end of this chapter, we will have seen all the common functional groups. Of those groups, carbonyl compounds and amines are the most abundant and have the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush. In addition, amino acids are the building blocks from\nwhich all proteins are made, and cyclic amine bases are constituents of nucleic acids.\n\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\nNicotine\n\n\nCocaine",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Iron occurs everywhere-from the rings in your spiral notebook and the cutlery in your kitchen to automobiles, ships, buildings, and in the hemoglobin in your blood. Titanium is useful in the manufacture of lightweight, durable products such as bicycle frames, artificial hips, and jewelry. Chromium is useful as a protective plating on plumbing fixtures and automotive detailing.\n\nIn addition to being used in their pure elemental forms, many compounds containing transition metals have numerous other applications. Silver nitrate is used to create mirrors, zirconium silicate provides friction in automotive brakes, and many important cancer-fighting agents, like the drug cisplatin and related species, are platinum compounds.\n\nThe variety of properties exhibited by transition metals is due to their complex valence shells. Unlike most main group metals where one oxidation state is normally observed, the valence shell structure of transition metals means that they usually occur in several different stable oxidation states. In addition, electron transitions in these elements can correspond with absorption of photons in the visible electromagnetic spectrum, leading to colored compounds. Because of these behaviors, transition metals exhibit a rich and fascinating chemistry.",

Sulfur Oxyacids and Salts - \nThe preparation of sulfuric acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (shown in Figure 18.54), begins with the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur trioxide and then converting the trioxide to sulfuric acid. Pure sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid that freezes at $10.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. It fumes when heated because the acid decomposes to water and sulfur trioxide. The heating process causes the loss of more sulfur trioxide than water, until reaching a concentration of $98.33 \\%$ acid. Acid of this concentration boils at $338^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ without further change in concentration (a constant boiling solution) and is commercially concentrated $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$. The amount of sulfuric acid used in industry exceeds that of any other manufactured compound.\n\n\nFIGURE 18.54 Sulfuric acid has a tetrahedral molecular structure.\nThe strong affinity of concentrated sulfuric acid for water makes it a good dehydrating agent. It is possible to dry gases and immiscible liquids that do not react with the acid by passing them through the acid.\n\nSulfuric acid is a strong diprotic acid that ionizes in two stages. In aqueous solution, the first stage is essentially complete. The secondary ionization is not nearly so complete, and $\\mathrm{HSO}_{4}{ }^{-}$is a moderately strong acid (about $25 \\%$ ionized in solution of a $\\mathrm{HSO}_{4}{ }^{-}$salt: $K_{\\mathrm{a}}=1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ ).\n\nBeing a diprotic acid, sulfuric acid forms both sulfates, such as $\\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$, and hydrogen sulfates, such as $\\mathrm{NaHSO}_{4}$. Most sulfates are soluble in water; however, the sulfates of barium, strontium, calcium, and lead are only slightly soluble in water.",

Occurrence, Preparation, and Properties of Transition Metals and Their Compounds\nThe transition metals are elements with partially filled $d$ orbitals, located in the $d$-block of the periodic table. The reactivity of the transition elements varies widely from very active metals such as scandium and iron to almost inert elements, such as the platinum metals. The type of chemistry used in the isolation of the elements from their ores depends upon the concentration of the element in its ore and the difficulty of reducing ions of the elements to the metals. Metals that are more active are more difficult to reduce.\n\nTransition metals exhibit chemical behavior typical of metals. For example, they oxidize in air upon heating and react with elemental halogens to form halides. Those elements that lie above hydrogen in the activity series react with acids, producing salts and hydrogen gas. Oxides, hydroxides, and carbonates of transition metal compounds in low oxidation states are basic. Halides and other salts are generally stable in water, although oxygen must be excluded in some cases. Most transition metals form a variety of stable oxidation states, allowing them to demonstrate a wide range of chemical reactivity.",

Remember that bond polarity is a continuous spectrum with electrons being shared evenly (covalent bonds) at one extreme and electrons being transferred completely (ionic bonds) at the other. No bond is ever 100\\% ionic, and the degree to which the electrons are evenly distributed determines many properties of the compound. Transition metal halides with low oxidation numbers form more ionic bonds.

As shown in Figure 19.2, the $\\boldsymbol{d}$-block elements in groups 3-11 are transition elements. The $\\boldsymbol{f}$-block elements, also called inner transition metals (the lanthanides and actinides), also meet this criterion because the $d$ orbital is partially occupied before the $f$ orbitals. The $d$ orbitals fill with the copper family (group 11); for this reason, the\nnext family (group 12) are technically not transition elements. However, the group 12 elements do display some of the same chemical properties and are commonly included in discussions of transition metals. Some chemists do treat the group 12 elements as transition metals.\n\n\nFIGURE 19.2 The transition metals are located in groups 3-11 of the periodic table. The inner transition metals are in the two rows below the body of the table.\n\nThe $d$-block elements are divided into the first transition series (the elements Sc through Cu ), the second transition series (the elements Y through Ag), and the third transition series (the element La and the elements Hf through Au).

Although hydrogen is in group 1 (and also in group 17), it is a nonmetal and deserves separate consideration later in this chapter. The name alkali metal is in reference to the fact that these metals and their oxides react with water to form very basic (alkaline) solutions.\n\nThe properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of $1+$. Their\nreactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements.

Sample reactions are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathrm{NiCO}_{3}(s)+2 \\mathrm{HF}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{NiF}_{2}(a q)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Co}(\\mathrm{OH})_{2}(s)+2 \\mathrm{HBr}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CoBr}_{2}(a q)+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nMost of the first transition series metals also dissolve in acids, forming a solution of the salt and hydrogen gas. For example:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cr}(s)+2 \\mathrm{HCl}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CrCl}_{2}(a q)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)\n$$",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush. In addition, amino acids are the building blocks from\nwhich all proteins are made, and cyclic amine bases are constituents of nucleic acids.\n\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\nNicotine\n\n\nCocaine",

In the early days of organic chemistry, basic amines derived from natural sources were known as vegetable alkali, but they are now called alkaloids. More than 20,000 alkaloids are known. Their study provided much of the impetus for the growth of organic chemistry in the nineteenth century and remains today an active and fascinating area of research.\n\n\nFIGURE 2.9 The coca bush Erythroxylon coca, native to upland rain forest areas of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and western Brazil, is the source of the alkaloid cocaine.

As just three examples, morphine, an analgesic agent (painkiller), is obtained from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. Ephedrine, a bronchodilator, decongestant, and appetite suppressant, is obtained from Ephedra sinica, an evergreen shrub native to Mongolia and northeastern China.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush.

As shown in the following compound, the red symbols represent the smaller alkyl group and the oxygen atom, which would be named \"methoxy.\" The larger carbon branch would be ethane, making the molecule methoxyethane. Many ethers are referred to with common names instead of the IUPAC system names. For common names, the two branches connected to the oxygen atom are named separately and followed by \"ether.\" The common name for the compound shown in Example 21.9 is ethylmethyl ether:\n\n[^16]\n\nEXAMPLE 21.9",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The synthesis and medical use of barbiturates goes back to 1904 when Bayer, a German chemical company, first marketed a compound called barbital, trade named Veronal, as a treatment for insomnia. Since that time, more than 2500 different barbiturate analogs have been synthesized by drug companies, more than 50 have been used medicinally, and about a dozen are still in use as anesthetics, anticonvulsants, sedatives, and anxiolytics.\n\n\nFIGURE 22.8 Different barbiturates come in a multitude of colors, giving rise to similarly colorful street names when the drugs are abused. (credit: \"Medications\" by freestocks.org/Flickr, Public Domain)\n\nThe synthesis of barbiturates is relatively simple and relies on reactions that are now familiar: enolate alkylations and nucleophilic acyl substitutions.

When the substituents have been identified, the parent chain has been numbered, and the proper multipliers such as di- and tri- have been assigned, the name is written with the substituents listed in alphabetical, rather than numerical, order. Multipliers such as di- and tri- are not used for\nalphabetization, but the italicized prefixes iso- and sec- are used.\n\n2. 5-Amino-3-methyl-2-pentanol\n3. Use of hyphens; single- and multiple-word names. The general rule is to determine whether the parent is itself an element or compound. If it is, then the name is written as a single word; if it isn't, then the name is written as multiple words. Methylbenzene is written as one word, for instance, because the parent-benzene-is a compound. Diethyl ether, however, is written as two words because the parent-ether-is a class name rather than a compound name.

Parentheses. Parentheses are used to denote complex substituents when ambiguity would otherwise arise. For example, chloromethylbenzene has two substituents on a benzene ring, but (chloromethyl)benzene has only one complex substituent.

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Solutions are homogeneous at the molecular level, while other mixtures are heterogeneous.\n2. (a) The process is endothermic as the solution is consuming heat. (b) Attraction between the $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}$ ions is stronger than between the ions and water molecules (the ion-ion interactions have a lower, more negative energy). Therefore, the dissolution process increases the energy of the molecular interactions, and it consumes the thermal energy of the solution to make up for the difference. (c) No, an ideal solution is formed with no appreciable heat release or consumption.\n3. (a) ion-dipole forces; (b) dipole-dipole forces; (c) dispersion forces; (d) dispersion forces; (e) hydrogen bonding\n4. Heat is released when the total intermolecular forces (IMFs) between the solute and solvent molecules are stronger than the total IMFs in the pure solute and in the pure solvent: Breaking weaker IMFs and forming stronger IMFs releases heat. Heat is absorbed when the total IMFs in the solution are weaker than the total of those in the pure solute and in the pure solvent: Breaking stronger IMFs and forming weaker IMFs absorbs heat.\n5. Crystals of NaCl dissolve in water, a polar liquid with a very large dipole moment, and the individual ions become strongly solvated. Hexane is a nonpolar liquid with a dipole moment of zero and, therefore, does not significantly interact with the ions of the NaCl crystals.\n6.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

When the substituents have been identified, the parent chain has been numbered, and the proper multipliers such as di- and tri- have been assigned, the name is written with the substituents listed in alphabetical, rather than numerical, order. Multipliers such as di- and tri- are not used for\nalphabetization, but the italicized prefixes iso- and sec- are used.\n\n2. 5-Amino-3-methyl-2-pentanol\n3. Use of hyphens; single- and multiple-word names. The general rule is to determine whether the parent is itself an element or compound. If it is, then the name is written as a single word; if it isn't, then the name is written as multiple words. Methylbenzene is written as one word, for instance, because the parent-benzene-is a compound. Diethyl ether, however, is written as two words because the parent-ether-is a class name rather than a compound name. Some further examples follow:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Mg}-\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\n$$\n\n14. Dimethylmagnesium (one word, because magnesium is an element)\n\n15. 4-(Dimethylamino)pyridine (one word, because pyridine is a compound)\n\n16. Isopropyl 3-hydroxypropanoate (two words, because \"propanoate\" is not a compound)\n\n17. Methyl cyclopentanecarbothioate (two words, because \"cyclopentanecarbothioate\" is not a compound)\n18. Parentheses. Parentheses are used to denote complex substituents when ambiguity would otherwise arise. For example, chloromethylbenzene has two substituents on a benzene ring, but (chloromethyl)benzene has only one complex substituent. Note that the expression in parentheses is not set off by hyphens from the rest of the name.\n\n19. $p$-Chloromethylbenzene\n\n20. (Chloromethyl)benzene",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ).

The products, called Grignard reagents (RMgX) after their discoverer, Francois Auguste Victor Grignard, who received the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are examples of organometallic compounds because they contain a carbon-metal bond. In addition to alkyl halides, Grignard reagents can also be made from alkenyl (vinylic) and aryl (aromatic) halides. The halogen can be Cl, Br, or I, although chlorides are less reactive than bromides and iodides. Organofluorides rarely react with magnesium.\n\n\nAs you might expect from the discussion of electronegativity and bond polarity in Section 6.3, the carbon-magnesium bond is polarized, making the carbon atom of Grignard reagents both nucleophilic and basic. An electrostatic potential map of methylmagnesium iodide, for instance, indicates the electron-rich (red) character of the carbon bonded to magnesium.\n\n\nA Grignard reagent is formally the magnesium salt, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}^{-+} \\mathrm{MgX}$, of a carbon acid, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$, and is thus a carbon anion, or carbanion. But because hydrocarbons are such weak acids, with $\\mathbf{p} \\mathbf{K}_{\\mathbf{a}}$ 's in the range 44 to 60 (Section 9.7), carbon anions are very strong bases. Grignard reagents must therefore be protected from atmospheric moisture to prevent their being protonated and destroyed in acid-base reactions: $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Mg}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{H}+$ HO-Mg-X.",

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ).

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

On the one hand, this complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of fairly small molecules-little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another. The $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ absorption of a ketone is almost always in the range 1680 to $1750 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ absorption of an alcohol is almost always in the range 3400 to $3650 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ absorption of an alkene is almost always in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; and so forth.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ). Starting from only a few simple materials, it's possible to prepare many thousands of substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n\nHalogenation\n\n\nNitration\n\n\n\n\nAcylation\n\n\nAlkylation\n\n\nSulfonation\n\nHydroxylation",

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals.

The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25).

To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ).

The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by its height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 16.15). When this statue was first delivered from France, its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Oxyacids - \nMany compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly\ndiscuss the important compounds known as oxyacids, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids:\n\n1. Omit \"hydrogen\"\n2. Start with the root name of the anion\n3. Replace -ate with -ic, or -ite with -ous\n4. Add \"acid\"\n\nFor example, consider $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (which you might be tempted to call \"hydrogen carbonate\"). To name this correctly, \"hydrogen\" is omitted; the -ate of carbonate is replace with -ic; and acid is added-so its name is carbonic acid. Other examples are given in Table 4.9.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

(a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected.

The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes - \nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:\n\n1. To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 21.1.\n2. Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.\n\npropane\n\n\n2-chloropropane\n\n\n2-methylpropane\n\n\n2,4-difluorohexane\n\n\n1-bromo-3-chlorohexane\n\nWhen more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di-(two), tri- (three), tetra-(four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents).",

According to Lee Cronin (Figure 2.22), chemists make very complicated molecules by \"chopping up\" small molecules and \"reverse engineering\" them. He wonders if we could \"make a really cool universal chemistry set\" by what he calls \"app-ing\" chemistry. Could we \"app\" chemistry?\n\nIn a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical \"inks\" with a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion a \"universal toolkit of chemistry.\" This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new superbug or to \"print\" medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health situation. Says Cronin, \"What Apple did for music, I'd like to do for the discovery and distribution of prescription drugs.\" ${ }^{2}$ View his full talk (http://openstax.org/l/16LeeCronin) at the TED website.\n\n\nFIGURE 2.22 Chemist Lee Cronin has been named one of the UK's 10 most inspirational scientists. The youngest chair at the University of Glasgow, Lee runs a large research group, collaborates with many scientists worldwide, has published over 250 papers in top scientific journals, and has given more than 150 invited talks. His research focuses on complex chemical systems and their potential to transform technology, but also branches into nanoscience, solar fuels, synthetic biology, and even artificial life and evolution. (credit: image courtesy of Lee Cronin)\n\nIt is important to be aware that it may be possible for the same atoms to be arranged in different ways: Compounds with the same molecular formula may have different atom-to-atom bonding and therefore different structures.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Barbiturates, a large class of drugs with a wide variety of uses, constitute one of the earliest successes of medicinal chemistry. The synthesis and medical use of barbiturates goes back to 1904 when Bayer, a German chemical company, first marketed a compound called barbital, trade named Veronal, as a treatment for insomnia. Since that time, more than 2500 different barbiturate analogs have been synthesized by drug companies, more than 50 have been used medicinally, and about a dozen are still in use as anesthetics, anticonvulsants, sedatives, and anxiolytics.\n\n\nFIGURE 22.8 Different barbiturates come in a multitude of colors, giving rise to similarly colorful street names when the drugs are abused. (credit: \"Medications\" by freestocks.org/Flickr, Public Domain)\n\nThe synthesis of barbiturates is relatively simple and relies on reactions that are now familiar: enolate alkylations and nucleophilic acyl substitutions. Starting with diethyl malonate, alkylation of the corresponding enolate ion with simple alkyl halides provides a wealth of different disubstituted malonic esters. Reaction with urea, $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~N}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$, then gives the product barbiturates by a twofold nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of the ester groups with the $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ groups of urea (FIGURE 22.9).

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

On the one hand, this complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of fairly small molecules-little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another. The $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ absorption of a ketone is almost always in the range 1680 to $1750 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ absorption of an alcohol is almost always in the range 3400 to $3650 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ absorption of an alkene is almost always in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; and so forth. By learning where characteristic functional-group absorptions occur, it's possible to get structural information from IR spectra.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids:\n\n1. Omit \"hydrogen\"\n2. Start with the root name of the anion\n3.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger. (d) The paths followed by the $\\alpha$ particles match the predictions from (a), (b), and (c).\n6.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ). Starting from only a few simple materials, it's possible to prepare many thousands of substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n\nHalogenation\n\n\nNitration\n\n\n\n\nAcylation\n\n\nAlkylation\n\n\nSulfonation\n\nHydroxylation",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The atoms that make up the element combine in various ways, ranging from the mostly ionic ( NaCl ) to the partially ionic ( HCl ) to what we will call purely covalent. At the most fundamental level, all chemical bonds involve electrons, and a significant percentage of chemical and physical properties can be explained by considering the location and separation of charge in a species.

Chemistry in Everyday Life - \nOne particularly characteristic phenomenon of waves results when two or more waves come into contact: They interfere with each other. Figure 3.6 shows the interference patterns that arise when light passes through narrow slits closely spaced about a wavelength apart. The fringe patterns produced depend on the wavelength, with the fringes being more closely spaced for shorter wavelength light passing through a given set of slits. When the light passes through the two slits, each slit effectively acts as a new source, resulting in two closely spaced waves coming into contact at the detector (the camera in this case). The dark regions in Figure 3.6 correspond to regions where the peaks for the wave from one slit happen to coincide with the troughs for the wave from the other slit (destructive interference), while the brightest regions correspond to the regions where the peaks for the two waves (or their two troughs) happen to coincide (constructive interference). Likewise, when two stones are tossed close together into a pond, interference patterns are visible in the interactions between the waves produced by the stones. Such interference patterns cannot be explained by particles moving according to the laws of classical mechanics.\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Interference fringe patterns are shown for light passing through two closely spaced, narrow slits.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

(Fluorine is so reactive that it is too dangerous to handle.) (credit: Sahar Atwa)\n\nBromine is only slightly soluble in water, but it is miscible in all proportions in less polar (or nonpolar) solvents such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon disulfide, forming solutions that vary from yellow to reddish-brown, depending on the concentration.\n\nIodine is soluble in chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, carbon disulfide, and many hydrocarbons, giving violet solutions of $\\mathrm{I}_{2}$ molecules. Iodine dissolves only slightly in water, giving brown solutions. It is quite soluble in aqueous solutions of iodides, with which it forms brown solutions. These brown solutions result because iodine molecules have empty valence $d$ orbitals and can act as weak Lewis acids towards the iodide ion. The equation for the reversible reaction of iodine (Lewis acid) with the iodide ion (Lewis base) to form triiodide ion, $\\mathrm{I}_{3}{ }^{-}$, is:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{I}_{2}(s)+\\mathrm{I}^{-}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{I}_{3}^{-}(a q)\n$$",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens.

On the one hand, this complexity is a problem because it generally limits the laboratory use of IR spectroscopy to pure samples of fairly small molecules-little can be learned from IR spectroscopy about large, complex biomolecules. On the other hand, this complexity is useful because an IR spectrum acts as a unique fingerprint of a compound. In fact,\nthe complex region of the IR spectrum, from $1500 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to around $400 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, is called the fingerprint region. If two samples have identical IR spectra, they are almost certainly identical compounds.\n\nFortunately, we don't need to interpret an IR spectrum fully to get useful structural information. Most functional groups have characteristic IR absorption bands that don't change much from one compound to another. The $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$ absorption of a ketone is almost always in the range 1680 to $1750 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ absorption of an alcohol is almost always in the range 3400 to $3650 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; the $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{C}$ absorption of an alkene is almost always in the range 1640 to $1680 \\mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$; and so forth.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

By the end of this chapter, we will have seen all the common functional groups. Of those groups, carbonyl compounds and amines are the most abundant and have the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush. In addition, amino acids are the building blocks from\nwhich all proteins are made, and cyclic amine bases are constituents of nucleic acids.\n\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\nNicotine\n\n\nCocaine",

The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by its height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 16.15). When this statue was first delivered from France, its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale). (b) The diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a $1-\\mathrm{cm}^{3}(1-\\mathrm{mL}) \\mathrm{cube}$.",

Chemistry in Context\nChemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

For example, you may see the words stannous fluoride on a tube of toothpaste. This represents the formula $\\mathrm{SnF}_{2}$, which is more properly named tin(II) fluoride. The other fluoride of tin is $\\mathrm{SnF}_{4}$, which was previously called stannic fluoride but is now named tin(IV) fluoride.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Chemistry in Context\nChemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

Hydrocarbons\n21.2 Alcohols and Ethers\n21.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters\n21.4 Amines and Amides\n\nINTRODUCTION All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds. The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet \"carbon-based\" life. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although a single, precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms.\n\nToday, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter, we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those compounds are classified, and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings.",

The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes - \nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:\n\n1. To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 21.1.\n2. Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.\n\npropane\n\n\n2-chloropropane\n\n\n2-methylpropane\n\n\n2,4-difluorohexane\n\n\n1-bromo-3-chlorohexane\n\nWhen more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di-(two), tri- (three), tetra-(four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents).",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Chemistry: The Central Science - \nChemistry is sometimes referred to as \"the central science\" due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields (Figure 1.3). The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world's population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world.

Determination of Empirical Formulas - \nAs previously mentioned, the most common approach to determining a compound's chemical formula is to first measure the masses of its constituent elements. However, keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the relative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally derived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in the compound. This is accomplished using molar masses to convert the mass of each element to a number of moles. These molar amounts are used to compute whole-number ratios that can be used to derive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H . The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 1.71 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{C} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{C}}{12.01 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{C}}=0.142 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{C} \\\\\n& 0.287 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{H} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}}{1.008 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{H}}=0.284 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, this compound may be represented by the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{0.142} \\mathrm{H}_{0.284}$. Per convention, formulas contain wholenumber subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing each subscript by the smaller subscript:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\frac{0.142}{0.142}} \\mathrm{H}_{\\frac{0.284}{0.142}} \\text { or } \\mathrm{CH}_{2}\n$$\n\n(Recall that subscripts of \" 1 \" are not written but rather assumed if no other number is present.)\nThe empirical formula for this compound is thus $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$. This may or not be the compound's molecular formula\nas well; however, additional information is needed to make that determination (as discussed later in this section).",

In such cases, the percent composition can be used to calculate the masses of elements present in any convenient mass of compound; these masses can then be used to derive the empirical formula in the usual fashion.",

A functional group is a group of atoms within a molecule that has a characteristic chemical behavior. Chemically, a given functional group behaves in nearly the same way in every molecule it's a part of. For example, compare ethylene, a plant hormone that causes fruit to ripen, with menthene, a much more complicated molecule found in peppermint oil. Both substances contain a carbon-carbon double-bond functional group, and both therefore react with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in the same way to give a product in which a Br atom has added to each of the double-bond carbons (FIGURE 3.2). This example is typical: the chemistry of every organic molecule, regardless of size and complexity, is determined by the functional groups it contains.\n\n\n\nEthylene\n\n\n\nMenthene\n\n\n\nFIGURE 3.2 The reactions of ethylene and menthene with bromine. In both molecules, the carbon-carbon double-bond functional group has a similar polarity pattern, so both molecules react with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in the same way. The size and complexity of the molecules are not important.\n\nLook at TABLE 3.1, which lists many of the common functional groups and gives simple examples of their occurrence. Some functional groups have only carbon-carbon double or triple bonds; others have halogen atoms; and still others contain oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. Much of the chemistry you'll be studying is the chemistry of these functional groups.",

By the end of this chapter, we will have seen all the common functional groups. Of those groups, carbonyl compounds and amines are the most abundant and have the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush. In addition, amino acids are the building blocks from\nwhich all proteins are made, and cyclic amine bases are constituents of nucleic acids.\n\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\nNicotine\n\n\nCocaine",

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Secondary allylic and benzylic alkyl halides can also undergo $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ and E1 reactions if a weakly basic nucleophile is used in a protic solvent.\n- Tertiary alkyl halides E2 elimination occurs when a base is used, but $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ substitution and E1 elimination occur together under neutral conditions, such as in pure ethanol or water. E1cB elimination takes place if the leaving group is two carbons away from a carbonyl group.",

Step 1, formation of a tosylate, occurs by breaking the $\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond of the alcohol rather than the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond to the chiral carbon, so the configuration around the carbon is unchanged. Similarly, step 3, hydroxide-ion cleavage of the acetate, takes place without breaking the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond at the chirality center. Thus, the inversion of stereochemical configuration must take place in step 2, the nucleophilic substitution of tosylate ion by acetate ion.\n\n\nFrom this and nearly a dozen other series of similar reactions, researchers concluded that the nucleophilic substitution reaction of a primary or secondary alkyl halide or tosylate always proceeds with inversion of configuration.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

According to Lee Cronin (Figure 2.22), chemists make very complicated molecules by \"chopping up\" small molecules and \"reverse engineering\" them. He wonders if we could \"make a really cool universal chemistry set\" by what he calls \"app-ing\" chemistry. Could we \"app\" chemistry?\n\nIn a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical \"inks\" with a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion a \"universal toolkit of chemistry.\" This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new superbug or to \"print\" medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health situation.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole.

Determination of Empirical Formulas - \nAs previously mentioned, the most common approach to determining a compound's chemical formula is to first measure the masses of its constituent elements. However, keep in mind that chemical formulas represent the relative numbers, not masses, of atoms in the substance. Therefore, any experimentally derived data involving mass must be used to derive the corresponding numbers of atoms in the compound. This is accomplished using molar masses to convert the mass of each element to a number of moles. These molar amounts are used to compute whole-number ratios that can be used to derive the empirical formula of the substance. Consider a sample of compound determined to contain 1.71 g C and 0.287 g H . The corresponding numbers of atoms (in moles) are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 1.71 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{C} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{C}}{12.01 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{C}}=0.142 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{C} \\\\\n& 0.287 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{H} \\times \\frac{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}}{1.008 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{H}}=0.284 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, this compound may be represented by the formula $\\mathrm{C}_{0.142} \\mathrm{H}_{0.284}$. Per convention, formulas contain wholenumber subscripts, which can be achieved by dividing each subscript by the smaller subscript:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{C}_{\\frac{0.142}{0.142}} \\mathrm{H}_{\\frac{0.284}{0.142}} \\text { or } \\mathrm{CH}_{2}\n$$\n\n(Recall that subscripts of \" 1 \" are not written but rather assumed if no other number is present.)\nThe empirical formula for this compound is thus $\\mathrm{CH}_{2}$.

Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in a previous chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text.\n\nMolecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula. If the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance is known, it may be divided by the empirical formula mass to yield the number of empirical formula units per molecule (n):\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text { molecular or molar mass }\\left(\\mathrm{amu} \\text { or } \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{~mol}}\\right)}{\\text { empirical formula mass }\\left(\\mathrm{amu} \\text { or } \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{~mol}}\\right)}=n \\text { formula units/molecule }\n$$\n\nThe molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by $n$, as shown by the generic empirical formula $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{x}} \\mathrm{B}_{\\mathrm{y}}$ :\n\n$$\n\\left(A_{x} B_{y}\\right)_{n}=A_{n x} B_{n y}\n$$\n\nFor example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$.

Molecular and Empirical Formulas - \nA molecular formula is a representation of a molecule that uses chemical symbols to indicate the types of atoms followed by subscripts to show the number of atoms of each type in the molecule.

Molecular formulas are also used as abbreviations for the names of compounds.\n\nThe structural formula for a compound gives the same information as its molecular formula (the types and numbers of atoms in the molecule) but also shows how the atoms are connected in the molecule. The structural formula for methane contains symbols for one C atom and four H atoms, indicating the number of atoms in the molecule (Figure 2.16). The lines represent bonds that hold the atoms together. (A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms or ions that holds them together in a molecule or a crystal.) We will discuss chemical bonds and see how to predict the arrangement of atoms in a molecule later. For now, simply know that the lines are an indication of how the atoms are connected in a molecule.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two\nsubstances exhibit very different properties. Today, we possess sophisticated instruments that allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the mole, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.\n\nThe mole is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of the number of atoms or molecules in a sample of matter. One Latin connotation for the word \"mole\" is \"large mass\" or \"bulk,\" which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ). Starting from only a few simple materials, it's possible to prepare many thousands of substituted aromatic compounds.\n\n\nHalogenation\n\n\nNitration\n\n\n\n\nAcylation\n\n\nAlkylation\n\n\nSulfonation\n\nHydroxylation",

Equally important is that the electron density of the ring is decreased by the electron-withdrawing inductive effect of the electronegative nitrogen atom.

Of those groups, amines are among the most abundant and have among the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological reactions are amines.\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia. They are named in the IUPAC system either by adding the suffix -amine to the name of the alkyl substituent or by considering the amino group as a substituent on a more complex parent molecule.\nThe chemistry of amines is dominated by the lone-pair electrons on nitrogen, which makes amines both basic and nucleophilic. The basicity of arylamines is generally lower than that of alkylamines because the nitrogen lone-pair electrons are delocalized by interaction with the aromatic $\\pi$ system. Electron-withdrawing substituents on the aromatic ring further weaken the basicity of a substituted aniline, while electron-donating substituents increase basicity. Alkylamines are sufficiently basic that they exist almost entirely in their protonated form at the physiological pH of 7.3.\n\nHeterocyclic amines are compounds that contain one or more nitrogen atoms as part of a ring. Saturated\nheterocyclic amines usually have the same chemistry as their open-chain analogs, but unsaturated heterocycles such as pyrrole, imidazole, pyridine, and pyrimidine are aromatic. All four are unusually stable, and all undergo aromatic substitution on reaction with electrophiles. Pyrrole is nonbasic because its nitrogen lone-pair electrons are part of the aromatic $\\pi$ system.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

By the end of this chapter, we will have seen all the common functional groups. Of those groups, carbonyl compounds and amines are the most abundant and have the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush.

The Statue of Liberty is easily identified by its height, stance, and unique blue-green color (Figure 16.15). When this statue was first delivered from France, its appearance was not green. It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps. Copper metal is oxidized to copper(I) oxide ( $\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ ), which is red, and then to copper(II) oxide, which is black\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2 \\mathrm{Cu}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s) \\\\\n\\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(s)+\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(g) & \\longrightarrow 2 \\mathrm{CuO}(s)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nCoal, which was often high in sulfur, was burned extensively in the early part of the last century.

The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter.

Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected.

The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Sulfur Oxyacids and Salts - \nThe preparation of sulfuric acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (shown in Figure 18.54), begins with the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur trioxide and then converting the trioxide to sulfuric acid. Pure sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid that freezes at $10.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. It fumes when heated because the acid decomposes to water and sulfur trioxide. The heating process causes the loss of more sulfur trioxide than water, until reaching a concentration of $98.33 \\%$ acid.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Oxyacids - \nMany compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly\ndiscuss the important compounds known as oxyacids, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids:\n\n1. Omit \"hydrogen\"\n2. Start with the root name of the anion\n3.

To name this correctly, \"hydrogen\" is omitted; the -ate of carbonate is replace with -ic; and acid is added-so its name is carbonic acid. Other examples are given in Table 4.9. There are some exceptions to the general naming method (e.g., $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ is called sulfuric acid, not sulfic acid, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ is sulfurous, not sulfous, acid).\n\nNames of Common Oxyacids\n\n| Formula | Anion Name | Acid Name |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $\\mathrm{HC}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ | acetate | acetic acid |\n| $\\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ | nitrate | nitric acid |\n| $\\mathrm{HNO}_{2}$ | nitrite | nitrous acid |\n| $\\mathrm{HClO}_{4}$ | perchlorate | perchloric acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ | carbonate | carbonic acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ | sulfate | sulfuric acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ | sulfite | sulfurous acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ | phosphate | phosphoric acid |",

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms.

Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

Although much of the chemistry of the two classes is similar, there are also substantial differences. Amines are classified as primary ( $\\mathbf{R N H}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ ), secondary ( $\\left.\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\mathbf{N H}\\right)$, or tertiary $\\left(\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{3}} \\mathbf{N}\\right)$, depending on the number of organic substituents attached to nitrogen. Thus, methylamine $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ is a primary amine, dimethylamine $\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{NH}\\right]$ is a secondary amine, and trimethylamine $\\left[\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{~N}\\right]$ is a tertiary amine. Note that this usage of the terms primary, secondary, and tertiary differs from our previous usage. When we speak of a tertiary alcohol or alkyl halide, we refer to the degree of substitution at the alkyl carbon atom, but when we speak of a tertiary amine, we refer to the degree of substitution at the nitrogen atom.\n\ntert-Butyl alcohol (a tertiary alcohol)\n\n\nTrimethylamine (a tertiary amine)\n\ntert-Butylamine\n(a primary amine)\n\nCompounds containing a nitrogen atom with four attached groups also exist, but the nitrogen atom must carry a formal positive charge.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

By the end of this chapter, we will have seen all the common functional groups. Of those groups, carbonyl compounds and amines are the most abundant and have the richest chemistry. In addition to proteins and nucleic acids, the majority of pharmaceutical agents contain amine functional groups, and many of the common coenzymes necessary for biological catalysis are amines.\n\nAmines are organic derivatives of ammonia in the same way that alcohols and ethers are organic derivatives of water. Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush. In addition, amino acids are the building blocks from\nwhich all proteins are made, and cyclic amine bases are constituents of nucleic acids.\n\n\nTrimethylamine\n\n\nNicotine\n\n\nCocaine",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid. Oxyacids are named by changing the ending of the anion (-ate to -ic and -ite to -ous), and adding \"acid;\" $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is carbonic acid.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

Chemistry: The Central Science - \nChemistry is sometimes referred to as \"the central science\" due to its interconnectedness with a vast array of other STEM disciplines (STEM stands for areas of study in the science, technology, engineering, and math fields). Chemistry and the language of chemists play vital roles in biology, medicine, materials science, forensics, environmental science, and many other fields (Figure 1.3). The basic principles of physics are essential for understanding many aspects of chemistry, and there is extensive overlap between many subdisciplines within the two fields, such as chemical physics and nuclear chemistry. Mathematics, computer science, and information theory provide important tools that help us calculate, interpret, describe, and generally make sense of the chemical world. Biology and chemistry converge in biochemistry, which is crucial to understanding the many complex factors and processes that keep living organisms (such as us) alive. Chemical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology combine chemical principles and empirical findings to produce useful substances, ranging from gasoline to fabrics to electronics. Agriculture, food science, veterinary science, and brewing and wine making help provide sustenance in the form of food and drink to the world's population. Medicine, pharmacology, biotechnology, and botany identify and produce substances that help keep us healthy. Environmental science, geology, oceanography, and atmospheric science incorporate many chemical ideas to help us better understand and protect our physical world. Chemical ideas are used to help understand the universe in astronomy and cosmology.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.3 Knowledge of chemistry is central to understanding a wide range of scientific disciplines.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

It was brown, the color of its copper \"skin.\" So how did the Statue of Liberty change colors? The change in appearance was a direct result of corrosion. The copper that is the primary component of the statue slowly underwent oxidation from the air. The oxidation-reduction reactions of copper metal in the environment occur in several steps.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

This chapter continues the coverage of aromatic molecules begun in the preceding chapter, but we'll shift focus to concentrate on reactions, looking at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity. This relationship is critical in understanding how many biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nIn the preceding chapter, we looked at aromaticity-the stability associated with benzene and related compounds that contain a cyclic conjugated system of $4 n+2 \\pi$ electrons. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the unique reactions that aromatic molecules undergo.\n\nThe most common reaction of aromatic compounds is electrophilic aromatic substitution, in which an electrophile ( $E^{+}$) reacts with an aromatic ring and substitutes for one of the hydrogens. The reaction is characteristic of all aromatic rings, not just benzene and substituted benzenes. In fact, the ability of a compound to undergo electrophilic substitution is a good test of aromaticity.\n\n\nMany different substituents can be introduced onto an aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution. To list some possibilities, an aromatic ring can be substituted by a halogen $(-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{I})$, a nitro group $\\left(-\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right)$, a sulfonic acid group $\\left(-\\mathrm{SO}_{3} \\mathrm{H}\\right)$, a hydroxyl group $(-\\mathrm{OH})$, an alkyl group ( -R ), or an acyl group ( -COR ).

The products, called Grignard reagents (RMgX) after their discoverer, Francois Auguste Victor Grignard, who received the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are examples of organometallic compounds because they contain a carbon-metal bond. In addition to alkyl halides, Grignard reagents can also be made from alkenyl (vinylic) and aryl (aromatic) halides. The halogen can be Cl, Br, or I, although chlorides are less reactive than bromides and iodides. Organofluorides rarely react with magnesium.\n\n\nAs you might expect from the discussion of electronegativity and bond polarity in Section 6.3, the carbon-magnesium bond is polarized, making the carbon atom of Grignard reagents both nucleophilic and basic. An electrostatic potential map of methylmagnesium iodide, for instance, indicates the electron-rich (red) character of the carbon bonded to magnesium.\n\n\nA Grignard reagent is formally the magnesium salt, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}^{-+} \\mathrm{MgX}$, of a carbon acid, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$, and is thus a carbon anion, or carbanion.

In particular, we've looked at the relationship between aromatic structure and reactivity, a relationship critical to understanding how numerous biological molecules and pharmaceutical agents are synthesized and why they behave as they do.\n\nAn electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction takes place in two steps-initial reaction of an electrophile, $\\mathbf{E}^{+}$, with the aromatic ring, followed by loss of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the resonance-stabilized carbocation intermediate to regenerate the aromatic ring.\n\n\nMany variations of the reaction can be carried out, including halogenation, nitration, and sulfonation. Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation reactions, which involve reaction of an aromatic ring with carbocation electrophiles, are particularly useful. They are limited, however, by the fact that the aromatic ring must be at least as reactive as a halobenzene. In addition, polyalkylation and carbocation rearrangements often occur in Friedel-Crafts alkylation.\n\nSubstituents on the benzene ring affect both the reactivity of the ring toward further substitution and the orientation of that substitution. Groups can be classified as ortho- and para-directing activators, ortho- and para-directing deactivators, or meta-directing deactivators. Substituents influence aromatic rings by a combination of resonance and inductive effects. Resonance effects are transmitted through $\\pi$ bonds; inductive effects are transmitted through $\\sigma$ bonds.\n\nHalobenzenes undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution through either of two mechanisms. If the halobenzene has a strongly electron-withdrawing substituent in the ortho or para position, substitution occurs by addition of a nucleophile to the ring, followed by elimination of halide from the intermediate anion. If the halobenzene is not activated by an electron-withdrawing substituent, substitution can occur by elimination of HX to give a benzyne, followed by addition of a nucleophile.",

As noted in Section 8.7, an organic oxidation results in a loss of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a more electronegative atom (usually $\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{N}$, or a halogen) or by bond-breaking between carbon and a less electronegative atom (usually H). Conversely, an organic reduction results in a gain of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a less electronegative atom or by bond-breaking between carbon and a more electronegative atom (Section 8.6).\n\nOxidation $\\quad$| Decreases electron density on carbon by: |  |  |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n|  | - forming one of these: $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O} \\quad \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{N}$ | $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ |\n|  | $\\quad$ or breaking this: $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ |  |\n\nBased on these definitions, the chlorination reaction of methane to yield chloromethane is an oxidation because a $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond is broken and a $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond is formed.

In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms.

For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length (Figure 1.25). The standard volume is a cubic meter ( $\\mathbf{m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ), a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.\n\nA more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter ( 0.1 m , or 10 cm ). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter ( $\\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ ). A liter ( $\\mathbf{L}$ ) is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.\n\nA cubic centimeter ( $\\mathbf{c m}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ ) is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation cc (for cubic centimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a milliliter ( $\\mathbf{m L}$ ) and is $1 / 1000$ of a liter.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.25 (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of $1 \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, 1 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~L})$, and $1 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}(1 \\mathrm{~mL})$ (not to scale).

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

Little was known about chemistry at that time, and the behavior of the \"organic\" substances isolated from plants and animals seemed different from that of the \"inorganic\" substances found in minerals. Organic compounds were generally low-melting solids and were usually more difficult to isolate, purify, and work with than high-melting inorganic compounds.\n\nBy the mid-1800s, however, it was clear that there was no fundamental difference between organic and inorganic compounds. The only distinguishing characteristic of organic compounds is that all contain the element carbon.\n\nOrganic chemistry, then, is the study of carbon compounds. But why is carbon special? Why, of the more than 197 million presently known chemical compounds, do almost all of them contain carbon? The answers to these questions come from carbon's electronic structure and its consequent position in the periodic table (FIGURE 1.2). As a group 4A element, carbon can share four valence electrons and form four strong covalent bonds. Furthermore, carbon atoms can bond to one another, forming long chains and rings. Carbon, alone of all elements, is able to form an immense diversity of compounds, from the simple methane, with one carbon atom, to the staggeringly complex DNA, which can have more than 100 million carbons.",

Barbiturates, a large class of drugs with a wide variety of uses, constitute one of the earliest successes of medicinal chemistry. The synthesis and medical use of barbiturates goes back to 1904 when Bayer, a German chemical company, first marketed a compound called barbital, trade named Veronal, as a treatment for insomnia. Since that time, more than 2500 different barbiturate analogs have been synthesized by drug companies, more than 50 have been used medicinally, and about a dozen are still in use as anesthetics, anticonvulsants, sedatives, and anxiolytics.\n\n\nFIGURE 22.8 Different barbiturates come in a multitude of colors, giving rise to similarly colorful street names when the drugs are abused. (credit: \"Medications\" by freestocks.org/Flickr, Public Domain)\n\nThe synthesis of barbiturates is relatively simple and relies on reactions that are now familiar: enolate alkylations and nucleophilic acyl substitutions. Starting with diethyl malonate, alkylation of the corresponding enolate ion with simple alkyl halides provides a wealth of different disubstituted malonic esters. Reaction with urea, $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{~N}\\right)_{2} \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$, then gives the product barbiturates by a twofold nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of the ester groups with the $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ groups of urea (FIGURE 22.9).

Like ammonia, amines contain a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making amines both basic and nucleophilic. We'll soon see, in fact, that most of the chemistry of amines depends on the presence of this lone pair of electrons.\n\nAmines occur widely in all living organisms. Trimethylamine, for instance, occurs in animal tissues and is partially responsible for the distinctive odor of fish; nicotine is found in tobacco; and cocaine is a stimulant found in the leaves of the South American coca bush.

Amides aren't protonated by aqueous acids, and they are poor nucleophiles. The main reason for this difference in basicity between amines and amides is that an amide is stabilized by delocalization of the nitrogen lone-pair electrons through orbital overlap with the carbonyl group. In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored. The following electrostatic potential maps clearly show a reduced electron density on the amide nitrogen.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

The quinoline alkaloid quinine, for instance, is widely used as an antimalarial drug; tryptophan is a common amino acid; and the purine adenine is a constituent of nucleic acids.\n\n\nQuinine (antimalarial)\n\n\nTryptophan\n(amino acid)\n\n\nAdenine (DNA constituent)\n\nThe chemistry of these polycyclic heterocycles is just what you might expect from a knowledge of the simpler heterocycles pyridine and pyrrole. Quinoline and isoquinoline both have basic, pyridine-like nitrogen atoms, and both undergo electrophilic substitutions. As with pyridine, both quinoline and isoquinoline are less reactive toward electrophilic substitution than benzene because of the electronegative nitrogen atom that withdraws electrons from the ring. Reaction occurs on the benzene ring rather than on the nitrogen-containing pyridine ring, and a mixture of substitution products is obtained.\n\n\nIndole has a nonbasic, pyrrole-like nitrogen and undergoes electrophilic substitution more easily than benzene. Substitution occurs at C3 of the electron-rich pyrrole ring rather than on the benzene ring.\n\n\nPurine has three basic, pyridine-like nitrogens with lone-pair electrons in $s p^{2}$ orbitals in the plane of the ring. The remaining purine nitrogen is nonbasic and pyrrole-like, with its lone-pair electrons as part of the aromatic\n$\\pi$ electron system.\n\n\n\nPurine\nPROBLEM Which nitrogen atom in the hallucinogenic indole alkaloid $N, N$-dimethyltryptamine is more basic? 24-23 Explain.",

In resonance terms, amides are more stable and less reactive than amines because they are hybrids of two resonance forms. This amide resonance stabilization is lost when the nitrogen atom is protonated, so protonation is disfavored.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

If the alkyl substituent is smaller than the ring (six or fewer carbons), the arene is referred to as an alkyl-substituted benzene. If the alkyl substituent is larger than the ring (seven or more carbons), the compound is referred to as a phenyl-substituted alkane. The name phenyl, pronounced fen-nil and sometimes abbreviated as Ph or $\\Phi$ (Greek phi), is used for the $-\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5}$ unit when the benzene ring\nis considered a substituent. The word is derived from the Greek pheno (\"I bear light\"), commemorating the discovery of benzene by Michael Faraday in 1825 from the oily residue left by the illuminating gas used in London street lamps. In addition, the name benzyl is used for the $\\mathrm{C}_{6} \\mathrm{H}_{5} \\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - group.\n\n\nDisubstituted benzenes are named using the prefixes ortho (o), meta (m), or para (p). An ortho-disubstituted benzene has its two substituents in a 1,2 relationship on the ring, a meta-disubstituted benzene has its two substituents in a 1,3 relationship, and a para-disubstituted benzene has its substituents in a 1,4 relationship.\n\northo-Dichlorobenzene 1,2 disubstituted\n\nmeta-Dimethylbenzene (meta-xylene) 1,3 disubstituted\n\npara-Chlorobenzaldehyde\n1,4 disubstituted\n\nThe ortho, meta, para system of nomenclature is also useful when discussing reactions.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The Basics of Organic Nomenclature: Naming Alkanes - \nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has devised a system of nomenclature that begins with the names of the alkanes and can be adjusted from there to account for more complicated structures. The nomenclature for alkanes is based on two rules:\n\n1. To name an alkane, first identify the longest chain of carbon atoms in its structure. A two-carbon chain is called ethane; a three-carbon chain, propane; and a four-carbon chain, butane. Longer chains are named as follows: pentane (five-carbon chain), hexane (6), heptane (7), octane (8), nonane (9), and decane (10). These prefixes can be seen in the names of the alkanes described in Table 21.1.\n2. Add prefixes to the name of the longest chain to indicate the positions and names of substituents. Substituents are branches or functional groups that replace hydrogen atoms on a chain. The position of a substituent or branch is identified by the number of the carbon atom it is bonded to in the chain. We number the carbon atoms in the chain by counting from the end of the chain nearest the substituents. Multiple substituents are named individually and placed in alphabetical order at the front of the name.\n\npropane\n\n\n2-chloropropane\n\n\n2-methylpropane\n\n\n2,4-difluorohexane\n\n\n1-bromo-3-chlorohexane\n\nWhen more than one substituent is present, either on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms, the substituents are listed alphabetically. Because the carbon atom numbering begins at the end closest to a substituent, the longest chain of carbon atoms is numbered in such a way as to produce the lowest number for the substituents. The ending -o replaces -ide at the end of the name of an electronegative substituent (in ionic compounds, the negatively charged ion ends with -ide like chloride; in organic compounds, such atoms are treated as substituents and the -o ending is used). The number of substituents of the same type is indicated by the prefixes di-(two), tri- (three), tetra-(four), and so on (for example, difluoro- indicates two fluoride substituents).",

Ionic and molecular compounds are named using somewhat-different methods. Binary ionic compounds typically consist of a metal and a\nnonmetal. The name of the metal is written first, followed by the name of the nonmetal with its ending changed to -ide. For example, $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ is called potassium oxide. If the metal can form ions with different charges, a Roman numeral in parentheses follows the name of the metal to specify its charge. Thus, $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{2}$ is iron(II) chloride and $\\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ is iron(III) chloride. Some compounds contain polyatomic ions; the names of common polyatomic ions should be memorized. Molecular compounds can form compounds with different ratios of their elements, so prefixes are used to specify the numbers of atoms of each element in a molecule of the compound. Examples include $\\mathrm{SF}_{6}$, sulfur hexafluoride, and $\\mathrm{N}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$, dinitrogen tetroxide. Acids are an important class of compounds containing hydrogen and having special nomenclature rules. Binary acids are named using the prefix hydro-, changing the -ide suffix to $-i c$, and adding \"acid;\" HCl is hydrochloric acid.
