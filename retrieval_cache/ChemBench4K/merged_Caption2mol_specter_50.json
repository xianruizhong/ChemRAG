These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Earlier approaches, like the structural classification of natural products (SCONP) and biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), focus on the identification of activity determining scaffolds and the synthesis of corresponding compound collections. More recently, NP fragments identified by means of cheminformatic analysis of the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP) have been combined in unprecedented fashions to yield pseudo natural products (pseudo NPs), which show biological activities unrelated to the guiding NPs.

Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed.

Protecting group patterns must be designed to achieve the desired connectivity and stereoselectivity in high yield. In addition, the nature of the protecting group can directly influence the reactivity of the building block, affecting reaction times and yield.\n\nThe basic features of a building block are highlighted in Figure 7 and include the anomeric leaving group (LG), a participating group (for 1,2-trans linkages) or nonparticipating group (for 1,2-cis linkages) at the C2 position (R 1 ), temporary protecting groups that are stable under glycosylation conditions but readily removed for the next glycosylation reaction (R 2 ) and permanent protecting groups that remain intact until the final global deprotection step (R 3 ).\n\nMammalian carbohydrates are commonly comprised of ten monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, mannose, sialic acid, N-acetlyglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, and xylose ( Figure 8). In principle, each carbohydrate residue can be linked through any of its different functional groups and each linkage generates a new stereocenter. The potential diversity is significant. For example, the number of theoretical structures possible for a hexasaccharide comprised from any one of the ten mammalian monosaccharides is approximately 190 billion! It has been estimated that 224 building blocks would be required to assemble any given mammalian oligosaccharide. 9 However, recent studies have suggested that only 36 building blocks would be required to access approximately 75% of all known mammalian oligosaccharides due to significant overlaps in common connectivities. 10 Thirty of these building blocks are shown in Figure 9 and are ranked by relative abundance in mammalian oligosaccharides.",

The linear phosphodiester and amide bond linkages required for nucleic acid and peptide synthesis are easier to generate because the individual building blocks lack significant steric hindrance and the newly formed bonds are nonstereogenic. In contrast, the synthesis of oligosaccharides, which can be linear or branched, often involves more sterically encumbered building blocks and the newly formed bond is part of a stereogenic center. In order to be useful the reaction must generate the desired linkage with high selectivity.\n\nThe development of a first-generation automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer by Seeberger and coworkers 1 led to the first reported automated synthesis of three linear 1,2-a-linked mannan oligosaccharides and a branched phytoalexin elicitor b-glucan ( Figure 2). The synthesis of these glycoconjugates, which play important roles in the immune response to pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans, 2 began what would become a new chapter in the preparation of glycoconjugates for biological evaluation. Since then, automation has proven to be vastly beneficial. Additional bacterial antigens, cancer antigens, vaccine candidates, and N-linked core oligosaccharides are just a few of the glycoconjugates that have been rapidly synthesized using automation. Moreover, these glycoconjugates have been synthesized on scales that would have been impossible using standard solution-phase synthetic techniques. The goal of this chapter is to review the historical aspects of solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesis as well as recent developments including engineering advancements that have recently led to the design of a fully automated platform, and new and improved chemistries that have broadened the scope of the reactions that can be used in automation.

So far, only one random glycosylation step has been performed and the challenge will be to see if two tandem steps can generate a useful oligosaccharide library. Whether or not the present formulation of random glycosylation succeeds as a dominant strategy for the synthesis of oligosaccharide libraries, this important challenge is open to many approaches where creativity in both formulating the problem, as well as experimentally addressing it, warrants a major international effort.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

In its most common form, it involves modification of a known active scaffold or linking known active scaffolds, although de novo drug design (i.e., from scratch) is also possible. Though highly interrelated, identification of active scaffolds should be conceptually separated from drug design. Traditionally, the drug design process has focused on the molecular determinants of the interactions between the drug and its known or intended molecular target. Nevertheless, current drug design also takes into consideration other relevant processes than influence drug efficacy and safety (e.g., bioavailability, metabolic stability, interaction with antitargets).This chapter provides an overview on possible approaches to identify active scaffolds (including in silico approximations to approach that task) and computational methods to guide the subsequent optimization process. It also discusses in which situations each of the overviewed techniques is more appropriate.",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied.

In the quest to discover drugs that modulate the function of these targets, identification of small-molecule drug leads is one of the earliest steps. Structure-based drug design has emerged as a valuable, inexpensive, and rapid computational resource that identifies lead compounds that are complementary to the structure of the target. Leads identified through this process are biologically evaluated and \"hit compounds\" with affinity and activity are further optimized. This chapter introduces the process of structure-based drug design, including preparation of the ligand database, preparation of the target structure, docking and scoring, and evaluation.",

These other molecules may be used to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn may be used to design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived.

A comparison of the electrode potentials of W(2)(mu-CO)(2)(mu-hpp)(2)(eta(2)-hpp)(2) and the di-p-anisylformamidinate analogue shows that oxidation of the hpp compound is significantly displaced (1.12 V) and shows that the bicyclic guanidinate ligand is considerably better than the formamidinate anion at stabilizing high oxidation states. A differential pulse voltammogram of W(2)(hpp)(4)(TFPB)(2) in THF shows two reduction processes with an E(1/2) of -0.97 V for the first and -1.81 V (vs Ag/AgCl) for the second. DFT calculations on the W(2)(hpp)(4)(2+) units in W(2)(hpp)(4)X(2) compounds show that the metal-metal bonding orbitals are destabilized by the axial ligands, which accounts for significant variations in the W-W distances. The low-energy gas-phase ionizations of W(2)(hpp)(4) are also reported and discussed.",

P-1 -CsN 5 is only 6 meV/atom higher in enthalpy than Pbca-CsN 5 at 60 GPa, and is the lowest enthalpy polymorph above 73 GPa (Figure 1(b)). Both structures consist of layers of Cs atoms sandwiched by layers of pentazolate N \u2212 5 anions oriented differently in the unit cell with respect to one another (Figure 2 Table 1. The average bond length in the P-1 -CsN 5 crystal is also 1.328\u00c5, see Table 1, however, the 0.01 \u00c5 spread of the five bond lengths around their average is slightly larger than the 0.005 \u00c5 spread in the Pbca-CsN 5 structure, which correlates with the reduced symmetry of the P-1 -CsN 5 crystal. The aromaticity of N \u2212 5 is further quantified by calculating the Mayer bond orders 42,43 , which are found to be \u223c1.4 for both phases, i.e. between single and double bonds, see Table 1. Both phases exhibit a significant amount of electron transfer from Cs atoms to N 5 rings giving each pentazolate a total charge of approximately -0.85, the average charge per atom being -0.167, see Table 1 Fig. 3(a). Examination of XRD patterns given in the Supporting Information, Figure S8, reveal the appearance of new intense and narrow Bragg peaks with a simultaneous disappearance of the broad CsN 3 peaks.",

This effect is attributed to the steric shielding provided by this voluminous cation.

Except for a few toxins that are produced by Claviceps paspali, a plant parasitic fungus, most tremorgenic mycotoxins are synthesized by common saprophytic moulds of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus. Since these compounds produce sustained tremor in the abscence of other neurotoxic effects, several authors have suggested that they are the causative agents of a number of naturally occurring incoordination syndromes in ruminants. The nature of the tremor produced by these compounds in laboratory animals is clinically indistinguishable from that occurring naturally. In particular, the most implicated tremorgenic mycotoxins are those that contain a single nitrogen atom in their molecules. Although individual compounds within this group are produced by unrelated fungal species, they all contain a similar biologically active chemical moiety. To date, their mechanism of action is unknown, and their role in neuropharmacology has not yet been defined. However, the presence of a GABA-like conformation within their active nucleus and the limited torsional flexibility of this moiety suggest that they are partial agonists of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). A hypothetical mode of action of these toxins at the GABA receptor sites is presented and discussed.",

Tremorgens have been implicated in a number of neurologic diseases of cattle collectively known as staggers syndromes, and pose significant agricultural and health problems for both cattle and humans. Although the effects of tremorgens are thought to result from transient perturbations of amino acid neurotransmitter release mechanisms, there is reason to believe that acute exposures to toxins with such synaptic effects may result in degeneration of neuronal fiber processes. To test this hypothesis, rats were given a single tremorgenic (3 mg/kg, IP) dose of aflatrem, and kinetics of amino acid neurotransmitter uptake was assessed in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals at 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks after injection. Results indicate a decrease in the capacity of the GABA and glutamate uptake systems, which was interpreted as a loss of nerve terminals. The affinity constants suggest a decrease in release of these transmitters as well. In addition to its transient influence on transmitter release, a single low dose of aflatrem is able to induce degeneration of neuronal processes in hippocampal neurotransmitter systems and therefore represents a long-term health threat.",

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

In particular, betulinic acid (BA), which is a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenic acid (Figure 1), is commonly isolated from birch (Betula spp.) bark, displaying important biological activities [1,2]. Among triterpenic acids, BA gained special attention from the scientific community from the moment that two of its synthetic derivatives, namely bevirimat (Myriad Genetics) and BMS-955176 (GSK) (Figure 1), were known as efficient anti-HIV drugs, reaching phase IIb clinical trials [3,4]. Meanwhile, GSK pursued its study in the development of HIV maturation inhibitors and produced another interesting molecule with a similar structure to BMS-955176 known as GSK'254 ( Figure 1), which is a phase IIb clinical candidate [5].\n\nBA proved to be an attractive scaffold for chemical upgrading [6], including its functionalization with oxygen-and nitrogen-containing heterocycles with very encouraging biological properties, especially as antitumor agents [6][7][8][9].",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Virtual molecules assembled from existing starting material connected by these reactions are supposed to have an enhanced chance to be amenable to real chemical synthesis. About 50% of the reactions in the dataset are ring-forming reactions, which fosters the assembly of novel ring systems and innovative chemotypes. A comparison with a recent survey of the reactions used in early drug discovery revealed considerable overlaps with the collection presented here.

They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human-driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.",

Only a single known reference compound is required to have the computer come up with suggestions for potentially isofunctional molecules.

The de novo design software provides rapid access to tool compounds and starting points for the development of a lead candidate structure. The manuscript gives a detailed description of the algorithm.

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Recently, there has been a revitalization of interest in the inclusion of these chemotypes in compound collections for screening and achieving selective target modulation. Here we discuss natural-product-inspired drug discovery with a focus on recent advances in the design of synthetically tractable small molecules that mimic nature's chemistry. We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in next-generation drug discovery.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity.

With the avalanche of bioinformatics data, de novo design is ideally suited for exploring molecules that could be useful for chemical genomics. The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity.

As databases of chemical space grow ever larger, data mining techniques and algorithms to enable chemists to efficiently explore this space are crucial; for example, algorithms to assess synthetic tractability or analyze structural properties would be tremendously valuable (Hoffmann and Gastreich, 2019). Ideal databases for drug discovery include those that are properly curated, complete with positive and negative data, and replete with examples to capture a wide breadth of existing chemical space. When paired with strong design algorithms, such databases can help researchers identify areas of chemical space yet to be explored and quickly sift through what has already been synthesized and tested.

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug.

After training the data of both molecular representations using the models presented in this paper, a molecule was randomly selected from the test set and 200 samples were taken for each model respectively. The number of valid molecules was also calculated for the model using SMILES, after which similarity was sorted and statistical calculations were performed. We found that the model trained with SELFIES produced 77.5% of diverse molecules, while the model trained with SMILES produced 40.59% of diverse molecules, as shown in Figure 7. The SMILES curve often appears parallel to the horizontal axis, which indicates that the molecules in this part are the same.

To avoid late-stage failure, learnings from past projects and the development of new approaches are crucial. New modalities and emerging new target spaces allow the exploration of unprecedented indications or to address so far undrugable targets. Late-stage attrition is usually attributed to the lack of efficacy or to compound-related safety issues. Efficacy has been shown to be related to a strong genetic link to human disease, a better understanding of the target biology, and the availability of biomarkers to bridge from animals to humans. Compound safety can be improved by ligand optimization, which is becoming increasingly demanding for difficult targets. Therefore, new strategies include the design of allosteric ligands, covalent binders, and other modalities. Design methods currently heavily rely on artificial intelligence and advanced computational methods such as free energy calculations and quantum chemistry. Especially for quantum chemical methods, a more detailed overview is given in this chapter.",

The reality is, however, disconnected from the expectation - US FDA drug approval statistics show that the number of approved drugs, especially the first-in-class drugs, is not commensurate with our improved knowledge. In this perspective, we offer our views on the possible reasons for this, focusing on small-molecule drugs and suggest some ideas for further considerations. ",

In recent decades, machine learning based approaches have been actively studied as efficient alternatives to expedite the molecular design processes. [2][3][4] A conventional approach is to build a prediction model that estimates the properties of a given molecule, as shown in Figure 1(a). Molecules with desired properties are then chosen after screening a possible set of candidate molecules by this prediction model. 5 The candidate molecules for screening need to be manually obtained from such sources as combinatorial enumerations of possible fragments [6][7][8] and public databases. 9,10 It is necessary to secure a sufficient amount of molecules that are properly labeled with properties, as prediction accuracy typically depends on the number of labeled molecules and the quality of the labels.",

To address this limitation, we report GDBChEMBL as a subset of GDB17 featuring 10 million molecules selected according to a ChEMBL-likeness score (CLscore) calculated from the frequency of occurrence of circular substructures in ChEMBL, followed by uniform sampling across molecular size, stereocenters and heteroatoms.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The IUPAC name of okadaic acid is (2R)-2-hydroxy-3-{(2S,5R,6R,8S)-5-hydroxy-[(1R,2E)-3-((2R,5R,6'S,8'R,8a'S)-8'-hydroxy-6'-{(1S,3S)-1-hydroxy-3-[(3R,6S)-3-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undec-2-yl]butyl}-7'-methyleneoctahydro-3H,3'H-spiro[furan-2,2'-pyrano[3,2-b]pyran]-5-yl)-1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl]-10-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undec-10-en-2-yl}-2-methylpropanoic acid. Okadaic acid was named from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai, from which okadaic acid was isolated for the first time. It has also been isolated from another marine sponge, H. malanodocia, as a cytotoxin. The real producer of okadaic acid is a marine dinoflagellate. Okadaic acid has been shown to exhibit anti-tumor, signalling, apoptotic and lipolytic functions  Okadaic acid belongs to the family of Okadaic Acids and Derivatives. These are heat-stable polyether and lipophilic compounds that accumulate in the fatty tissue of shellfish. (A3211, A3212, A3213, A3214).\"]",

The subject of this review is limited to okadaic acid (OA). It was the first example of a group of polyether toxins produced by marine microalgae, which is responsible for the natural phenomena known as Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, DSP red tides. These toxins are accumulated in the digestive glands of the shellfish with a disastrous effect upon the shellfish industry in many parts of the world. Thus, it has been demonstrated that OA is a highly selective inhibitor of protein phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), subsequently that it causes dramatic increases in phosphorylation of numerous proteins as well as being a potent tumour promoter. For that reason, OA is an extremely useful tool for studying the cellular processes that are regulated by reversible phosphorylation of proteins as signal transduction, cell division and memory.",

Knowledge of the correct structures for these toxins is important in understanding their toxicology, biochemistry, and biosynthesis. We have performed extensive NMR analyses on okadaic acid (1), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), and dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2) obtained from natural sources. Consequently, we were able to unambiguously deduce the stereochemistries at C-35 for DTX-1 and DTX-2 based on analysis of NMR coupling constants and NOE interactions. Our results revealed that DTX-2 (3) has a stereochemistry opposite to that of DTX-1 (2) at C-35. Molecular modeling of the docking of 1-3 with protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) suggested that the reduced affinity of DTX-2 for PP2A may be due to the newly defined stereochemistry at the 35-methyl group. The implications of these findings for biosynthesis and toxicology are discussed.",

The natural toxin inhibitors are also known as the okadaic acid class inhibitors (Figures 1-4). Okadaic acid, the causative agent of diarrhetic seafood poisoning [4], was the first of these inhibitors discovered in 1981. It is a marine polyketide initially found from marine sponges Halicondria okadai and Halicondria melanodocia. Cyclic peptides such as microcystins (e.g., microcystin-LR (18)) and nodularins were initially isolated from blue green algae and are potent inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A, but poor PP2B and PP2C inhibitors. Another cyclic peptide motuporin (19), also known as nodularin-V, was isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei gray ( Figure 3) [4]. Both microcystins and motuporin share the rare aminoacid ADDA, which interacts with the hydrophobic groove of PP1. As mentioned earlier several different structural groups can bind PP1 and PP2A, which makes the classification of these inhibitors challenging. The inhibitors can be classified by structure but a valid choice is classification based on PP1/PP2A selectivity. Based on different inhibition studies and screening, a large number of structurally interesting natural products has been identified to bind PP1 and PP2A more or less selectively. The IC 50 values of selected molecules are collected in Table 1, as well as the origin and structural class. From the biological activity data (Table 1) it can be observed that okadaic acid (13), dinophysistoxin (14), cantharidin (15) and its derivative, thyrsiferyl-23-acetate (16), as well as phosphate-bearing inhibitor fostriecin (17) (Figure 2) are selective PP2A inhibitors. Although some common structures such as spiroketal moieties can be identified, the observed PP1 and PP2A differences cannot be adequately explained with the current structure-activity relationship data [6]. However, the binding data of Table 1 indicates that tautomycin (20) (Figure 4) and calyculins show slight PP1 selectivity. Tautomycin was first isolated from",

Uncontrolled inhibition of phosphatase activity by toxic inhibitors can lead to widespread catastrophic effects. Over the past decade, a number of natural product toxins have been identified which specifically and potently inhibit protein phosphatase-1 and -2A. Among these are the cyanobacteria-derived cyclic heptapeptide microcystin-LR and the polyether fatty acid okadaic acid from dinoflagellate sources. The molecular mechanism of the potent inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 by these toxins is becoming clear through insights gathered from diverse sources. These include: 1. Comparison of structural variants of the toxins, 2. Delineating the structural differences between protein phosphatase-1 and -2A accounting for their differing sensitivity to okadaic acid, 3. Determination of the crystal structure of protein phosphatase-1 with microcystin-LR bound and, most recently, 4. Mutagenesis of protein phosphatase-1. Taken together, these data point to a common binding site on protein phosphatase-1 for okadaic acid and microcystin-LR. However, the details of these data suggest that each toxin binds to the common site in a subtly different way, relying on common structural interactions to different degrees. Finally, the insights derived from protein phosphatase-1 may help explain different sensitivities of other protein serine/threonine phosphatases to toxin inhibition due to the high degree of structural conservation among many members of this enzyme family.",

Okadaic acid is one of the causative agents of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) [139] and has also been detected in several different sponges, including the marine sponge Suberites domuncula and the freshwater sponge Lubomirskia baicalensis [140,141]. It remains controversial whether okadaic acid is a symbiont-origin or dietary-derived metabolite, even though the dinoflagellates Prorocentrum lima and P. hoffmannianum have been identified as free-living producers of okadaic acid [142]. Okadaic acid is a highly potent inhibitor against PP1 and PP2A [78,79,81] (see ''Effects of PP2A inhibitors on smooth muscle contraction'' section, above), which are also common and essential enzymes for sponge cells. Indeed, okadaic acid-binding protein 1 (OABP1), exhibiting a phosphatase activity as well as a sequence similarity to PP2A, was isolated from H. okadaii, based on its affinity to okadaic acid [143]. The affinitybased fractionation concurrently afforded OABP2, with lower homology to protein phosphatase. Notably, the pretreatment of the sponge extract with cold acetone was required to detect the affinity of OABP2 to okadaic acid because of the tight binding to endogenous okadaic acid with a dissociation constant (K d ) as low as 1 nM. Konoki et al. [144] successfully expressed recombinant OABP2, which allowed the confirmation of the nM order affinity to okadaic acid [144,145]. Since OABP2 lacks not only phosphatase activity but also sequence similarity to any other proteins, its overall structure, capable of selectively accommodating okadaic acid, attracted keen interest. The X-ray structure of OABP2 in complex with okadaic acid was recently solved, at 1.4 \u00c5 resolution [146]. Remarkably, the overall conformation of OABP2 resembles that of aequorin [147], a Ca 2? -binding photoprotein from Aequorea aequorea, despite the low sequence homology.",

Phosphatases are important modulators of enzyme activity and cell signaling pathways. However, the interactions between the OA/DTX toxins and phosphatases are not fully understood. This study sought to identify phosphatase targets and characterize their structure-activity relationships (SAR) with these algal toxins using a combination of phosphatase activity and cytotoxicity assays. Preliminary screening of 21 human and yeast phosphatases indicated that only three ser/thr PPs (PP2a, PP1, PP5) were inhibited by physiologically saturating concentrations of DTX2 (200 nM). SAR studies employed naturally-isolated OA, DTX1, and DTX2, which vary in degree and/or position of methylation, in addition to synthetic 2-epi-DTX2. OA/DTX analogs induced cytotoxicity and inhibited PP activity with a relatively conserved order of potency: OA = DTX1 \u2265 DTX2 >> 2-epi-DTX. The PPs were also differentially inhibited with sensitivities of PP2a > PP5 > PP1. These findings demonstrate that small variations in OA/DTX toxin structures, particularly at the head region (i.e., C1/C2), result in significant changes in toxicological potency, whereas changes in methylation at C31 and C35 (tail region) only mildly affect potency. In addition to this being the first study to extensively test OA/DTX analogs' activities towards PP5, these data will be helpful for accurately determining toxic equivalence factors (TEFs), facilitating molecular modeling efforts, and developing highly selective phosphatase inhibitors.",

There is a bimetallic groove that accommodates the carboxylate-bearing C3-C12 spiroketal head region of OA/DTX and a distal hydrophobic groove that hosts the terminal C30-C38 tail spiroketal [15,16]. The carboxylic acid head region of OA that binds close to the active site [11,17] appears to be the primary pharmacophore, as structural modifications at C1 and C2 can reduce inhibitory potencies by several orders of magnitude [14,18]. On the other hand, structural and stereochemical modifications within the tail region of OA/DTX have weaker yet still significant effect on binding to the hydrophobic groove with PP2a [17]. Similarly, OA, DTX1, and DTX2 ( Figure 1) each show widely varying effects in mammals despite very small variations in their molecular structure [19]. produced by dinoflagellates in the genera Dinophysis and Prorocentrum [2,3]. The OA/DTX toxins are distributed globally, with thousands of people exposed annually. For the first time, people fell ill during 2011 in the Pacific northwest region of the United States due to consumption of shellfish containing high levels of DTX1 [4,5]. Symptoms of DSP intoxication include rapid onset of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with resolution within a few days [6]. OA has been associated with mutagenic, carcinogenic, and immunosuppressive effects [7]. OA/DTXs are known to reversibly inhibit serine/threonine protein phosphatases (ser/thr PPs; i.e., PP2a, PP1) [8]. Protein phosphorylation is regulated by tightly controlled kinases and phosphatases and plays an essential role in many eukaryotic cellular processes. Phosphatases fall into two classes based on substrate selectivity; the PPs and the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PPs control a plethora of cellular signaling pathways including cell growth [9] and death [10]. Based on the relatively conserved sequence homology among PPs [11], particularly with respect to the catalytic region, other PPs including PP5 [12,13]",

Phosphatases are important modulators of enzyme activity and cell signaling pathways. However, the interactions between the OA/DTX toxins and phosphatases are not fully understood. This study sought to identify phosphatase targets and characterize their structure-activity relationships (SAR) with these algal toxins using a combination of phosphatase activity and cytotoxicity assays. Preliminary screening of 21 human and yeast phosphatases indicated that only three ser/thr PPs (PP2a, PP1, PP5) were inhibited by physiologically saturating concentrations of DTX2 (200 nM). SAR studies employed naturally-isolated OA, DTX1, and DTX2, which vary in degree and/or position of methylation, in addition to synthetic 2-<iepi</i-DTX2. OA/DTX analogs induced cytotoxicity and inhibited PP activity with a relatively conserved order of potency: OA = DTX1 \u2265 DTX2 &gt;&gt; 2-<iepi</i-DTX. The PPs were also differentially inhibited with sensitivities of PP2a &gt; PP5 &gt; PP1. These findings demonstrate that small variations in OA/DTX toxin structures, particularly at the head region (i.e., C1/C2), result in significant changes in toxicological potency, whereas changes in methylation at C31 and C35 (tail region) only mildly affect potency. In addition to this being the first study to extensively test OA/DTX analogs' activities towards PP5, these data will be helpful for accurately determining toxic equivalence factors (TEFs), facilitating molecular modeling efforts, and developing highly selective phosphatase inhibitors.",

Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) is a syndrome in humans caused by the ingestion of shellfish contaminated by OA and DTX produced by dinoflagellates in the genera Dinophysis and Prorocentrum [2,3]. The OA/DTX toxins are distributed globally, with thousands of people exposed annually. For the first time, people fell ill during 2011 in the Pacific northwest region of the United States due to consumption of shellfish containing high levels of DTX1 [4,5]. Symptoms of DSP intoxication include rapid onset of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, with resolution within a few days [6]. OA has been associated with mutagenic, carcinogenic, and immunosuppressive effects [7].\n\nOA/DTXs are known to reversibly inhibit serine/threonine protein phosphatases (ser/thr PPs; i.e., PP2a, PP1) [8]. Protein phosphorylation is regulated by tightly controlled kinases and phosphatases and plays an essential role in many eukaryotic cellular processes. Phosphatases fall into two classes based on substrate selectivity; the PPs and the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PPs control a plethora of cellular signaling pathways including cell growth [9] and death [10]. Based on the relatively conserved sequence homology among PPs [11], particularly with respect to the catalytic region, other PPs including PP5 [12,13] appear to be targeted by OA/DTXs in a similar manner [14].",

OA is a potent inhibitor of protein serine/threonine phosphatases (PP) 1 and 2A, and the structural basis of phosphatase inhibition has been well investigated. However, the role and mechanism of OA retention in the marine sponge have remained elusive. We have solved the crystal structure of okadaic acid binding protein 2.1 (OABP2.1) isolated from H. okadai; it has strong affinity for OA and limited sequence homology to other proteins. The structure revealed that OABP2.1 consists of two \u03b1-helical domains, with the OA molecule deeply buried inside the protein. In addition, the global fold of OABP2.1 was unexpectedly similar to that of aequorin, a jellyfish photoprotein. The presence of structural homologues suggested that, by using similar protein scaffolds, marine invertebrates have developed diverse survival systems adapted to their living environments. ",

Detailed studies of their biological effects have been impeded by unavailability of the complex natural product from natural sources. This work describes the development of a robust, scalable synthetic sequence relying on a convergent strategy that delivered a sufficient amount of the toxin for detailed biological studies and its commercialization for use by other research groups and regulatory agencies. A central transformation in the synthesis is the highly diastereoselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangement of a complex \u03b1,\u03b1-disubstituted allylic ester based on a unique mode for stereoselective enolization through a chirality match between the substrate and the lithium amide base. With synthetic pinnatoxin A, a detailed study has been performed that provides conclusive evidence for its mode of action as a potent inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors selective for the human neuronal \u03b17 subtype. The comprehensive electrophysiological, biochemical, and computational studies support the view that the spiroimine subunit of pinnatoxins is critical for blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, as evidenced by analyzing the effect of a synthetic analogue of pinnatoxin A containing an open form of the imine ring. Our studies have paved the way for the production of certified standards to be used for mass-spectrometric determination of these toxins in marine matrices and for the development of tests to detect these toxins in contaminated shellfish.",

The active ingredients can be extracted and purified from natural sources (botanicals, herbal extracts, or animals) but can also be obtained biotechnologically by fermentation and cell cultures or by enzymatic synthesis and modification of natural compounds. A cosmeceutical ingredient should possess an attractive property such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, skin whitening, anti-aging, anti-wrinkling, or photoprotective activity, among others. During the past years, there has been an increased interest on the enzymatic synthesis of bioactive esters and glycosides based on (trans)esterification, (trans)glycosylation, or oxidation reactions. Natural bioactive compounds with exceptional theurapeutic properties and low toxicity may offer a new insight into the design and development of potent and beneficial cosmetics.

Borchardt et al. has shown that the pro-prodrug 3-(2'-acetoxy-4', 6'-dimethyl dimethyl)phenyl-3, 3-dimethylpropionamide is capable of releasing the biologically active amine drug upon acetate hydrolysis by enzyme triggering. Another successful example exploiting a stereopopulation control model is the prodrug Taxol which enhances the drug water solubility and hence affords it to be administered to the human body via intravenous injection. Taxol is the brand name for paclitaxel, a natural diterpene, approved in the USA for use to treat cancer [104-108].\n\n\nComputational methods used in the design of bitterless prodrugs for bitter tastant drugs\n\nNearly sixty five years ago, organic, bioorganic and medicinal chemists alike have started using computational methods for calculating molecular properties of ground and transition states. These computational methods use principles of computer science to aid in solving chemical problems. Theoretical results emerged from these methods, incorporated into efficient computer programs, for calculating the structures and physical and chemical properties of molecules.\n\nEquilibriums energy-based and reactions rates calculations for systems having medicinal interests are of a vast importance to the health community. Today, quantum mechanics (QM) such as ab initio, semi-empirical and density functional theory (DFT), and molecular mechanics (MM) are commonly and increasingly being used and broadly accepted as precise tools for predicting structure-energy calculations for drugs and prodrugs alike [109][110][111][112].",

Many thiazole-based compounds possess a broad spectrum of bioactivities, and some of them are well-known drugs in the markets. The use of thiazole derivatives in other fields such as organic materials, cosmetics, and organic synthesis has also been widely reported. Due to a wide range of applicability, the synthesis of thiazole-containing compounds has attracted extensive interest from chemists, and many studies in the synthesis of thiazole skeleton have been reported recently. This review article will discuss recent studies in the synthesis of thiazoles (from2012). Besides the well-established Hantzsch thiazole synthesis, a large number of novel methods have been developed for the synthesis of thiazole derivatives. In most cases, reaction mechanisms have also been described. The synthesis of thiazole derivatives has drawn great attention from chemists, and many studies in the synthesis of these heterocycles have been reported recently. The classical method, the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis has received great research interest from chemists. Moreover, many new methods have been established to synthesize thiazole-derived compounds. Unquestionably, more and more approaches to access thiazole skeleton will appear in the literature. The application of well-established thiazole synthesis methods to the synthesis of drugs, organic materials, and natural products will almost certainly be studied.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The novel compounds generally have a high molecular weight or a complex molecular structure, more so than those produced by total synthesis from simple starting materials. Semisynthesis is a means of preparing many medicines more cheaply than by total synthesis since fewer chemical steps are necessary. Overview",

In order to handle the vast number of structural possibilities, researchers often create a 'virtual library', a computational enumeration of all possible structures of a given pharmacophore with all available reactants. Such a library can consist of thousands to millions of 'virtual' compounds.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

That is how practical it is to make ML-generated molecules from a given set of commercially available reactants (also called starting molecules). For this purpose, Bradshaw et al [2] proposed to apply a generative model on bags of reactants instead of molecules as in previous approaches. In particular, first, an encoder is to map a set of starting molecules to a continuous vector in the latent space. Second, a decoder is to map the continuous vector back to the set of reactants. As the ultimate goal is to generate molecules, in the generation process, the set of predicted reactants is mapped to a final product molecule through a reaction predictor, named Molecule Transformer [20]. Thus, this model not only generates a molecule with optimized chemical properties, but also suggest a set of known starting molecules that can be used to synthesize it. However, a drawback of this model is the limited diversity of generated molecules as it considered only the products as a result of single-step chemical reactions applied on starting molecules, while most natural product molecules are often resulted from multi-step chemical reactions. Concurrent to our work, Bradshaw et al [3] proposed to generate molecules via multi-step synthesis and formalizing a multi-step reaction synthesis as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, their method was based on an additional reaction predictor, which might generate imaginary product molecules. Our method, on the other hand, focuses on chemical reaction trees, for which we generate reaction templates and molecules alternatively.\n\n\nProposed method",

Earlier approaches, like the structural classification of natural products (SCONP) and biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), focus on the identification of activity determining scaffolds and the synthesis of corresponding compound collections. More recently, NP fragments identified by means of cheminformatic analysis of the Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP) have been combined in unprecedented fashions to yield pseudo natural products (pseudo NPs), which show biological activities unrelated to the guiding NPs.

The pseudo-natural product concept merges the relevance of natural product structure with efficient exploration of chemical space by means of fragment-based compound development to inspire the discovery of new bioactive chemical matter through <ide novo</i combination of natural product fragments in unprecedented arrangements. The novel scaffolds retain the biological relevance of natural products but are not obtainable through known biosynthetic pathways which can lead to new chemotypes that may have unexpected or unprecedented bioactivities. Herein, we cover the workflow of pseudo-natural product design and development, highlight recent examples, and discuss a cheminformatic analysis in which a significant portion of biologically active synthetic compounds were found to be pseudo-natural products.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance.

Only molecular fragments that were predicted to enhance the trypanocidal activity (red areas of the contribution maps) were considered in this analysis. Next, physicochemical descriptors were calculated for these fragments and used as an input for the best ANN with the view of predicting their biological activity. Finally, the predicted activity values were correlated with each physicochemical property of the fragment collection. The outcome of this analysis is illustrated as heat maps (Figures 8-10), which allowed us to identify a specific physicochemical space that favors trypanocidal activity. The heat maps also correlate the activity of the compounds from which the fragments were extracted and their physicochemical profile. Figure 8 shows the heat maps for MW, aLogP, HBD, and HBA. Fragments with MW greater than 260 Da were predicted to be the most active (pIC 50 > 6). For aLogP, the most active fragments had values predominantly between 2 and 3. Fragments with 0-1 HBD and 1-6 HBAs were predicted to have the highest pIC 50 values. Figure 9 illustrates the heat maps for HAC, RB, RC, and PSA. As shown in the figure, fragments with HAC values greater than 20 had the highest pIC 50 values. For RB, fragments with two to eight rotatable bonds were the most active. According to the heat maps, fragments with RC values from 2 to 3 were predicted to have the best anti-T. cruzi profile. Finally, fragments with polar surface area (PSA) predominantly between 50 and 80 \u00c5 2 had the highest pIC 50 values. Figure 10 shows the heat maps for E-state, MR, and Polar. The ANN predicted the fragments with E-state values between 35 and 63 as being the most active. Fragments with MR ranging from 65 to 115 were predicted to have the highest pIC 50 values. Finally, the Polar descriptor was demonstrated to have optimal values ranging from 30 to 53.   Figure 11 shows the structure and biological activity of 35 fragments that were predicted to be the most promising according to their trypanocidal profile.

Paul Ehrlich, whose studies initiated the field of chemotherapy, was one of the major contributors. From early experiments on the efficacy of the biological stain methylene blue as an anti-malarial, Ehrlich realized that small molecules could be used to treat infections. Further studies identified trypan dyes and arsenical compounds as treatments of trypanosomal infection, and the arsenical compounds were found to be effective against syphilis. Ehrlich's experience of the chemical industry, in particular the chemistry of dyes, led to the realization that synthetic molecules could be medically useful and provided a powerful stimulus to pharmaceutical research.",

Exploratory data analysis, Hansch approach and VolSurf formalism were applied to aid the ligand-based design of novel anti-T. cruzi agents. The best 2D-QSAR model showed suitable statistical measures [n = 18; s = 0.11; F = 42.19; R(2) = 0.90 and Q(2) = 0.77 (SDEP = 0.15)], and according to the optimum 3D-QSAR model [R(2) = 0.98, Q(2) = 0.93 (SDEP = 0.08)], three latent variables explained 62% of the total variance from original data. Steric and hydrophobic properties were pointed out as the key for biological activity. Based upon the findings, six novel benzofuroxan derivatives (4u-z) were designed, synthesized, and in vitro assayed to perform the QSAR external prediction. Then, the predictability for the both models, 2D-QSAR (Rpred(2) = 0.91) and 3D-QSAR (Rpred(2) = 0.77), was experimentally validated, and compound 4u was identified as the most active anti-T. cruzi hit (IC50 = 3.04 \u03bcM).",

Only molecular fragments that were predicted to enhance the trypanocidal activity (red areas of the contribution maps) were considered in this analysis. Next, physicochemical descriptors were calculated for these fragments and used as an input for the best ANN with the view of predicting their biological activity. Finally, the predicted activity values were correlated with each physicochemical property of the fragment collection. The outcome of this analysis is illustrated as heat maps (Figures 8-10), which allowed us to identify a specific physicochemical space that favors trypanocidal activity. The heat maps also correlate the activity of the compounds from which the fragments were extracted and their physicochemical profile. Figure 8 shows the heat maps for MW, aLogP, HBD, and HBA. Fragments with MW greater than 260 Da were predicted to be the most active (pIC50 > 6). For aLogP, the most active fragments had values predominantly between 2 and 3. Fragments with 0-1 HBD and 1-6 HBAs were predicted to have the highest pIC50 values. Figure 9 illustrates the heat maps for HAC, RB, RC, and PSA. As shown in the figure, fragments with HAC values greater than 20 had the highest pIC50 values. For RB, fragments with two to eight rotatable bonds were the most active. According to the heat maps, fragments with RC values from 2 to 3 were predicted to have the best anti-T. cruzi profile. Finally, fragments with polar surface area (PSA) predominantly between 50 and 80 \u00c5 2 had the highest pIC50 values. Figure 10 shows the heat maps for E-state, MR, and Polar. The ANN predicted the fragments with E-state values between 35 and 63 as being the most active. Fragments with MR ranging from 65 to 115 were predicted to have the highest pIC50 values. Finally, the Polar descriptor was demonstrated to have optimal values ranging from 30 to 53.

Though no substitute for the medicinal chemist, AutoGrow 3.0, unlike its predecessors, attempts to introduce some chemical intuition into the automated optimization process. AutoGrow 3.0 uses the rules of click chemistry to guide optimization, greatly enhancing synthesizability. Additionally, the program discards any growing ligand whose physical and chemical properties are not druglike. By carefully crafting chemically feasible druglike molecules, we hope that AutoGrow 3.0 will help supplement the chemist's efforts. To demonstrate the utility of the program, we use AutoGrow 3.0 to generate predicted inhibitors of three important drug targets: Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing ligase 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, and dihydrofolate reductase. In all cases, AutoGrow generates druglike molecules with high predicted binding affinities. AutoGrow 3.0 is available free of charge (http://autogrow.ucsd.edu) under the terms of the GNU General Public License and has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X. ",

To identify new compounds active against Trypanosoma cruzi, we designed and synthesized 46 synthetic derivatives based on the structure of two classes of natural products: tetrahydrofuran lignans (Series 1) and oxazole alkaloids (Series 2). Compounds were screened in vitro using a cellular model of T. cruzi infection. In the first series of compounds, 11 derivatives of hit compound 5 (EC<sub50</sub\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u00a0\u00b5M) were found to be active; the most potent (7, 8, and 13) had EC<sub50</sub values of 5.1-34.2\u00a0\u00b5M. In the second series, 17 analogs were found active at 50\u00a0\u00b5M; the most potent compounds (47, 49, 59, and 63) showed EC<sub50</sub values of 24.2-49.1\u00a0\u00b5M. Active compounds were assessed for selectivity, hemocompatibility, synergistic potential, effects on mitochondrial membrane potential, and inhibitory effect on trypanothione reductase. All active compounds showed low toxicity against uninfected THP-1 cells and human erythrocytes. The potency of compounds 5 and 8 increased steadily in combination with benznidazole, indicating a synergistic effect. Furthermore, compounds 8, 47, 49, 59, and 63 inhibited parasitic mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner. Although increased reactive oxygen species levels might lead to mitochondrial effects, the results indicate that the mechanism of action of the compounds is not dependent on trypanothione reductase inhibition. In silico calculation of chemical descriptors and principal component analysis showed that the active compounds share common chemical features with other trypanocidal molecules and are predicted to have a good ADMET profile. Overall, the results suggest that the compounds are important candidates to be further studied for their potential against T. cruzi.",

However, molecular topology, which relies on topological descriptors, has also shown value for molecular design even if it does not take into account the physical or chemical properties of ligands and receptors, including the ligand-receptor interaction itself. Herein, the authors provide new insights into the importance of molecular topology according to some of the latest discoveries in physics and chemistry. Furthermore, the authors report on the most significant achievements in drug design using molecular topology over the last 5\u00a0years and give their expert perspectives on the subject as a whole. Molecular topology is a new paradigm which is independent of physicochemical molecular descriptors. This fact explains the viability of both the discovery of new lead compounds with a minimum of information derived from mathematical-topological patterns and the interpretation results in structural and physicochemical terms.",

These other molecules may be used to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn may be used to design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived.

The trypanocidal activity of these molecules is expressed as the concentration of the compound that inhibits 50% the growth of T. cruzi in phenotypic assays (IC 50 ). The IC 50 values range from 2 nM to 97.97 \u00b5M (a 48,985-fold activity range) and were converted into pIC 50 values (\u2212log IC 50 ) prior to the QSAR modeling. This wide activity interval follows the broad chemical diversity enclosed in the dataset. The structural and activity landscape covered by the 363 trypanocidal agents is illustrated in Figure 2. In the structure similarity map, the distance among the points is inversely proportional to the structural similarity, and the colors represent different activity ranges (Figure 2A). Based on this map, training and test sets were selected to construct the models. Structurally distinct chemotypes enclosing a wide spectrum of pIC 50 values were included in both the training (280 compounds) and test sets (83 compounds), as depicted in Figure 2B,C. from each atom.

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to",

The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Most of these effects are due to interactions, of varying specificity, between the negatively charged polysaccharide chains and proteins. While such interactions generally involve a single saccharide domain of decasaccharide size or less, ternary complexes of two protein molecules binding to separate domains on a single polysaccharide chain are known to occur. To facilitate studies on domain organization and its importance for biological function a strategy was developed to chemically conjugate defined heparin oligomers in linear and chemoselective fashion. The procedure requires that the oligosaccharide to provide the reducing-terminal domain of the conjugate is generated by lyase degradation of a parent polysaccharide, whereas the nonreducing-terminal domain is obtained through deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by constructing a conjugate composed of two heparin 12-mers, of which the reducing-terminal component contained the antithrombin-binding region, whereas the nonreducing-terminal domain did not. Contrary to any of the unconjugated oligomers, the product was found to efficiently promote the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin.",

They typically arise either from modification of an existing peptide, or by designing similar systems that mimic peptides, such as peptoids and \u03b2-peptides. Irrespective of the approach, the altered chemical structure is designed to advantageously adjust the molecular properties such as stability or biological activity. This can have a role in the development of drug-like compounds from existing peptides. These modifications involve changes to the peptide that will not occur naturally (such as altered backbones and the incorporation of nonnatural amino acids). Based on their similarity with the precursor peptide, peptidomimetics can be grouped into four classes (A \u2013 D) where A features the most and D the least similarities.

In more recent times important developments in theory have led to a different type of modelling becoming possible, the so-called de novo or automated design algorithms. In this new method the programs perform much of the chemist's thinking, in finding appropriately sized chemical groups to fit into a target site. However this is a combinatoric problem which has no general analytical solution; it is ripe for optimization. Other advances, such as combinatorial chemical synthesis and screening, will dramatically influence the search for new lead structures for target sites, which at present are poorly understood. Already these methods are being applied to peptide libraries. Peptides do not make good drug compounds because of their poor bioavailability; further, their flexibility reduces their affinity. In some cases peptide backbones can be removed and replaced with rigid non-peptide scaffolds.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Rather than being directed toward a single biological target, DOS libraries can be used to identify new ligands for a variety of targets. Several different strategies for library design have been developed to target the biologically relevant regions of chemical structure space. DOS has provided powerful probes to investigate biological mechanisms and also served as a new driving force for advancing synthetic organic chemistry.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Recently, there has been a revitalization of interest in the inclusion of these chemotypes in compound collections for screening and achieving selective target modulation. Here we discuss natural-product-inspired drug discovery with a focus on recent advances in the design of synthetically tractable small molecules that mimic nature's chemistry. We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in next-generation drug discovery.",

As such, the makeup of screening libraries largely dictates the biological targets that can be modulated and the therapeutics that can be developed. Unfortunately, most compound-screening collections consist principally of planar molecules with little structural or stereochemical complexity, compounds that do not offer the arrangement of chemical functionality necessary for the modulation of many drug targets. Here we describe a novel, general and facile strategy for the creation of diverse compounds with high structural and stereochemical complexity using readily available natural products as synthetic starting points. We show through the evaluation of chemical properties (which include fraction of sp(3) carbons, ClogP and the number of stereogenic centres) that these compounds are significantly more complex and diverse than those in standard screening collections, and we give guidelines for the application of this strategy to any suitable natural product.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

The frequency of the overall similarity coefficient is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the similarity span of molecules generated by the R group model is large, and many of the generated molecules have low similarity, and the number of molecules with research value is small; Most of the molecules generated by this model have a similarity interval of [60%, 90%]. The number of low similarity molecules is very small, and there are many molecules with research value. The test data show that the model in this paper shows good performance in terms of the similarity of the molecules generated from the zinc molecular data set. Figure 6. The molecule generated by the two models is similar to the original molecule In addition to the similarity shown in formation of a single new molecule, the molecular diversity shown in the formation of multiple new molecules is also important because it reflects the density of molecules in the underlying space [31] . The denser the molecules encoded in the potential space, the more kinds of molecules can be decoded, and the better the chemical space can be explored. To verify that SELFIES can increase the molecular density of potential Spaces, we'll use SELFIES and SMILES for experimental verification in this article. After training the data of both molecular representations using the models presented in this paper, a molecule was randomly selected from the test set and 200 samples were taken for each model respectively. The number of valid molecules was also calculated for the model using SMILES, after which similarity was sorted and statistical calculations were performed. We found that the model trained with SELFIES produced 77.5% of diverse molecules, while the model trained with SMILES produced 40.59% of diverse molecules, as shown in Figure 7. The SMILES curve often appears parallel to the horizontal axis, which indicates that the molecules in this part are the same. We shot a few times in parallel, which means that most of the molecules are different.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

That is how practical it is to make ML-generated molecules from a given set of commercially available reactants (also called starting molecules). For this purpose, Bradshaw et al [2] proposed to apply a generative model on bags of reactants instead of molecules as in previous approaches. In particular, first, an encoder is to map a set of starting molecules to a continuous vector in the latent space. Second, a decoder is to map the continuous vector back to the set of reactants. As the ultimate goal is to generate molecules, in the generation process, the set of predicted reactants is mapped to a final product molecule through a reaction predictor, named Molecule Transformer [20]. Thus, this model not only generates a molecule with optimized chemical properties, but also suggest a set of known starting molecules that can be used to synthesize it. However, a drawback of this model is the limited diversity of generated molecules as it considered only the products as a result of single-step chemical reactions applied on starting molecules, while most natural product molecules are often resulted from multi-step chemical reactions. Concurrent to our work, Bradshaw et al [3] proposed to generate molecules via multi-step synthesis and formalizing a multi-step reaction synthesis as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, their method was based on an additional reaction predictor, which might generate imaginary product molecules. Our method, on the other hand, focuses on chemical reaction trees, for which we generate reaction templates and molecules alternatively.\n\n\nProposed method",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

To highlight the improvements of our proposed method, in this section, we focus on the methodologies which adopted generative models to generate small molecules. The common scheme has two parts: 1) encoding: learning to represent molecules by continuous representations which facilitates the prediction and optimization of the chemical properties of interest; 2) decoding: learning to map an optimized continuous representation back to the input molecular graph.\n\nLearning representations based on auto-encoding models Many recent studies highlight the applications of generative models for molecule generation tasks, for instance [9,14,7,11], just to name a few. One typically chooses to use a VAE [13] for this task, where we wish to learn an encoder for mapping a data point x to a latent code z in the continuous latent space, and a decoder for mapping from z back to x. In VAE, the decoder is defined by a likelihood function p G (x|z) and parameterized by a neural network G. A prior distribution, typically normal distribution N (0, I), is imposed on the latent code z and play the role of a regularizer. The posterior distribution is approximated by a variational distribution q E (z|x), which is defined as the encoder and parameterized by another neural network E. The VAE simultaneously learns both the parameters of encoder E and decoder G by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) [13].",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software. The computational approach proved to be suitable for scaffold-hopping from known ligands to novel chemotypes, and for generating bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

Molecules are interpreted as graphs, where atoms are represented as vertices and covalent bonds as edges between vertices (molecular graph). Hydrogen atoms are removed from the graph. Vertices are 'colored' by one of eight pharmacophoric feature types assigned to the corresponding atom (A: hydrogen-bond acceptor, D: hydrogen-bond donor, E: hydrogen-bond donor & acceptor, P: positive charge, N: negative charge, R: aromatic, L: lipophilic, 0: no type; the list of atom type definitions can be found in Table S3 in Text S1, supplementary material). A recursive definition of similarity between compared atoms (''two atoms are similar if their neighbors are similar'') is iteratively employed until the process converges. Parameter a controls the influence of the graph neighborhood, where higher values increase the impact of the neighborhood. Based on calculated atom-pair similarities, an optimal assignment of each atom of the smaller graph to one atom of the larger graph is computed. The assignment maximizes the sum of atom-pair similarities, which gives the overall similarity of the compared molecules. Similarity values are adjusted for compound size by scaling by the number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n\n\nReduced Graph Representation",

Many of these new functions will require binding to small molecules. Is the ability to bind small molecules a property that arises only in response to biological selection or computational design? Or alternatively, is small molecule binding a property of folded proteins that occurs readily amidst collections of unevolved sequences? These questions can be addressed by assessing the binding potential of de novo proteins that are designed to fold into stable structures, but are \"na\u00efve\" in the sense that they (i) share no significant sequence similarity with natural proteins and (ii) were neither selected nor designed to bind small molecules. We chose three na\u00efve proteins from a library of sequences designed to fold into 4-helix bundles and screened for binding to 10,000 compounds displayed on small molecule microarrays. Several binders were identified, and binding was characterized by a series of biophysical assays. Surprisingly, despite the similarity of the three de novo proteins to one another, they exhibit selective ligand binding. These findings demonstrate the potential of novel proteins for molecular recognition and have significant implications for a range of applications in synthetic biology.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

Although these are three new and distinct areas, the insights derived from these studies suggest a reason for the observation that similar drugs do not always bind to a protein in the same manner.",

Here we introduce MORPH, which is a simple software tool for systematically modifying aromatic rings in three-dimensional models of molecules without altering the coordinates of the nonhydrogen atoms in the rings. MORPH works on individual rings as well as fused ring systems and additionally provides the ability to filter out modified compounds which do not contain hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors at specific positions on the rings or contain more or less than the desired number of heteroatoms. The MORPH program and its application to two ligands extracted from cocrystal structures with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)/cyclin A and CDK2 are discussed below.",

This discovery was based solely on the single prominent peak on the mass spectrograph, implying a chemically inert substance that was geometrically closed with no dangling bonds. Curl was responsible for determining the optimal conditions of the carbon vapor in the apparatus, and examining the spectrograph. Curl noted that James R. Heath and Sean C. O'Brien deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto. The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this.

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to",

A number of innovative approaches for pursuing this goal have evolved, and the right approach is dictated by the target class being pursued and the capabilities of the organization involved. A recent trend in high-throughput screening has been to place less emphasis on the number of data points that can be produced, and to focus instead on the quality of the data obtained. Several computational and technological advances have aided in the selection of compounds for screening and widened the variety of assay formats available for screening. The effect on the efficiency of the screening process is discussed.",

                    "contents": "The Chemical Basis of PharmacologyIn 1941, the first edition of Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics appeared. Its title revealed a program of research based on the specific modulation of receptors by organic molecules, the behavior of which in the body could be monitored, understood, and exploited. What was then provocative is today so well accepted that the book's title seems antique. At the time, the chemical basis of pharmacology needed no emphasis, so focused was the field on the actions of molecules that were not only its goals but also its primary classifiers and biological informants. Whereas Goodman and Gilman continues to be a central text, the classical pharmacology that it once represented has largely disappeared, as has the chemical view of biology. As primitive as that view remains, the opportunities for its exploitation are clear. The new methods sketched here systematically and comprehensively compare those targets for which ligand information is available. This remains a blinkered perspective, requiring preexisting ligand information, and so it retains some of the frustrations of classical pharmacology that made that field so receptive to the molecular biology wave that broke upon it in the mid-1980s. In its favor, the chemical view retains the integrationist program implicit in classical pharmacology. Classical pharmacologists often worked on whole organs and were systems biologists avant la lettre. As cipherlike as organic molecules can seem as information carriers, they can report on the similarities of pathways and systems as easily as individual receptors. What is new in the past few years is the quantitative restatement of classical ideas, allowing formal comparisons among targets and ligands at a scale not previously attempted. This has suggested unexpected relationships among receptors, identified targets active in phenotypic screens (58), and predicted off-targets and new disease indications for drugs (40). The new techniques remain largely the domain of specialists, but at least some of them are accessible to general investigators interested in bringing new chemical tools to targets and systems of vital interest to themselves (see, for instance, http://sea.bkslab.org).\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe thank Bryan Roth and Randy Peterson for insightful conversations and collaboration in the experimental part of our research program.

The new chiral carbon is produced with both stereochemistries, so the product of a Kiliani\u2013Fischer synthesis is a mixture of two diastereomeric sugars, called epimers. For example, D-arabinose is converted to a mixture of D-glucose and D-mannose.",

Despite increasing knowledge about the molecular and functional characteristics of allergens that have been identified, we still do not fully understand why some proteins are clinically relevant allergens and most are not. Different approaches have been taken to identify the structural and functional features of allergens, aiming at developing methods to predict allergenicity and thus to identify allergens. However, none of these methods has allowed a reliable discrimination between allergenic and nonallergenic compounds on its own. This review sums up diverse determinants that contribute to the phenomenon of allergenicity and outlines that in addition to the structure and function of the allergen, factors derived from allergen carriers, the environment, and the susceptible individual are of importance.",

Personalized Medicine, a medical procedure that separates patients into different groups with different medical decisions, practices and interventions has sanctioned this change. In fact, in the last few years molecular allergology and the observation that not every patient has the same allergic profile, even when allergic to the same allergenic source, has originated the concept \"one size does not fit all\". This new approach requires the identification of still unknown allergens, but also the more detailed investigation of those already known. In depth studies of the structure-function relationships in allergenic molecules can reveal the structural determinants involved in the IgE-binding. Then, the knowledge of the epitope profile of each allergen and of the environmental/experimental conditions affecting the exposure of IgE-binding epitopes can provide important contributions to the understanding of cross-reaction processes and to the improvement of diagnosis, immunotherapy and the overall patient treatment. The evolution of diagnostic systems cannot ignore these new needs in this field.",

Prior to allergen isolation and characterization, adequate source material must first be identified. Most allergens that have been isolated are in the molecular weight range of 15,000 to 40,000 daltons and appear to be proteins or glycoproteins with acidic isoelectric points. A number of laboratory techniques have been shown to be extremely useful in identifying offending allergens and quantitating them in complex allergen extracts. Recently developed in vitro methods such as Western blotting, immunoprinting, and production of monoclonal antibodies to specific allergens will provide useful information for future analysis and standardization of allergen extracts. The effects of new technology on future developments in allergen characterization are far reaching. An important area of molecular biology that has only begun to be used in allergen research is the ability to clone and sequence DNA which codes for specific allergens. This facilitates the production of specific quantities of purified allergens provides material to determine their amino acid sequence, and allows production of standardized allergen preparations.

Its stated aim was to standardize the names given to the antigens (allergens) that caused IgE-mediated allergies in humans. The Sub-Committee first published a revised list of allergen names in 1986, which continued to grow with rare publications until 1994. Between 1994 and 2007 the database was a text table online, then converted to a more readily updated website. The allergen list became the Allergen Nomenclature database (www.allergen.org), which currently includes approximately 880 proteins from a wide variety of sources. The Sub-Committee includes experts on clinical and molecular allergology. They review submissions of allergen candidates, using evidence-based criteria developed by the Sub-Committee. The review process assesses the biochemical analysis and the proof of allergenicity submitted, and aims to assign allergen names prior to publication. The Sub-Committee maintains and revises the database, and addresses continuous challenges as new \"omics\" technologies provide increasing data about potential new allergens.

The determination of allergen-reactive patterns in patients will be performed with panels of tracer allergens being produced by molecular biology techniques. Such recombinant allergen proteins can in principal also be used for specific immunotherapy. Undesired biological properties of allergens can be removed by directed mutagenesis. Because recombinant allergens can bind IgE only selectively, T-cell activating fragments thereof may be employed. This may lead to fully artificial protein constructs consisting of immunogenic and allergy-suppressing parts. A different possible way is the therapeutic use of immunologically active proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies or soluble receptors, which suppress IL-4 and/or IgE synthesis. The accessibility of these proteins will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the development of allergy. At the end of this development one could conceive the construction of low molecular chemical agents, drugs in the classical sense, able to regulate IgE synthesis. Of highest significance will be the establishment of genetic markers for atopy and allergy. Such genes may not only indicate a genetic predisposition for the disease but also open an immense spectrum of new diagnostic and therapeutic applications in allergy.",

Initially, allergens were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins in eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems. Crystallization of the purified proteins led to the elucidation of the tertiary structure of the allergen. Molecular biology techniques were used to construct modified allergens whose new IgE binding properties were studied. IgE antibody mapping combined with molecular modeling has allowed the recognition of IgE binding sites on the surface of the molecule. This information has been applied to the engineering of new modified allergens, with and without adjuvants, that retain immunogenicity but with reduced allergenicity.

Protecting group patterns must be designed to achieve the desired connectivity and stereoselectivity in high yield. In addition, the nature of the protecting group can directly influence the reactivity of the building block, affecting reaction times and yield.\n\nThe basic features of a building block are highlighted in Figure 7 and include the anomeric leaving group (LG), a participating group (for 1,2-trans linkages) or nonparticipating group (for 1,2-cis linkages) at the C2 position (R 1 ), temporary protecting groups that are stable under glycosylation conditions but readily removed for the next glycosylation reaction (R 2 ) and permanent protecting groups that remain intact until the final global deprotection step (R 3 ).\n\nMammalian carbohydrates are commonly comprised of ten monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, mannose, sialic acid, N-acetlyglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, and xylose ( Figure 8). In principle, each carbohydrate residue can be linked through any of its different functional groups and each linkage generates a new stereocenter. The potential diversity is significant. For example, the number of theoretical structures possible for a hexasaccharide comprised from any one of the ten mammalian monosaccharides is approximately 190 billion! It has been estimated that 224 building blocks would be required to assemble any given mammalian oligosaccharide. 9 However, recent studies have suggested that only 36 building blocks would be required to access approximately 75% of all known mammalian oligosaccharides due to significant overlaps in common connectivities. 10 Thirty of these building blocks are shown in Figure 9 and are ranked by relative abundance in mammalian oligosaccharides.",

The general process is illustrated in Figure 3. Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed. The oligosaccharide can then be functionalized for further study.",

The syntheses of several of these oligosaccharides are presented in Sections 9.05.7.1-9.05.7.10. Examples were chosen for historical purposes as well as to highlight the challenges and complexities of the oligosaccharides prepared using the automation solid-phase oligosaccharide process. The majority of the oligosaccharides synthesized via automated oligosaccharide syntheses were synthesized using either the first-or second-generation automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer. In most cases Merrified resin was used as the solidsupport. Glycosylation reactions typically employ a 'double-coupling' (Figure 11) or 'triple coupling' strategy which involves activating 3 to 5 equivalents of glycosyl donor two or three times with a washing step (to remove unreacted donor and reaction byproducts) in between. This process is employed to ensure complete reaction thereby minimizing deletion sequences which can have a negative impact on the purification of the desired oligosaccharide.\n\n\na-Mannans and a Phytoalexin b-Glucan\n\na-Mannan and b-glucans are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of certain fungi. 2 The first automated solid-phase oligosaccharide syntheses of a-mannan and b-glucan oligosaccharides were reported in 2001 by Seeberger and co-workers using the first-generation automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer. 1 The syntheses of these compounds provided proof of principle that linear and branched oligosaccharides could be made in automation in high yield using standard LGs such as glycosyl imidates and phosphates.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

In addition to providing detailed insights into the origins of molecular activity, theoretical calculations can be used to design new molecules with specific properties. This article describes two types of calculations that show special promise as design tools, the thermodynamic cycle-perturbation method and the Brownian reactive dynamics method. These methods can be applied to calculate equilibrium and rate constants that describe many aspects of molecular recognition, stability, and reactivity.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

If a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds, it is considered a purely synthetic process. If it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to new compounds, the synthesis is described as a semisynthetic process.",

Among the tens of thousands of organic reactions that are known, hundreds of such reactions are well-known enough to be named after people. Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

PILLI and FRANCISCO F. DE ASSIS investigation, to invent new methodologies as well to contribute to fundamental and applied knowledge, underpinning our social and economical progress with the discovery of new drugs, contributing to food supply, providing new polymers and materials with novel properties and functions with a direct impact on the welfare of the world population.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Based on this hypothetical biosynthetic pathway, a laboratory synthesis was designed that incorporated as a key transformation the novel one-pot transformation of dialdehyde 24 to pentacyclic unsaturated amine 25. This process turned out to be an exceptionally efficient way to construct the pentacyclic nucleus of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids.

Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

That is how practical it is to make ML-generated molecules from a given set of commercially available reactants (also called starting molecules). For this purpose, Bradshaw et al [2] proposed to apply a generative model on bags of reactants instead of molecules as in previous approaches. In particular, first, an encoder is to map a set of starting molecules to a continuous vector in the latent space. Second, a decoder is to map the continuous vector back to the set of reactants. As the ultimate goal is to generate molecules, in the generation process, the set of predicted reactants is mapped to a final product molecule through a reaction predictor, named Molecule Transformer [20]. Thus, this model not only generates a molecule with optimized chemical properties, but also suggest a set of known starting molecules that can be used to synthesize it. However, a drawback of this model is the limited diversity of generated molecules as it considered only the products as a result of single-step chemical reactions applied on starting molecules, while most natural product molecules are often resulted from multi-step chemical reactions. Concurrent to our work, Bradshaw et al [3] proposed to generate molecules via multi-step synthesis and formalizing a multi-step reaction synthesis as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, their method was based on an additional reaction predictor, which might generate imaginary product molecules. Our method, on the other hand, focuses on chemical reaction trees, for which we generate reaction templates and molecules alternatively.\n\n\nProposed method",

It is a daunting task to balance the generation of new molecules with limitations on growth that produce desired features such as stability in water, synthetic accessibility, or drug-likeness. We have developed an algorithm, Fragment Optimized Growth (FOG), which statistically biases the growth of molecules with desired features. At the heart of the algorithm is a Markov Chain which adds fragments to the nascent molecule in a biased manner, depending on the frequency of specific fragment-fragment connections in the database of chemicals it was trained on. We show that in addition to generating synthetically feasible molecules, it can be trained to grow new molecules that resemble desired classes of molecules such as drugs, natural products, and diversity-oriented synthetic products. In order to classify our grown molecules, we developed the Topology Classifier (TopClass) algorithm that is capable of classifying compounds, for example as drugs or nondrugs. The classification accuracies obtained with TopClass compare favorably with the literature. Furthermore, in contrast to \"black-box\" approaches such as Neural Networks, TopClass brings to light characteristics of drugs that distinguish them from nondrugs.",

For machines to discover novel molecules, they must first be trained to sort through the many characteristics of molecules and determine which properties should be retained, suppressed, or enhanced to optimize functions of interest. Machines need to be able to understand, read, write, and eventually create new molecules. Today, this creative process relies on deep generative models, which have gained popularity since powerful deep neural networks were introduced to generative model frameworks. In recent years, they have demonstrated excellent ability to model complex distribution of real-word data (<ie.g.</i, images, audio, text, molecules, and biological sequences). Deep generative models can generate data beyond those provided in training samples, thus yielding an efficient and rapid tool for exploring the massive search space of high-dimensional data such as DNA/protein sequences and facilitating the design of biomolecules with desired functions. Here, we review the emerging field of deep generative models applied to peptide science. In particular, we discuss several popular deep generative model frameworks as well as their applications to generate peptides with various kinds of properties (<ie.g.</i, antimicrobial, anticancer, cell penetration, <ietc</i).

Our method specifies the \"binary patterning\" of polar and nonpolar amino acids, but allows combinatorial diversity of amino acid side chains at each polar and nonpolar site in the sequence. Protein design by binary patterning is based on the premise that the appropriate arrangement of polar and nonpolar residues can direct a polypeptide chain to fold into amphipathic elements of secondary structures, which anneal together to form a desired tertiary structure. A designed binary pattern exploits the periodicities inherent in protein secondary structure, while allowing the identity of the side chain at each polar and non-polar position to be varied combinatorially.

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

The ability to endow genomes with novel properties offers special promise for addressing questions not easily approachable with conventional gene-at-a-time methods. These include questions about evolution and about how genomes are fundamentally wired informationally, metabolically, and genetically. The techniques and technologies relating to how to design, build, and deliver big DNA at the genome scale are reviewed here.

The frequency of the overall similarity coefficient is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the similarity span of molecules generated by the R group model is large, and many of the generated molecules have low similarity, and the number of molecules with research value is small; Most of the molecules generated by this model have a similarity interval of [60%, 90%]. The number of low similarity molecules is very small, and there are many molecules with research value. The test data show that the model in this paper shows good performance in terms of the similarity of the molecules generated from the zinc molecular data set. Figure 6. The molecule generated by the two models is similar to the original molecule In addition to the similarity shown in formation of a single new molecule, the molecular diversity shown in the formation of multiple new molecules is also important because it reflects the density of molecules in the underlying space [31] . The denser the molecules encoded in the potential space, the more kinds of molecules can be decoded, and the better the chemical space can be explored. To verify that SELFIES can increase the molecular density of potential Spaces, we'll use SELFIES and SMILES for experimental verification in this article. After training the data of both molecular representations using the models presented in this paper, a molecule was randomly selected from the test set and 200 samples were taken for each model respectively. The number of valid molecules was also calculated for the model using SMILES, after which similarity was sorted and statistical calculations were performed. We found that the model trained with SELFIES produced 77.5% of diverse molecules, while the model trained with SMILES produced 40.59% of diverse molecules, as shown in Figure 7. The SMILES curve often appears parallel to the horizontal axis, which indicates that the molecules in this part are the same.

We also differentiate between the synthesizability of the different best molecules found by the hatching on the bar, differentiating between three different cases: (1) the best molecule found (regardless of synthesizability) is shown with a circular hatched bar, (2) the best molecule found with a synthetic route with the diagonally hatched bar, and (3) the best molecule found which has a synthetic score greater than or equal to 0.9 is given a solid bar.

The dotted gray line for each task represents the score one obtains if picking the best molecule in the training set.        5] we found that our approach was able to obtain very high scoring molecules quite easily, which meant that this score was less useful in investigating the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

Although the number of possible protein sequences is vast, growing exponentially with the size of the protein chain, only a subset of them will fold reliably and quickly to one native state. Protein design involves identifying novel sequences within this subset. The native state of a protein is the conformational free energy minimum for the chain. Thus, protein design is the search for sequences that have the chosen structure as a free energy minimum. In a sense, it is the reverse of protein structure prediction. In design, a tertiary structure is specified, and a sequence that will fold to it is identified. Hence, it is also termed inverse folding. Protein design is then an optimization problem: using some scoring criteria, an optimized sequence that will fold to the desired structure is chosen.",

The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly.

Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes.

Recently, there has been progress in rational design of protein molecules, and a lot of attempts have been made to create proteins with functions of our interests. The key to the progress is the development of methods for controlling desired protein tertiary structures with atomic-level accuracy. A theory for protein folding, the consistency principle, proposed by Nobuhiro Go in 1983, was a compass for the development. Anfinsen hypothesized that proteins fold into the free energy minimum structures, but Go further considered that local and non-local interactions in the free energy minimum structures are consistent with each other. Guided by the principle, we proposed a set of rules for designing ideal protein structures stabilized by consistent local and non-local interactions. The rules made possible designs of amino acid sequences with funnel-shaped energy landscapes toward our desired target structures. So far, various protein structures have been created using the rules, which demonstrates significance of our rules as intended. In this review, we briefly describe how the consistency principle impacts on our efforts for developing the design technology.",

In this new method the programs perform much of the chemist's thinking, in finding appropriately sized chemical groups to fit into a target site.

Other advances, such as combinatorial chemical synthesis and screening, will dramatically influence the search for new lead structures for target sites, which at present are poorly understood.

Our goal is an objective, quantitative design algorithm that is based on the physical properties that determine protein structure and stability and which is not limited to specific folds or motifs. We chose the betabetaalpha motif typified by the zinc finger DNA binding module to test our design methodology. Using previously published sequence scoring functions developed with a combined experimental and computational approach and the Dead-End Elimination theorem to search for the optimal sequence, we designed 20 out of 28 positions in the test motif. The resulting sequence has less than 40% homology to any known sequence and does not contain any metal binding sites or cysteine residues. The resulting peptide, pda8d, is highly soluble and monomeric and circular dichroism measurements showed it to be folded with a weakly cooperative thermal unfolding transition. The NMR solution structure of pda8d was solved and shows that it is well-defined with a backbone ensemble rms deviation of 0. 55 A. Pda8d folds into the desired betabetaalpha motif with well-defined elements of secondary structure and tertiary organization. Superposition of the pda8d backbone to the design target is excellent, with an atomic rms deviation of 1.04 A.",

Proteins are computationally designed from the level of amino acids to the level of a functional protein complex. Design targets range from increased thermo- (or other) stability to specific requested reactions such as protein-protein binding, enzymatic reactions, or nanotechnology applications. The design scheme may encompass small regions of the proteins or the entire protein. In either case, the design may aim at the side-chains or at the full backbone conformation. Herein, the main framework for the process is outlined highlighting key elements in the CPD iterative cycle. These include the very definition of CPD, the diverse goals of CPD, components of the CPD protocol, methods for searching sequence and structure space, scoring functions, and augmenting the CPD with other optimization tools. Taken together, this chapter aims to introduce the framework of CPD.",

Indeed, with single-domain proteins as targets, it has been possible to design proteins that adopt the desired global fold. Yet, designed proteins with well defined structures and properties that mimic those of natural proteins remain elusive. Recent efforts in protein design have been directed toward addressing the basis for non-native characteristics in most protein designs. Although it is clear that specific tertiary interactions between all residues in a protein contribute to the final folded state, much attention has been placed on optimizing the packing of side chains in the hydrophobic core, with substantial success.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself.

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesIn 2006, La Clair 64 reported the first total synthesis of the originally proposed structure of hexacyclinol (134), claiming excellent agreement between the NMR data of synthetic sample and the natural product.The 37-step synthesis (not discussed in this review) involved several challenging steps, and allowed to obtain 3.6 g of the natural product.Such impressive results, coupled with the doubtful stability of the endo-peroxide present in 134, generated some skepticism among the scientific community.A few months after La Clair's publication, Scott Rychnovsky 65 challenged the structure of hexacyclinol by computational means in a seminal work on the use of quantum calculations of NMR shifts in structural elucidation.The NMR shifts of the originally proposed structure was carried out at the mPW1PW91/6-31G**//HF/3-21G level of theory (previously validated with related known compounds) and a significantly poor match between experimental and calculated values was noticed, with several carbons showing errors higher than 10 ppm.Such poor correlation suggested that the proposed structure was in error, though the real identity of hexacyclinol had to be solved.To make progress in this regard, Rychnovsky 65 became interested in panepophenanthrin (135), isolated in 2002 from a different strain of Panus rudis, 66 and synthesized by several research groups. 67Despite the ring systems of 134 and 135 bear no relationship, both display similar functional groups, molecular weights and biological source.Since hexacyclinol was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with methanol, Rychnovsky 65 envisioned that 188 might be an isolation artifact from the acid-promoted decomposition of panepophenanthrin (135), as shown in Scheme 16.In addition, the NMR calculations carried out with structure 138 showed very nice agreement with the experimental NMR data of the natural product, strengthening Rychnovsky's proposal. 65n the meantime, Rychnovsky teamed up with Porco and co-workers (which had previously synthesized panepophenanthrin), 67 to experimentally prove this structural hypothesis. 68Unfortunately, treatment of synthetic 135 under a variety of acidic conditions did not lead to any observable conversion towards 138, suggesting that the hemiacetal structure of 135 might lock the dimeric framework, preventing further ring opening events.Hence, the authors revised their synthetic route",

Over the course of 11 days, the team studied and determined its structure and named it buckminsterfullerene after noting its similarity to the geodesic domes for which the architect Buckminster Fuller was known. This discovery was based solely on the single prominent peak on the mass spectrograph, implying a chemically inert substance that was geometrically closed with no dangling bonds. Curl was responsible for determining the optimal conditions of the carbon vapor in the apparatus, and examining the spectrograph. Curl noted that James R. Heath and Sean C. O'Brien deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto. The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this. Later experiments confirmed their proposed structure, and the team moved on to synthesize",

Among the tens of thousands of organic reactions that are known, hundreds of such reactions are well-known enough to be named after people. Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

A wide variety of randomized clinical trials have shown the drug to have a clinically beneficial effect on asthma comparable to fluticasone propionate, and to permit the reduction or withdrawal of oral glucocorticoid therapy in patients with asthma. Mometasone furoate has approximately 1% oral bioavailability but does produce systemic glucocorticoid effects from the drug released from the lung and its metabolites.

Even if the therapeutic index of this class increased significantly with the introduction of newer corticosteroids, and even if new therapeutic potentials are beginning to emerge with our increasing understanding of the mechanisms of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rhinitis, corticosteroid development still remains a very important field for drug designers. After a brief review of issues related to the structure-activity relationships of glucocorticoids and the main determinants of their receptor-binding affinity at the glucocorticoid receptor, the main focus of the present article will be on the development of soft corticosteroids, as they are particularly well suited to separate local activity from systemic side effects, which still is an important issue for ICSs. Design consideration required in the search for safe and effective soft drugs on one hand, and safe and effective ICSs on the other hand, will be briefly discussed and illustrated with a number of cases, in particular, with that of loteprednol etabonate and etiprednol dicloacetate, soft corticosteroids that are being developed for a full spectrum of therapeutic applications including asthma and allergic rhinitis.",

The most common use of glucocorticoids today is in the treatment of asthma. Inhaled glucocorticoids are first-line treatment in adults and children with persistent asthma, the most common chronic airway inflammatory disease. Our knowledge of how glucocorticoids suppress inflammation is based on recent developments in understanding the fundamental mechanisms of gene transcription, namely recruitment of histone-modifying co-factors. The determination of the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has advanced our understanding of how ligands interact with GR and provide a glimpse of a future of rational drug design based on \"space-filling\" structures with dissociated properties. This might have important clinical implications, leading to a better understanding of the inflammatory mechanisms of many diseases and might signal the development of new anti-inflammatory treatments in the future.",

In doing this, they learned how certain chemical functional groups affected efficacy and safety negatively and positively. When the more promising systemic glucocorticoids were subsequently applied topically, the skin barrier impaired their activity. This led to new research, this time employing in vitro percutaneous absorption evaluations coupled with in vivo vasoconstrictor studies, to screen and develop effective new topical delivery systems. A subsequent stage of this glucocorticoid research revealed that these molecules had to \"fit\" into receptor sites and the approximate spatial structure of such receptor sites. It also disclosed the way that the various chemical functional groups affected that \"fit\" and the resulting effect upon safety and efficacy.",

In recent years, increased understanding of corticosteroid and glucocorticoid receptor pharmacology has enabled the development of molecules designed specifically to achieve potent, localized activity with minimal risk of systemic exposure. Pharmacologic potency studies using affinity and other assessments have produced similar rank orders of potency, with the most potent being mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and its modification, fluticasone furoate. The furoate and propionate ester side chains render these agents highly lipophilic, which may facilitate their absorption through nasal mucosa and uptake across phospholipid cell membranes. These compounds demonstrate negligible systemic absorption. Systemic absorption rates are higher among the older corticosteroids (flunisolide, beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, and budesonide), which have bioavailabilities in the range of 34-49%. Studies, including 1-year studies with mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and budesonide that evaluated potential systemic effects of INSs in children have generally found no adverse effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function or growth. Clinical data suggest no significant differences in efficacy between the INSs.

Recent randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials have assessed the efficacy of mometasone furoate delivered by dry powder inhaler over 12 weeks in adults and adolescents with mild to severe persistent asthma. Mometasone furoate 200 microg twice daily or 400 microg once daily in the morning or 200 microg once daily in the evening improved lung function, asthma symptom scores and use of rescue medication to a significantly greater extent than placebo in patients who had previously received only short-acting inhaled beta2-adrenoceptor agonists alone as treatment in 3 trials (n = 195 to 306). In studies in 227 to 733 patients with mild to moderate asthma who were receiving ongoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids prior to enrolment, mometasone furoate 100 to 400 microg twice daily was consistently better at improving the above indicators of asthma than placebo. Mometasone furoate 100 to 200 microg twice daily was as effective as beclomethasone dipropionate 200 microg twice daily or budesonide 400 microg twice daily and mometasone furoate 200 microg twice daily was as effective as fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice daily. Mometasone furoate 400 or 800 microg twice daily was also consistently more effective than placebo in reducing oral corticosteroid dosages and improving lung function and asthma symptoms in 132 patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Once daily administration of mometasone furoate 400 microg appears to be as effective at improving indicators of asthma as twice daily administration of 200 microg. Patients receiving mometasone furoate &lt; or =800 microg/day and recipients of placebo experienced a similar overall incidence of adverse events considered to be related to treatment. The most common of these events were oral candidiasis, headache, pharyngitis and dysphonia. Mometasone furoate 100 to 400 microg twice daily, beclomethasone dipropionate 200 microg twice daily, budesonide 400 microg twice daily or fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice daily were similarly tolerated. Inhaled mometasone furoate is well tolerated, with minimal systemic activity and is equally effective when administered as a divided dose or as a single daily dose. Use of the drug can result in a decrease in requirements for oral corticosteroids in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma and is as effective as other inhaled corticosteroids currently used in the treatment of mild to moderate persistent asthma. Thus mometasone furoate is suitable for the control of mild to severe persistent asthma in adults or adolescents.",

On the basis of our previous structural studies, we designed and developed a highly potent glucocorticoid, VSGC12, which showed an improved anti-inflammation activity in both cell-based reporter assays and cytokine inhibition experiments, as well as in a gene expression profiling of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. In a mouse asthma model, VSGC12 delivered a higher efficacy than fluticasone furoate, a leading clinical compound, in many categories including histology and the number of differentiated immune cells. VSGC12 also showed a higher potency than fluticasone furoate in repressing most asthma symptoms. Finally, VSGC12 showed a better side effect profile than fluticasone furoate at their respective effective doses, including better insulin response and less bone loss in an animal model.

RBA is a major determinant of therapeutic potential for corticosteroids, because GRs from different tissues and even from different species seem to be essentially the same. A quantitative analysis of these RBA data obtained from more than sixty structures was performed. Within both generations of soft steroids, good receptor-binding affinity could be achieved with adequate substitution at the sensitive 17alpha or 17beta pharmacophores. For soft steroids that satisfy the main binding criteria at the glucocorticoid receptor, an indicator variable for a structural element (6alpha- or 9alpha-halogenation) and a physicochemical parameter (lipophilicity as measured by log P(o/w)) account for a large portion of the variability in RBA. Following a classical, regression-type analysis, a QSAR model that accounts for close to 80% of the variability in the log RBA data could be built using only these two descriptors.

A computerized database search from January 1, 1966, through July 31, 1998, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIDS and using appropriate indexed terms. Reports dealing with the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids on adrenal gland, growth, bone, skin, and eye, and reports on pharmacology and pharmacokinetics were reviewed where appropriate. Studies were included that contained evaluable data on systemic effects in healthy volunteers as well as in asthmatic children and adults. A statistical meta-analysis using regression was performed for parameters of adrenal suppression in 27 studies. Marked adrenal suppression occurs with high doses of inhaled corticosteroid above 1.5 mg/d (0.75 mg/d for fluticasone propionate), although there is a considerable degree of interindividual susceptibility. Meta-analysis showed significantly greater potency for dose-related adrenal suppression with fluticasone compared with beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, or triamcinolone acetonide, whereas prednisolone and fluticasone propionate were approximately equivalent on a 10:1-mg basis. Inhaled corticosteroids in doses above 1.5 mg/d (0.75 mg/d for fluticasone propionate) may be associated with a significant reduction in bone density, although the risk for osteoporosis may be obviated by post-menopausal estrogen replacement therapy. Although medium-term growth studies showed suppressive effects with 400-microg/d beclomethasone dipropionate, there was no evidence to support any significant effects on final adult height. Long-term, high-dose inhaled corticosteroid exposure increases the risk for posterior subcapsular cataracts, and, to a much lesser degree, the risk for ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Skin bruising is most likely to occur with high-dose exposure, which correlates with the degree of adrenal suppression. All inhaled corticosteroids exhibit dose-related systemic adverse effects, although these are less than with a comparable dose of oral corticosteroids. Metaanalysis shows that fluticasone propionate exhibits greater dose-related systemic bioactivity compared with other available inhaled corticosteroids, particularly at doses above 0.8 mg/d. The long-term systemic burden will be minimized by always trying to achieve the lowest possible maintenance dose that is associated with optimal asthmatic control and quality of life.",

Mometasone furoate, a closely related corticosteroid currently available in an intranasal formulation, is being investigated in an oral inhalation formulation for the treatment of asthma. This article reviews available data on the comparative structure-activity relationships, chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate to assess whether claims of differences in the absolute systemic bioavailability of the 2 compounds are supported by the published literature. Information for this review was identified through a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1966 to the present that contained the term mometasone or fluticasone. The resulting list was narrowed by excluding articles dealing with dermatologic applications. A systematic review was conducted of the identified literature pertaining to the molecular structure, topical potency, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of the 2 agents. Additionally, the pharmacology of the 2 moieties was assessed by a review of the available literature on receptor binding affinity, transactivation and transrepression potency, and inhibition of inflammatory-cell cytokine expression. Based on the available data, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate have similar physicochemical properties and structure-activity relationships. When administered intranasally, mometasone furoate is reported to have comparable relative systemic bioavailability to that of fluticasone propionate (mean plasma area under the curve, 123 pmol x h/L vs 112 pmol x h/L, respectively). When administered as a single dose by dry powder inhaler, orally inhaled fluticasone propionate is reported to have a total systemic bioavailability of approximately 17%, whereas that of mometasone furoate is reported to be &lt; 1%. However, the mometasone furoate bioavailability study that reported the latter value used lower drug doses and a less sensitive assay than the fluticasone propionate bioavailability study. When multiple-dose data were used, mometasone furoate had an estimated 11% systemic bioavailability, similar to that of fluticasone propionate. Inhaled fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate appear to have comparable potential systemic absorption and, based on the total systemic bioavailabilities of the parent compounds, have a low potential for systemic side effects at the recommended clinical doses. However, in the case of mometasone furoate, the contribution of the active metabolites to systemic effects has not been adequately assessed.",

In competition experiments with human lung glucocorticoid receptors we have determined the relative receptor affinities (RRA) of these substances with reference to dexamethasone (RRA = 100). We have discovered that 6beta-OH MF and 9,11-epoxy MF display RRAs of 206 +/- 15 and 220 +/- 22, respectively. This level of activity is similar to that of the clinically used inhaled corticosteroid flunisolide (RRA 180 +/- 11). Furthermore we observed that 9,11-epoxy MF is a chemically reactive metabolite. In recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound.

The high F values of 215.05 and 145.63 for equation (1) and (2), respectively, as well as the low p values of less than 0.0001 for both equations, indicate the statistical significance of the model. Moreover, the insignificances of the lack of fit values with p=0.473 and p=0.359 clearly demonstrate that the model fitted well. These confirm the reliability of this model.\n\nFrom the equations, it is likely that the fact that the release profile of dexamethasone (Y 1 ) was positive linearly depended on the amount of sodium lauryl sulfate, propylene glycol, and DMSO. In contrast, only DMSO affected the release pattern of chlorpheniramine (Y 2 ) in a similar manner. This can be explained by the extremely low solubility of dexamethasone in water (0.1 mg/mL), which led to the help of surfactant (i.e., sodium lauryl sulfate) and organic solvents in its dissolution and penetration through the rabbit skin. 11 On the other hand, chlorpheniramine, which has a water solubility at 160 mg/mL, 1600 times higher than that of dexamethasone, needed only DMSO to pass through the same skin (http://www.hmdb.ca/metabolites/HMDB01944).",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human-driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.",

Up to this point, we've focused on developing some general ideas of organic reactivity, looking at the chemistry of hydrocarbons and alkyl halides, and examining some of the tools used in structural studies. With that background, it's now time to begin a study of the oxygen-containing functional groups that lie at the heart of organic and biological chemistry. We'll look at alcohols in this chapter and move on to carbonyl compounds in Chapters 19 through 23.\n\nAlcohols and phenols can be thought of as organic derivatives of water in which one of water's hydrogens is replaced by an organic group: $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ versus $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{Ar}-\\mathrm{O}-\\mathrm{H}$. In practice, the name alcohol is restricted to\ncompounds that have their - OH group bonded to a saturated, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom, while compounds with their -OH group bonded to a vinylic, $s p^{2}$-hybridized carbon are called enols. We'll look at enols in Chapter 22.\n\n\nAn alcohol\n\n\nA phenol",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

[29] relied on string representations of molecular graphs (SMILES [99]), which although flexible can lead to invalid molecules. Extensions of this approach have therefore investigated representing Ap.-19 molecules with grammars [19, 53], and explicit constrained graph representations or molecular fragments [43-45, 56,\nCode is provided at https://github.com/john-bradshaw/synthesis-dags.\nWe reimplemented the CVAE and GVAE models in PyTorch and found that our implementation is significantly better than [53]'s published results. We believe this is down to being able to take advantage of some of the latest techniques for training these models (for example \u03b2-annealing[2, 35]) as well as hyperparameter tuning.\nNote, like reaction predictors, these tools are imperfect, but still (we believe) offer a sensible current method for evaluating our models.\nAp.-20\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of FundingThis work was supported by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1.

In drug discovery, identifying feasible synthesis routes for drug-like molecules remains a factor that substantially challenges medicinal chemists in making the desired molecules experimentally 3 .

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Cyclization creates a new stereogenic center at the carbonyl-bearing carbon.

However, the inherent complexity of natural biological systems has heretofore precluded generalized application of this approach. Directed evolution, a process which mimics Darwinian selection on a laboratory scale, has allowed significant strides to be made in the field of synthetic biology by allowing rapid identification of desired properties from large libraries of variants. Improvement in biocatalyst activity and stability, engineering of biosynthetic pathways, tuning of functional regulatory systems and logic circuits, and development of desired complex phenotypes in industrial host organisms have all been achieved by way of directed evolution. Here, we review recent contributions of directed evolution to synthetic biology at the protein, pathway, network, and whole cell levels.",

As such, synthetic biology represents a new paradigm for learning about and using biological molecules and data, with applications in basic science, biotechnology, and medicine. This review covers the canonical examples as well as some recent advances in synthetic biology in terms of what we know and what we can learn about the networks underlying biology, and how this endeavor may shape our understanding of living systems.",

By doing so, chemistry can test models that connect molecular structure to behaviour without having to rely on what nature has provided. This creation, known as 'synthesis', began to be applied to living systems in the 1980s as recombinant DNA technologies allowed biologists to deliberately change the molecular structure of the microbes that they studied, and automated chemical synthesis of DNA became widely available to support these activities. The impact of the information that has emerged has made biologists aware of a truism that has long been known in chemistry: synthesis drives discovery and understanding in ways that analysis cannot. Synthetic biology is now setting an ambitious goal: to recreate in artificial systems the emergent properties found in natural biology. By doing so, it is advancing our understanding of the molecular basis of genetics in ways that analysis alone cannot. More practically, it has yielded artificial genetic systems that improve the healthcare of some 400,000 Americans annually. Synthetic biology is now set to take the next step, to create artificial Darwinian systems by direct construction. Supported by the National Science Foundation as part of its Chemical Bonding program, this work cannot help but generate clarity in our understanding of how biological systems work.",

Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system (bound state) composed of two or more atoms. Polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species, i.e., short-lived assemblies (resonances) of electrons and nuclei, such as radicals, molecular ions, Rydberg molecules, transition states, van der Waals complexes, or systems of colliding atoms as in Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.

Many macromolecules are polymers of smaller molecules called monomers. The most common macromolecules in biochemistry are biopolymers (nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates) and large non-polymeric molecules such as lipids, nanogels and macrocycles. Synthetic fibers and experimental materials such as carbon nanotubes are also examples of macromolecules. Definition The term macromolecule (macro- + molecule) was coined by Nobel laureate Hermann Staudinger in the 1920s, although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions high molecular compounds (in excess of 1,000 atoms). At that time the term polymer, as introduced by Berzelius in 1832, had a different meaning from that of today: it simply was another form of isomerism for example with benzene and acetylene and had little to do with size.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

A copy of the descendants of v e will be attached to v in m, and the rest of the nodes in the rule have to match v and above. We call the descendants of v e as expanding nodes and all the other nodes as matching nodes. Example: In Figure 4(a), we present a rule. It has two kinds of nodes. The rule adds the square node (v e ). The circular nodes are the pattern, which must be present in the molecule to apply the rule. In Figure 4(b), we present an application of the rule. The solid tree with three nodes is the initial molecule. The middle node A and its right child B form a pattern, where the rule is applicable. The rule adds a left child with the label A to the middle node. The rule is not applicable at the root A due to pattern mismatch. We naturally extend the definitions related to molecules, including M atch and Copy, to the production rules. Let us formally define the molecule productions using the rules. Let m = (V, M, C, v 0 ) be a molecule and r = (V r , M r , C r , v 0r , v e ) be a production rule. Let d be such that v 0r = ancestor(r, v e , d), i.e., v e is at the depth d in r. Let i be such that C r (v , i) = v 0r for some v \u2208 r. We apply r on m at node v \u2208 m such that C(v, i) = \u22a5. We obtain an expanded molecule as follows.\nLet (V , M , C , v 0 ) = Copy(r, v e ). The expanded molecule is m = (V V , M M , C C {(v, i) \u2192 v 0 }, v 0 ) if M atch(r, v 0r , m , ancestor(m , v 0 , d))",

                    "contents": "Barking up the right tree: an approach to search over molecule synthesis DAGsWhen comparing different molecule generation algorithms, there is always a tradeoff between the coverage of chemical space, and synthesizability, stability, and even to some extent the sensibleness of suggested structures. Synthesizability, stability and the sensibleness depend on the application area, are difficult to define, and can all appear subtle to non-chemists. For example, although we can encode a simple notion of syntactic correctness through valency constraints (for instance having maximally four substituents at a carbon atom), these do not guarantee that a molecule is semantically valid. Semantic validity is not trivial to define, and can be related to stability or the presence of undesirable substructures. For instance, a molecule consisting of a chain of 10 nitrogen atoms with alternating single and double bonds would satisfy valency constraints, but would unlikely be stable; it would decompose or explode immediately! We can view VS as being on one end of this tradeoff between chemical coverage and synthesizability/stability. By using pre-defined virtual libraries, we are limited in chemical coverage but can ensure that all the molecules included are sensible and synthesizable. This for instance is sometimes done by generating the library by iterating over a set of readily available starting materials, and combining them using virtual reaction schemes [14].\n\nInhabiting the other end of this tradeoff, would be a completely unconstrained de novo design algorithm, allowing any connecting bond between any atoms to construct the molecular graph. Although such an algorithm covers every conceivable molecule, it would generate structures not even meeting valency constraints. This can be remedied by the hand-coding of expert rules, e.g.\n\n[58]. However, arguably a more scalable approach was the development of algorithms that constructed molecules through combining together larger, sensible fragments [77] and later algorithms that constructed molecules iteratively by combining together building blocks via virtual reaction schemes [34,95]. However, even with these approaches there is still the problem of how best to search through this action space, a difficult discrete optimization problem, and so these algorithms often resorted to optimizing greedily one-step at a time or using genetic algorithms.",

We believe this is down to being able to take advantage of some of the latest techniques for training these models (for example \u03b2-annealing[2, 35]) as well as hyperparameter tuning.\nNote, like reaction predictors, these tools are imperfect, but still (we believe) offer a sensible current method for evaluating our models.\nAp.-20\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of FundingThis work was supported by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1.

Validity: It assesses whether the molecules generated are realistic or not.Examples of not valid molecules are one with wrong valency configuration or wrong SMILES syntax.\n\n2. Uniqueness: It assesses whether the molecules generated are different from one another or not.\n\n3. Novelty: It assesses whether the molecules generated are different from the ones in the training set or not.\n\n\nNetwork Architecture\n\nOur network was trained on SMILES from ChEMBL database.Since the context is in small molecular generation, hence only SMILES string with less than 120 characters were used.The data was divided into 80% training data and 20% testing data.Bayesian optimization was done to optimize the hyper-parameters like number of hidden layers, activation functions, learning rate etc.\n\nOur model is comprised of an encoder, predictor and decoder networks.The encoder in our network has three bi-GRU layers, flatten layer and a dense layer.The predictor is comprised of a dense layer and three 1D convolutional layers.The latent space dimensions were set to 292.The encoder was fed data from SMILES database after one hot encoding.The encoded data is sampled in the latent space using mean and standard deviation vectors.The latent vector produces new samples after passing through the decoder.The decoder has three uni-GRU layers followed by a dense and flatten layer.",

(2022) 11 , and (ii) a de-duplicated 650M subset of (i).GP-MOLFORMER trained on (i) is referred hereafter GP-MOLFORMER-RAW, while GP-MOLFORMER trained on (ii) is termed as GP-MOLFORMER-CLEAN.Secondly, we analyze the effect of varying the number of generated molecules from 30k to 10B molecules.It should be noted that existing molecular generation benchmarks consider reporting performance metrics for a relatively small 10-30k generations, as those models are designed to target a specific distribution of molecules, e.g., synthetic molecules with biological activity or natural products, and are trained on 1-100M samples 14 .In contrast, GP-MOLFORMER is trained on 650M-1.1BSMILES and the dataset captures the relative abundance of molecules, as well as the presence of the same molecule in different context, as found in chemical databases.",

For each molecule that they describe, the authors present a historical background, photographs of the main protagonists (we also need to know the faces and not only the names of the scientists who spend their lives for the benefit of humanity) and a description of the synthesis of the compound. I was fascinated to learn that salicin (the precursor of aspirin W ) was advocated in ancient Egypt some 3,500 years ago. The ancient Egyptians knew about the beneficial effects of myrtle bark (which contains salicin) on rheumatism and back pain. Similar is the story for the discovery of steroids from Mexican yams. And if you are ready for some mystery and intrigue, read the story of strychnine and how it was used as a poison for murder, along with other alkaloids, such as hemlock, which was used to execute Socrates. The discovery of Taxol W was the result of a major effort in the USA from 1960 to 1981 to identify anticancer ingredients from natural sources (did you know that 110,000 substances from 35,000 plant species were tested?). However, natural compounds are often very difficult to isolate in large quantities from plants. Thus, Taxol's total chemical synthesis (led by the Nicolaou and Holton teams) provided a drug that was much needed. The book appropriately ends with chapters on small molecules and biologics (antiviral agents and vaccines) and their importance in many different genetic diseases. This is the style for all the molecules in the book. You do not need to be a chemist to enjoy and follow the book. I highly recommend this elegant and unique book for every scientist and even for nonscientists with a desire to learn the effects of scientific endeavors in human history. It is a major achievement for the field and rightly so foreworded by two Nobel Prize winners, E.J. Corey and Ryoji Noyori.\n \u00a9 2012 Tsonis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The analysis revealed that of the current most frequently used synthetic reactions, none were discovered within the past 20 years and only two in the 1980s and 1990s (Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig). This suggests an inherent high bar of impact for new synthetic reactions in drug discovery. The most frequently used reactions were amide bond formation, Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, and SNAr reactions, most likely due to commercial availability of reagents, high chemoselectivity, and a pressure on delivery. We show that these practices result in overpopulation of certain types of molecular shapes to the exclusion of others using simple PMI plots. We hope that these results will help catalyze improvements in integration of new synthetic methodologies as well as new library design.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Based on this hypothetical biosynthetic pathway, a laboratory synthesis was designed that incorporated as a key transformation the novel one-pot transformation of dialdehyde 24 to pentacyclic unsaturated amine 25. This process turned out to be an exceptionally efficient way to construct the pentacyclic nucleus of the Daphniphyllum alkaloids.

Generally ureas are colorless crystalline solids, which, owing to the presence of fewer hydrogen bonds, exhibit melting points lower than that of urea itself. Synthesis Ureas can be prepared many methods, but rarely by direct carbonation, which is the route to urea itself. Instead, methods can be classified according those that assemble the urea functionality and those that start with preformed urea.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

However, the scaffold diversity of the library is even more striking at higher levels of the hierarchy. This scaffold tree, like that of natural products, [3] is dominated by the three classes of cyclic compounds: azacycles, oxacycles, and carbacycles. There are 25 parental scaffolds in total, and all ring sizes from 5 to 15 (except 10) are represented at this level. The parental scaffolds are related to 54 \"daughter\" scaffolds, which are ultimately related to the 84 molecular scaffolds in the library. At all levels of hierarchy, the scaffolds represented had unprecedented diversity. Furthermore, around 65 % of the deprotected scaffolds are not found in molecules that have been previously prepared.\n\nOur synthetic approach allowed the systematic exploration of chemical space defined by scores of different molecular scaffolds. Each final compound was prepared from the building blocks in either four or five steps. Column chromatography was avoided at all intermediate stages, facilitating the application of the approach in parallel format. Remarkably, our approach used combinations of just six reaction types: the Mitsunobu reaction, silaketal formation, esterification, deacetylation, metathesis, and desilylation. The ethos of DOS was firmly retained since compounds with > 80 scaffolds were prepared using a small number of optimised procedures.\n\nExcitingly, the compounds prepared had many of the broad structural features that are reminiscent of, and have evolved to constrain, natural products: isolated, fused, and spirocyclic ring systems, intramolecular hydrogen bonding motifs, unsaturation, and dense substitution. In this sense, many of the compounds prepared are natural product-like. As with polyketide biosynthesis, [19] a wholly remarkable number of scaffolds with these broad structural features was accessible using, in combination, a relatively small repertoire of fundamental reaction types.",

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

In this Perspective, we discuss a design approach for the preparation of biologically relevant small-molecule libraries, harnessing the unprecedented combination of NP-derived fragments as an overarching strategy for the synthesis of new bioactive compounds. These novel 'pseudo-natural product' classes retain the biological relevance of NPs, yet exhibit structures and bioactivities not accessible to nature or through the use of existing design strategies. We also analyse selected pseudo-NP libraries using chemoinformatic tools, to assess their molecular shape diversity and properties. To facilitate the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space, we identify design principles and connectivity patterns that would provide access to unprecedented pseudo-NP classes, offering new opportunities for bioactive small-molecule discovery.",

From natural products (NPs) a lot of biology could be learned. Their diverse structures have enriched the collection of known organic molecules. Studies related to their biosynthesis have provided valuable insights into genetics and enzymology. Moreover, many NPs turned out to be useful molecules or lead compounds in the fragrance, crop science or pharmaceutical industries. For the latter this is well documented. Thus, an analysis of the sources of new drugs from 1981-2010 indicated that only 36% of the new chemical entities (NCEs) were discovered without inspiration from a natural product. 1 Despite the obvious importance, interest in natural product isolation by the pharmaceutical industry has declined in recent years. For this, several reasons might be responsible. Certainly, natural product isolation is time consuming and elaborate. A big challenge for the discovery of new NPs is dereplication, that is, to recognize and weed out already known substances. In parallel the last decade has seen a downward trend in the NCEs per year from 2001 to 2010. According to a recent hypothesis this might be due to the heavy reliance of the industry on combinatorial chemistry. 1 Also, it seems that computational techniques like virtual screening are not yet able to produce good lead compounds. Basically, we are far from the vision that a drug candidate can be produced by rational design on a computer or by virtual screening of the chemical space. We still do not know enough about molecular recognition and what it takes for a ligand to trigger a signal on a receptor. Certainly, drug discovery is much more difficult than to make a plaster of a shoe print. It is rather comparable to horse racing or football betting, where knowledge and experience are advantageous.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

However, the chemical structure of natural products covers a wide spectrum from very simple to complex. With more complex structures it is often desirable to simplify the molecule whilst retaining the desired biological activity. This approach seeks to identify the structural unit or pharmacophore responsible for the desired activity. Such pharmacophores have been the start point for a wide range of lead generation and optimisation programmes using techniques such as Biology Oriented Synthesis, Diversity Oriented Synthesis, Diverted Total Synthesis, and Fragment Based Drug Discovery. This review discusses the literature precedence of simplification strategies in four areas of natural product research: proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and compounds isolated from natural product extracts, and their impact on identifying therapeutic products.

The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties.

This occurs by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions. In modern laboratory uses, the process is reproducible and reliable. A chemical synthesis involves one or more compounds (known as reagents or reactants) that will experience a transformation when subjected to certain conditions. Various reaction types can be applied to formulate a desired product. This requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel, such as a chemical reactor or a simple round-bottom flask. Many reactions require some form of processing (\"work-up\") or purification procedure to isolate the final product.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

For each molecule that they describe, the authors present a historical background, photographs of the main protagonists (we also need to know the faces and not only the names of the scientists who spend their lives for the benefit of humanity) and a description of the synthesis of the compound. I was fascinated to learn that salicin (the precursor of aspirin W ) was advocated in ancient Egypt some 3,500 years ago. The ancient Egyptians knew about the beneficial effects of myrtle bark (which contains salicin) on rheumatism and back pain. Similar is the story for the discovery of steroids from Mexican yams. And if you are ready for some mystery and intrigue, read the story of strychnine and how it was used as a poison for murder, along with other alkaloids, such as hemlock, which was used to execute Socrates. The discovery of Taxol W was the result of a major effort in the USA from 1960 to 1981 to identify anticancer ingredients from natural sources (did you know that 110,000 substances from 35,000 plant species were tested?). However, natural compounds are often very difficult to isolate in large quantities from plants. Thus, Taxol's total chemical synthesis (led by the Nicolaou and Holton teams) provided a drug that was much needed. The book appropriately ends with chapters on small molecules and biologics (antiviral agents and vaccines) and their importance in many different genetic diseases. This is the style for all the molecules in the book. You do not need to be a chemist to enjoy and follow the book. I highly recommend this elegant and unique book for every scientist and even for nonscientists with a desire to learn the effects of scientific endeavors in human history. It is a major achievement for the field and rightly so foreworded by two Nobel Prize winners, E.J. Corey and Ryoji Noyori.\n \u00a9 2012 Tsonis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

A rational engineering methodology that is based on molecular principles is in contrast to the widespread trial-and-error approaches common throughout engineering disciplines.

This often gives rise to fundamentally new materials and systems, which are required to address outstanding needs in numerous fields, from energy to healthcare to electronics.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Each of the million or so crystal structures in the database was solved for its own particular reason, but collected together, the structures can be reused to address a multitude of new problems. In this Review, which is focused mainly on the last 10 years, we chronicle the contribution of the CSD to research into molecular geometries, molecular interactions, and molecular assemblies and demonstrate its value in the design of biologically active molecules and the solid forms in which they are delivered. Its potential in other commercially relevant areas is described, including gas storage and delivery, thin films, and (opto)electronics. The CSD also aids the solution of new crystal structures. Because no scientific instrument is without shortcomings, the limitations of CSD research are assessed. We emphasize the importance of maintaining database quality: notwithstanding the arrival of big data and machine learning, it remains perilous to ignore the principle of garbage in, garbage out. Finally, we explain why the CSD must evolve with the world around it to ensure it remains fit for purpose in the years ahead.",

That is how practical it is to make ML-generated molecules from a given set of commercially available reactants (also called starting molecules). For this purpose, Bradshaw et al [2] proposed to apply a generative model on bags of reactants instead of molecules as in previous approaches. In particular, first, an encoder is to map a set of starting molecules to a continuous vector in the latent space. Second, a decoder is to map the continuous vector back to the set of reactants. As the ultimate goal is to generate molecules, in the generation process, the set of predicted reactants is mapped to a final product molecule through a reaction predictor, named Molecule Transformer [20]. Thus, this model not only generates a molecule with optimized chemical properties, but also suggest a set of known starting molecules that can be used to synthesize it. However, a drawback of this model is the limited diversity of generated molecules as it considered only the products as a result of single-step chemical reactions applied on starting molecules, while most natural product molecules are often resulted from multi-step chemical reactions. Concurrent to our work, Bradshaw et al [3] proposed to generate molecules via multi-step synthesis and formalizing a multi-step reaction synthesis as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, their method was based on an additional reaction predictor, which might generate imaginary product molecules. Our method, on the other hand, focuses on chemical reaction trees, for which we generate reaction templates and molecules alternatively.\n\n\nProposed method",

Therefore, there is a need for novel methods for the design of peptide molecules with a particular specific physiochemical profile. The properties of the peptides are governed by the nature of amino acids constituting the peptide. There is a lack of a web server or tools which could predict all the possible combinations of the peptides generated because of the combinations of amino acids based on the physiochemical properties. We have developed a peptide combination generator (PepCoGen), a web server for generating all the possible combinations of peptides by varying the amino acids having similar physiochemical properties at a particular position. It also predicts other properties of the peptides including molecular weight, charge, solubility, hydrophobic plot, and isoelectric point, and random three-dimensional models for each generated combination.\n\n\u25a0 INTRODUCTION",

For machines to discover novel molecules, they must first be trained to sort through the many characteristics of molecules and determine which properties should be retained, suppressed, or enhanced to optimize functions of interest. Machines need to be able to understand, read, write, and eventually create new molecules. Today, this creative process relies on deep generative models, which have gained popularity since powerful deep neural networks were introduced to generative model frameworks. In recent years, they have demonstrated excellent ability to model complex distribution of real-word data (<ie.g.</i, images, audio, text, molecules, and biological sequences). Deep generative models can generate data beyond those provided in training samples, thus yielding an efficient and rapid tool for exploring the massive search space of high-dimensional data such as DNA/protein sequences and facilitating the design of biomolecules with desired functions. Here, we review the emerging field of deep generative models applied to peptide science. In particular, we discuss several popular deep generative model frameworks as well as their applications to generate peptides with various kinds of properties (<ie.g.</i, antimicrobial, anticancer, cell penetration, <ietc</i). We conclude our review with a discussion of current limitations and future perspectives in this emerging field.",

To highlight the improvements of our proposed method, in this section, we focus on the methodologies which adopted generative models to generate small molecules. The common scheme has two parts: 1) encoding: learning to represent molecules by continuous representations which facilitates the prediction and optimization of the chemical properties of interest; 2) decoding: learning to map an optimized continuous representation back to the input molecular graph.\n\nLearning representations based on auto-encoding models Many recent studies highlight the applications of generative models for molecule generation tasks, for instance [9,14,7,11], just to name a few. One typically chooses to use a VAE [13] for this task, where we wish to learn an encoder for mapping a data point x to a latent code z in the continuous latent space, and a decoder for mapping from z back to x. In VAE, the decoder is defined by a likelihood function p G (x|z) and parameterized by a neural network G. A prior distribution, typically normal distribution N (0, I), is imposed on the latent code z and play the role of a regularizer. The posterior distribution is approximated by a variational distribution q E (z|x), which is defined as the encoder and parameterized by another neural network E. The VAE simultaneously learns both the parameters of encoder E and decoder G by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) [13].",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity.

While the tenets of the field were originally implicitly founded on the use of chemistry to create those parts, its modern incarnation has focused on the use of parts assembled from natural components or components intended to mimic their natural counterparts. This would seem justified by the eons of evolution that optimized the natural components for functioning in a cell, at least for a similar function. However, most natural components are recognized by or interact with multiple other components in every cell, possibly in unknown ways, and thus their introduction may have unintended consequences. While truly synthetic parts made by chemists do not benefit from eons of evolution, they are foreign to cells, possibly even drawing upon forces not used by their natural counterparts, and thus they may be more orthogonal and possibly easier to introduce and optimize without perturbation. In this case, optimization must proceed with less information, because less is known about how the parts might interact with their biological targets, and the methodology and lessons of medicinal chemistry, which conceptually face essentially the same challenges, provide the blueprint for success. If the combination of synthetic and medicinal-like chemistry can produce molecules that function alongside those evolved by nature for the most central of its processes, to store and retrieve information, then this approach is likely to be capable of discovering molecules that effectively participate in any biological process, potentially opening a new vista for chemists in synthetic biology.   \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank former and current members of the Romesberg group, as well as those of our collaborators in the Dwyer and Marx groups for their contributions to the research highlighted in this Account.\n\n\u25a0 REFERENCES\n\nFigure 1 .\n1dNaM-dTPT3, dZ-dP, and dDs-dPx (R = H or \u2212CH(OH)\u2212CH 2 OH) UBPs.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2(A) First generation methylated benzene and naphthalene analogs.

The number of possible interfering molecules, however, is so vast that, due to limitations in existing matter and time required for synthesis, they cannot be covered comprehensively. Because proteins and their cognate natural product ligands and substrates co-evolved, these naturally occurring ligands can serve as structural starting points to explore the biologically relevant chemical space. To this end, known natural products are structurally classified on the basis of their core scaffolds and hierarchically arranged in the \"natural product tree\", which can be annotated for bioactivity and intuitively navigated with currently available software. Biologically relevant scaffolds inspire the synthesis of compound libraries enriched in biological activity. This Perspective describes the development of \"biology-oriented synthesis\" as a guiding principle to harness the power of evolution in the quest for novel bioactive small molecules for chemical biology research and drug discovery.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Although many organic molecules can occur in \"right-handed\" and \"left-handed\" forms, invariably just one of these is seen in living organisms.

Antioxidants' applications were industrial, for vulcanization of rubber, corrosion inhibition, and polymerization [1]. Biologically, antioxidants were employed in the inhibition of rancidity of unsaturated fats [2]. In the early 20 th century, Moses Gombery, a chemistry professor discovered the first organic free radicals, triphenylmethyl and vitamin E and C were consequently identified as antioxidants. This discovery portrays antioxidants in good light and brought revolution to the field of biochemistry of living organisms [3,1] The mechanism of action of antioxidants was explored and they were identified as reducing agents [4][5]. Antioxidants are defined as compounds that inhibit freeradical generating chemical reactions. They bind to free radicals so as to prevent them from damaging biological molecules [6] Research on the discovery of natural and synthetic antioxidants drugs design extensively carried out, but there is a lack of single papers with a collection of antioxidant drug design methodologies, design leads, and antioxidants' role in disease therapy. This review presents a collection of research briefs on the design of antioxidant drugs and transformational approaches that enable the modification of antioxidant leads to improved potency and therapeutic applications.\n\n\nANTIOXIDANT FUNCTIONS\n\nBiochemically and physiologically, biological systems develop a balanced redox state as a defense mechanism in an aerobic environment [7]. This typically involve the micro-vascular, enzymatic or nonenzymatic systems of the organism. These systems work in synergy to protect the cells, tissue and organs from free radicals' destructive effects. Ideally, antioxidants eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), chelate redox metals, work effectively in the aqueous and membrane domain and positively affect organism's gene expression. Antioxidants neutralize and eliminate ROS by decreasing the oxygen level, transforming radicals to nonradicals or inhibit the initiation stage of hydroxyl radical ( . OH) formation. Antioxidants exhibit three major defence systems. The first involves antioxidant enzymes. The second involves elemental ions binding proteins such as transferrin and albumin. These binding proteins suppress the formation of free radicals and hinder their adverse reaction with biochemical molecules. The third defense system involves the scavenging of free radicals even in low quantities.",

The hexahydropyridoindole scaffold represents a valuable lead with a great deal of knowledge on molecular mechanisms of free radical scavenging, on bioavailability and toxicity. Its modification may yield congeners tailored according to specific requirements for antiradical efficacy, lipophilicity, and basicity, meeting the aim of providing a pharmacologically practicable antioxidant drug as exemplified by the novel derivative SMe1EC2.

Synthesis and biological evaluation.\nReactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, and oxidative damage are increasingly assigned important roles as harmful factors in pathological conditions and ageing. ROS are potentially reactive molecules derived from the reduction of molecular oxygen in the course of aerobic metabolism. ROS can also be produced through a variety of enzymes. Under normal circumstances, ROS concentrations are tightly controlled by physiological antioxidants. When excessively produced, or when antioxidants are depleted, ROS can impose oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, sugars and DNA. This reduction-oxidation imbalance, called oxidative stress, can subsequently contribute to the development and progression of tissue damage and play a role in the pathology of various diseases. An antioxidant is defined as \"any substance that, when present at low concentrations compared with those of a substrate, significantly delays, prevents or removes oxidative damage to this target molecule\". Despite evidence that oxidative damage contributes to a wide range of clinically important conditions, few antioxidants act as effective drugs in vivo. Inter alia, the difficulty of measuring antioxidant efficacy in vivo makes the interpretation of results from clinical trials difficult. A large number of synthetic compounds have been reported to possess antioxidant activity. Several of them derive from natural antioxidants, others have various structures. In this review, some of the most often reported classes of heterocyclic antioxidant compounds, as well as methods for evaluation of their antioxidant activity are discussed. ",

The bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) for the most active (weakest) OH bond in each molecule was calculated by theoretical methods, as well as the BDE for the semiquinone radical. Reaction rates with the nitrogen-centered free radical DPPH(*) were measured in ethyl acetate. The log of k(DPPH) for bimolecular reaction correlated well with the primary BDE. The correlation between rate constants and calculated BDEs shows that the BDE is a good predictor of antioxidant activity with DPPH(*), suggesting that our design criteria are useful and that these compounds should undergo further testing in cell cultures and in animal models.",

To obtain multipotent antioxidants, one can screen drug collections and/or natural-product libraries, or couple an antioxidant group with other pharmacophores. It is interesting to note that most rationally designed multifunctional antioxidants are structurally different from their naturally occurring counterparts.

The various types of phenolic compounds represent the most important natural antioxidants in addition to some vitamins. The chemical structures of these compounds is discussed in details with their action mechanisms to remove free radicals and prevent many incurable and malignant diseases. In addition to these natural compounds, the last two decades have witnessed increased attempts by many scientific groups and research centers to synthesize chemical compounds in large quantities to mimic these natural compounds, but at a lower cost and greater biological effectiveness. Herein, we conduct a chemical survey of relevant synthetic compounds containing the hydroxyl groups prepared in chemical laboratories and studied for their biological efficacies, such as their effectiveness as antioxidants, as well as the mechanism of elimination of free radicals.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nFree radicals\n\nFree radicals are chemical species such as atoms or group of atoms with an odd (unpaired) number of electrons. They are produced due to splitting weak bonds. The biological free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are usually produced in our bodies. It is known that free radicals are very reactive and may quickly react with other chemical entities (atoms or molecules) by capturing the required electron to gain stability. There are two types of biologically important reactive species. The first type contains oxygen and is known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the second type contains nitrogen and is known as reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Both ROS and RNS can be classified into radicals and non-radical species.\n\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS)",

The formation of free radicals is attributable to different physiochemical factors, radiation exposure, pathological conditions, environmental contaminants, and as by-products of metabolized drugs. The concentration of free radicals is regulated strongly under normal conditions by physiological antioxidants. Free radicals may cause oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, sugars, and DNA when abundantly produced or when antioxidants are depleted. This imbalance of reduction-oxidation, referred to as oxidative stress, can change the body's physiological conditions and ultimately lead to tissue injury, further contributing to various disease pathologies. A proper balance between free radicals and antioxidants is required for an effective physiological process. The oxidation mechanism is chemically hindered by antioxidants; these are often called free radical scavengers. The application of an external antioxidant source is crucial in addressing the issue of oxidative stress. Plenty of naturally occurring, semi-synthetic, and synthetic antioxidants are used, and the search for an efficient, non-toxic, and safe antioxidant is stepped up over time. As an influential scaffold, thiophene and its derivatives have become a significant source of interest for researchers due to its substantial variety of biological activities. The versatility of thiophene moiety has been identified by an affluent unveiling of its derivatives with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer, and antimicrobial behaviors. Thiophene activity has been influenced greatly by the nature and orientation of the substitutions.

On the off chance that free radical overpowers the body's capacity, it generates a condition known as oxidative stress, which can alter physiological conditions of the body and results in several diseases. For appropriate physiological function, it is necessary to have a proper balance between free radicals and antioxidants. Antioxidants chemically inhibit the oxidation process; they are also known as free radical scavengers. For tackling the problem of oxidative stress application of an external source of antioxidant is helpful.

The large values of S E for melatonin in SA and M arises from its ease of synthesis and low mutagenicity. Thus, they are desirable deviations from the references. For dM38, the largest deviations correspond to the physicochemical properties. However, as explained above, it is expected to have a drug-like behavior. Its overall elimination score (S E,ADMETSA ) was found to be lower than that of melatonin. Thus, in general, the investigated derivative has properties that are in line with the reference set of molecules already in use as neuroprotectors.  The eH-DAMA for dM38 is shown in Figure 4, while the reactivity indexes of each species (IE, EA and BDE) are reported in Supplementary Table S3. This map shows that melatonin would not be a good peroxyl radical scavenger, which is in line with previous reports [154]. On the contrary, its derivative dM38 is predicted to be excellent for such a purpose. In its mono-anionic form, which is the dominant one at physiological pH, it is expected to be more efficient than all the explored antioxidant references (i.e., Trolox, ascorbic acid and \u03b1-tocopherol) through both SET and f -HAT. The pKa values of dM38 were estimated to be 5.90 and 12.12 [153]. They correspond to the deprotonation route shown in Scheme 3. The molar fraction estimated using these pKa values are 0.031 and 0.969 for the neutral and mono-anionic species (at pH = 7.4), respectively. The di-anion fraction is negligible (lower than 10 \u22124 ). Accordingly, the analyses in Section 2.2.3.4 will be focused on the mono-anion in an aqueous environment, unless otherwise specified, since it represents the majority of the global dM38 population (96.9%) in such a media. It is important to note, however, that the neutral fraction is not negligible (3.1%) in this case, which guarantees passive crossing through biological membranes. On the contrary, in lipid media, where deprotonation is not viable, the neutral species prevails. The \u2022 OOH scavenging activity of dM38 showed that the main",

Numerous efforts were made to design and synthesize biologically active antioxidants and free oxygen radical scavenging substances that could improve the endogenous antioxidant status. The antioxidant and reactive-oxygen-species-scavenging activity of STB was well demonstrated in many in vitro and in vivo studies. These properties of STB seem to be closely related to its beneficial effects in models of oxidative-stress-involving pathologies, including myocardial infarction, stroke, neurodegenerative disorders, hypoxic-ischemic tissue injury, diabetic complications, chronic inflammation, etc. STB has a good affinity to lipids and exerts its protective activity against free-radical-mediated damage by preventing lipid peroxidation. Rather than interacting with the radicals initiating lipid peroxidation, STB was shown to act in its propagation stage via scavenging peroxyl and/or alkoxyl radicals. STB was also found to protect proteins, predominantly by a mechanism involving protection of thiol groups and by preventing oxidation of amino acids. The first findings on antioxidant and pharmacodynamic effects of STB, tested in a variety of biological models, were summarized in 1998. Recently, chemical modification of STB, which we considered as the leading structure, led to the synthesis of pyridoindole derivatives with significantly increased intrinsic antiradical activity and overall antioxidant efficacy compared to the parental molecule. The present paper provides a complete overview of the literature published since 1998 on both STB and STB congeners. Moreover, appropriate structural modifications of STB provided the opportunity to modulate lipophilicity and acidobasic behavior, thus optimizing bioavailability of the novel derivatives and attenuating their unwanted sideeffects, with the result of decreased toxicity. Hence, STB congeners might be prospectively used as medicinal antioxidants, i.e. remedies effective in conditions involving oxidative stress-mediated injury.",

Herein, in light of recent findings as well as kinetics on free radical reaction, the discipline of free radical chemistry is introduced to be a novel tool for finding potential drugs from antioxidant libraries accumulated during the study on free radical chemistry. These antioxidants provide with such abundant types of structural skeleton that might be employed to inhibit oxidations in different biological microenvironments. Although the in\u00a0vitro characterization on the antioxidative property exerts a potential role of an antioxidant as a prodrug, the in\u00a0vivo investigation on the property for quenching free radicals will make a final decision for the antioxidant whether it is worthy to be further explored pharmacologically.

Antioxidant drug design refers to the process of developing antioxidant medications based on the knowledge of the structures and functions of a biomolecular target [53]. The methodological approach in rational drug design (reverse pharmacology) eliminates the trial-and-error testing of hundreds of drug molecules on cultured cells or animals observed in the traditional method (forward pharmacology). It is based on the hypothesis that modulation of a specific druggable and disease-modifying biological target may have some therapeutic effects [54]; the shape and charge of a drug molecule must be complementary to the biological target with which they interact in order to be able to bind to it [55]. The antioxidant drug design involves the identification of a receptor that is relevant to an oxidative stress-mediated disease for which a drug is being designed, elucidation of the structure and function of the receptor or enzyme and the designing of the antioxidant drug molecule that exhibits some therapeutic benefits when it interacts with the receptor or enzyme [54]. The significant types of drug design are currently ligand-based and structure-based relying on the knowledge of the binding molecule and the three dimensional structure of the biological target [56]. The ligandbased design also known as indirect drug design is dependent on the knowledge of other molecules that bind to specific biological targets [57]. The structure-based design referred to as direct drug design is based on three current methods, namely; virtual screening, de novo design of ligands and optimization of known ligands [58]. However, computer-aided drug design that enables the prediction of binding affinity before a compound is synthesized is usually utilized at various stages of drug design such as hit identification by virtual screening, hit and lead optimization of affinity/selectivity and lead optimization of other relevant pharmacological properties [59][60]. Moreover, other properties such as metabolic half-life, bioavailability and toxicity must be ascertained before a ligand is considered an efficacious and safe antioxidant drug [61].",

Owing to the fact that quercetin is a typical multipotent antioxidant possessing the significant radical-scavenging ability and inhibitory activity against extra 10 separate enzymes, it is therefore recommended as a prototype for detailed assessment and elucidation of some elements of natural antioxidant. In addition to the radical-scavenging ability revealed by QSARs as discussed above, quercetin analogues are also enzyme inhibitors [136]. The diverse pharmacological properties of quercetin is due to the functional group substitutions of flavonol molecule [137]. Recently, Simanjuntak et al.

The dM38 melatonin derivative is used as a study case to illustrate the protocol in detail. This was found to be a highly promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegeneration, in particular Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This also has the desired properties of an oral-drug, which is significantly better than Trolox for scavenging free radicals, and has chelates redox metals, prevents the <sup\u25cf</supOH production, via Fenton-like reactions, repairs oxidative damage in biomolecules (lipids, proteins, and DNA), and acts as a polygenic neuroprotector by inhibiting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB). To the best of our best knowledge, CADMA-Chem is currently the only protocol that simultaneously involves the analyses of drug-like behavior, toxicity, manufacturability, versatile antioxidant protection, and receptor-ligand binding affinities.

This involves using the equation: pKa = m \u2206G BA + C 0 , where \u2206G BA is the Gibbs energy difference between the conjugated base and the acid. The parameters (m and C 0 , i.e., the slope and intercept of the linear fit) are currently available, at numerous levels of theory, for phenols, amines, carboxylic acids, and thiols.

Molecules with a negligible neutral fraction (lower than 1%) are not considered further. The reason is that multifunctional antioxidants, with oral drug like behavior, are expected to enter the cells by passively crossing biological membranes.\n\n\nFree Radical Scavenging (AOX-I)\n\nThe investigation of AOX-I (for subset 2) includes thermochemistry, kinetics, and all possible reaction mechanisms and pathways. It is recommended to use Gibbs free energies for thermochemical analyses; thus, entropy is considered. For kinetics, there are some important aspects to keep in mind: (i) To include all the reaction sites when calculating the overall rate coefficients; (ii) to consider environmental conditions such as its polarity and pH; (iii) to include tunneling corrections for f -HAT reactions; (iv) to consider the reaction path degeneracy; (v) to consider the diffusion rate; and (vi) to use not very reactive radicals, such as the antioxidants counterpart, peroxyl radicals, are ideal for this role. These aspects are in line with the QM-ORSA protocol, which has been proven to produce rate constants that are in very good agreement with the experiments [104].\n\n\nOIL Behavior (AOX-II)",

QSAR studies of antioxidants showed that excellent radical-scavenging antioxidants must possess three essential features. (i) The X(O,S,N,C)-H bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) or ionization potential (IP) should be suitable. It was observed that low BDE and IP favour direct radical-scavenging activity in polar or non-polar solvents. Polar solvents and very low ionization potential enhance pro-oxidant danger due to direct electron transfer to oxygen [96][97][98]. (ii) The solubility must be appropriate in the applied environments. It was pointed out that hydrophobic antioxidants perform better in an emulsion system while hydrophilic antioxidant exhibit better activity in bulk lipids [99][100].\n\nHydrophobicity is preferred to hydrophilicity due to the heterogeneous nature of biological and chemical systems and some degree of lipophilicity is required for antioxidants to penetrate the bio-membrane. (iii) The toxicity profile of antioxidants and their metabolites in addition to antioxidant derived radicals should be at the barest minimum [101][102]. These prerequisites should be considered for a successful design of novel antioxidants of high activity and low toxicity.\n\n\nDe novo DESIGN OF ANTIOXIDANT DRUGS\n\nThis method of drug design employs two successful strategies. (1) Good features of two or more antioxidants are assembled into a single molecule.\n\n(2) New structures are discovered by computer-aided methodologies [95]. Several illustrations are given below.\n\nThe combination of an antioxidant moiety of \u03b1tocopherol and uric acid yielded hydroxylphenylurea a lead structure that exhibited about ten times higher antioxidant activity than individual \u03b1-tocopherol or uric acid moiety (Fig. 7) [103].",

Whereas existing production routes use well-known, safe, industrial microorganisms, future production schemes may include designer cells that are tailor-made for the desired chemical and production process. In any future, metabolic engineering will soon rival and potentially eclipse synthetic organic chemistry.",

Traditional approaches to drug discovery rely on a stepwise synthesis and screening program for large numbers of compounds to optimize activity profiles.

While the tenets of the field were originally implicitly founded on the use of chemistry to create those parts, its modern incarnation has focused on the use of parts assembled from natural components or components intended to mimic their natural counterparts. This would seem justified by the eons of evolution that optimized the natural components for functioning in a cell, at least for a similar function. However, most natural components are recognized by or interact with multiple other components in every cell, possibly in unknown ways, and thus their introduction may have unintended consequences. While truly synthetic parts made by chemists do not benefit from eons of evolution, they are foreign to cells, possibly even drawing upon forces not used by their natural counterparts, and thus they may be more orthogonal and possibly easier to introduce and optimize without perturbation. In this case, optimization must proceed with less information, because less is known about how the parts might interact with their biological targets, and the methodology and lessons of medicinal chemistry, which conceptually face essentially the same challenges, provide the blueprint for success. If the combination of synthetic and medicinal-like chemistry can produce molecules that function alongside those evolved by nature for the most central of its processes, to store and retrieve information, then this approach is likely to be capable of discovering molecules that effectively participate in any biological process, potentially opening a new vista for chemists in synthetic biology.   \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank former and current members of the Romesberg group, as well as those of our collaborators in the Dwyer and Marx groups for their contributions to the research highlighted in this Account.\n\n\u25a0 REFERENCES\n\nFigure 1 .\n1dNaM-dTPT3, dZ-dP, and dDs-dPx (R = H or \u2212CH(OH)\u2212CH 2 OH) UBPs.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2(A) First generation methylated benzene and naphthalene analogs.

Virtual molecules assembled from existing starting material connected by these reactions are supposed to have an enhanced chance to be amenable to real chemical synthesis. About 50% of the reactions in the dataset are ring-forming reactions, which fosters the assembly of novel ring systems and innovative chemotypes. A comparison with a recent survey of the reactions used in early drug discovery revealed considerable overlaps with the collection presented here. The dataset is available encoded as computer-readable Reaction SMARTS expressions from the Supporting Information presented for this paper.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Special Issue \"Feature Review Papers in Organic Synthesis\". Molecules 2022, 27, 825.\n\n\nOrganic synthesis allows scientists to construct and modify organic compounds using a continuously growing arsenal of reactions and methodologies. Consequently, new or improved procedures are reported daily for preparing a wide variety of valuable compounds belonging to the most different fields. This Special Issue of Molecules presents contributions reviewing modern synthetic procedures employed in several research areas.\n\nThe preparation of products suitable as starting materials for the synthesis of compounds of interest is always a critical point in organic synthesis. The contribution of Verochkina et al. illustrates this point [1], reviewing the synthesis of structurally \u03b1-functionalized \u03b1,\u03b2unsaturated aldehydes, an important class of compounds widely used in fine organic synthesis, biology, pharmacology, chemical industry, and agriculture.\n\nThe generation of heterocyclic systems is also an important topic in organic synthesis, as they appear in many biologically active compounds. Zhilitskaya et al. [2] present a representative review on this topic, which shows recent synthetic trends in the chemistry of biologically active 2-amino and 2-mercapto substituted benzothiazoles, from conventional multistep processes to one-pot, atom-economy procedures performed using green chemistry principles. In addition, the review of Zhang et al. [3] is another interesting example of heterocyclic chemistry, showing contributions in the design of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) analogues. AHLs are small signalling molecules used by many Gram-negative bacteria, analogues and mimics of AHLs being biologically relevant targets.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Organic chemistry, and its unique ability to tailor natural products through synthesis, provides an extraordinary approach to unlock the full potential of natural products. In this Review, an approach based on natural product derived fragments is presented that can successfully address some of the current challenges in drug discovery. These fragments often display significantly reduced molecular weights, reduced structural complexity, a reduced number of synthetic steps, while retaining or even improving key biological parameters such as potency or selectivity. Examples from various stages of the drug development process up to the clinic are presented. In addition, this process can be leveraged by recent developments such as genome mining, antibody-drug conjugates, and computational approaches. All these concepts have the potential to identify the next generation of drug candidates inspired by natural products. ",

Protecting group patterns must be designed to achieve the desired connectivity and stereoselectivity in high yield. In addition, the nature of the protecting group can directly influence the reactivity of the building block, affecting reaction times and yield.\n\nThe basic features of a building block are highlighted in Figure 7 and include the anomeric leaving group (LG), a participating group (for 1,2-trans linkages) or nonparticipating group (for 1,2-cis linkages) at the C2 position (R 1 ), temporary protecting groups that are stable under glycosylation conditions but readily removed for the next glycosylation reaction (R 2 ) and permanent protecting groups that remain intact until the final global deprotection step (R 3 ).\n\nMammalian carbohydrates are commonly comprised of ten monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, mannose, sialic acid, N-acetlyglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, and xylose ( Figure 8). In principle, each carbohydrate residue can be linked through any of its different functional groups and each linkage generates a new stereocenter. The potential diversity is significant. For example, the number of theoretical structures possible for a hexasaccharide comprised from any one of the ten mammalian monosaccharides is approximately 190 billion! It has been estimated that 224 building blocks would be required to assemble any given mammalian oligosaccharide. 9 However, recent studies have suggested that only 36 building blocks would be required to access approximately 75% of all known mammalian oligosaccharides due to significant overlaps in common connectivities. 10 Thirty of these building blocks are shown in Figure 9 and are ranked by relative abundance in mammalian oligosaccharides.",

The general process is illustrated in Figure 3. Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed. The oligosaccharide can then be functionalized for further study.",

Complex carbohydrates, according to the different number of monosaccharide units, can be classed into three groups, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. A disaccharide is formed from two monosaccharides. Oligosaccharides can be formed by a small number of monosaccharides linked together. Higher oligosaccharides are called polysaccharides.

All areas of synthetic methodology have seen major advances and many complex, highly branched carbohydrates and glycoproteins have been prepared using solution- and/or solid-phase approaches. The development of an automated oligosaccharide synthesizer provides rapid access to biologically relevant compounds. These chemical approaches help to produce sufficient quantities of defined oligosaccharides for biological studies. Synthetic chemistry also supports an improved understanding of glycobiology and will eventually result in the discovery of new therapeutics.",

The programmable one-pot oligosaccharide synthesis approach is designed to empower fast oligosaccharide synthesis of large amounts using thioglycoside building blocks (BBLs) with the appropriate sequential order of relative reactivity values (RRVs). Auto-CHO is a cross-platform software with a graphical user interface that provides possible synthetic solutions for programmable one-pot oligosaccharide synthesis by searching a BBL library (containing about 150 validated and &gt;50,000 virtual BBLs) with accurately predicted RRVs by support vector regression. The algorithm for hierarchical one-pot synthesis has been implemented in Auto-CHO and uses fragments generated by one-pot reactions as new BBLs. In addition, Auto-CHO allows users to give feedback for virtual BBLs to keep valuable ones for further use. One-pot synthesis of stage-specific embryonic antigen 4 (SSEA-4), which is a pluripotent human embryonic stem cell marker, is demonstrated in this work.",

With regard to the latter point, natural products offer an outstanding source of biologically active molecules that provide many useful features that enable us to design innovative, biologically biased, synthetic compounds. This article outlines the recent approaches in this area and suggests a simple metric to assess synthetic compounds for natural product likeness.",

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to",

In its most common form, it involves modification of a known active scaffold or linking known active scaffolds, although de novo drug design (i.e., from scratch) is also possible. Though highly interrelated, identification of active scaffolds should be conceptually separated from drug design. Traditionally, the drug design process has focused on the molecular determinants of the interactions between the drug and its known or intended molecular target. Nevertheless, current drug design also takes into consideration other relevant processes than influence drug efficacy and safety (e.g., bioavailability, metabolic stability, interaction with antitargets).This chapter provides an overview on possible approaches to identify active scaffolds (including in silico approximations to approach that task) and computational methods to guide the subsequent optimization process. It also discusses in which situations each of the overviewed techniques is more appropriate.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

Proven strategies include diverted total synthesis (DTS), function-oriented synthesis (FOS), biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), complexity to diversity (CtD), hybrid molecules, and biosynthesis inspired synthesis. The latter includes mutasynthesis, the synthesis of natural products encoded by silent genes, and propionate scanning. Most of the examples from our group fall in the quite general concept of DTS. Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis. However, even for compounds of moderate complexity, organic synthesis remains a bottle neck. Unless some method for predicting the biological activity of a designed molecule becomes available, the design and synthesis of natural product analogues will remain what it is now, namely it will largely rely on trial and error.

In this Perspective, we explore how connecting Nature's small molecules to the genes that encode them has sparked a renaissance in natural product research, focusing primarily on the biosynthesis of polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. We survey monomer biogenesis, coupling chemistries from templated and non-templated pathways, and the broad set of tailoring reactions and hybrid pathways that give rise to the diverse scaffolds and functionalization patterns of natural products. We conclude by considering two questions: What would it take to find all natural product scaffolds? What kind of scientists will be studying natural products in the future?",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

Many of these new functions will require binding to small molecules. Is the ability to bind small molecules a property that arises only in response to biological selection or computational design? Or alternatively, is small molecule binding a property of folded proteins that occurs readily amidst collections of unevolved sequences? These questions can be addressed by assessing the binding potential of de novo proteins that are designed to fold into stable structures, but are \"na\u00efve\" in the sense that they (i) share no significant sequence similarity with natural proteins and (ii) were neither selected nor designed to bind small molecules. We chose three na\u00efve proteins from a library of sequences designed to fold into 4-helix bundles and screened for binding to 10,000 compounds displayed on small molecule microarrays. Several binders were identified, and binding was characterized by a series of biophysical assays. Surprisingly, despite the similarity of the three de novo proteins to one another, they exhibit selective ligand binding. These findings demonstrate the potential of novel proteins for molecular recognition and have significant implications for a range of applications in synthetic biology.",

DOS pathways and new techniques for small-molecule screening provided many new, potentially disruptive insights into biology. Small-molecule probes of histone and tubulin deacetylases, transcription factors, cytoplasmic anchoring proteins, developmental signaling proteins (e.g., histacin, tubacin, haptamide, uretupamine, concentramide, and calmodulophilin), among many others, have been uncovered in the Schreiber lab using diversity-oriented synthesis and chemical",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

That is how practical it is to make ML-generated molecules from a given set of commercially available reactants (also called starting molecules). For this purpose, Bradshaw et al [2] proposed to apply a generative model on bags of reactants instead of molecules as in previous approaches. In particular, first, an encoder is to map a set of starting molecules to a continuous vector in the latent space. Second, a decoder is to map the continuous vector back to the set of reactants. As the ultimate goal is to generate molecules, in the generation process, the set of predicted reactants is mapped to a final product molecule through a reaction predictor, named Molecule Transformer [20]. Thus, this model not only generates a molecule with optimized chemical properties, but also suggest a set of known starting molecules that can be used to synthesize it. However, a drawback of this model is the limited diversity of generated molecules as it considered only the products as a result of single-step chemical reactions applied on starting molecules, while most natural product molecules are often resulted from multi-step chemical reactions. Concurrent to our work, Bradshaw et al [3] proposed to generate molecules via multi-step synthesis and formalizing a multi-step reaction synthesis as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). However, their method was based on an additional reaction predictor, which might generate imaginary product molecules. Our method, on the other hand, focuses on chemical reaction trees, for which we generate reaction templates and molecules alternatively.\n\n\nProposed method",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

We empirically observed that a half of molecules generated by JT-VAE cannot be synthesized by Retro*. MOLECULE CHEF also had a similar synthetisizability rate (65.6%) as it was restricted to molecules which are products of singe-step chemical reactions. DoG-Gen had a slightly better rate (67%). Our method achieved the highest rate by directly learning to generate full synthetic routes with specific reaction templates and molecules.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this work, we have proposed a generative model for generating multi-step chemical reactions by exploiting the junction tree notion. The proposed model tackles two problems of molecule generation: 1) generation of valid molecules with desired chemical properties and 2) synthesizability of the generated molecules. Experiments showed that the model could generate chemical reactions whose product molecules are with high chemical properties. More importantly, each generated molecule is associated with a complete synthetic route, making it practical to synthesize in reality. one of the main limitations of our method is the need of synthetic routes of training molecules associated with huge numbers of starting molecules and reaction templates, which are not always available or limited in practice. Our future work would be a focus on the development of machine learning models which can be used with both reaction trees and also molecules with unknown synthetic routes.\n\n\nBroader Impact\n\nBringing a new drug to market is money-and time-consuming process with the average cost of over one billion USD and time of 13 years from discovery to market. Machine learning (or more broadly Artificial Intelligence (AI)) is having an increasing impact on accelerating many parts of the drug discovery pipeline. The current approaches to drug molecular generation leads to most molecules being unstable or impossible to synthesize in reality. We hope that our proposed model with the ability to produce synthesizable molecules, contributes to the research in this direction.",

New findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptors exist on gut afferent neurones and that their activation by locally released 5-HT leads to visceral nociceptive stimulation, in addition to increased neuronally-mediated motor and secretory activity. If this concept is validated, it will provide a rationale for the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in patients with increased gut motility, reduced fluid absorption and low nociceptive thresholds leading to abdominal pain. Alosetron is a highly selective, potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which is well absorbed with a long pharmacodynamic half-life. Its ability to provide long-lasting blockade of 5-HT3 receptors throughout the body make it an ideal candidate within its class to evaluate the clinical hypothesis that sustained and ubiquitous 5-HT3 receptor blockade is of value in the treatment of IBS.",

Pharmacokinetics of oral tegaserod are linear in the 2--12 mg dose range. After oral administration tegaserod is metabolized mainly pre-systemically; when absorbed, intact tegaserod is excreted as N-glucuronides mainly via the bile. No clinically relevant drug--drug interactions were identified. Tegaserod has proven safe in toxicity studies. In pharmacodynamic studies, tegaserod stimulated the peristaltic reflex in vitro, increased canine intestinal and colonic motility and transit, reduced visceral afferent firing or sensation in response to distension in animals, and accelerated gastric, small bowel and colonic transit in healthy patients, and small bowel transit in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Three large phase III randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trials were performed predominantly in females (approximately 85%) with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. Overall, phase III results support efficacy as assessed by the subject's global assessment of relief with significant improvement in secondary endpoints such as abdominal pain, bowel frequency and consistency.

Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is a serotonin receptor type 3 antagonist approved in early 2000 for use in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Initial use was widespread, but infrequent serious adverse events of ischemic colitis and severe constipation-related complications prompted alosetron's voluntary withdrawal from the US market in November 2000. Unprecedented public request prompted its reintroduction in 2002 under a Risk Management Plan, including a more restricted indication and a Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Despite these measures, the use of alosetron has been very limited since its reintroduction. Possible deterrents to its use include concerns over safety and the possible medical-legal implications raised by the Risk Management Plan. It is also possible that changes in the natural history and/or diagnosis of IBS-D have reduced the target population.

This article profiles these concerns and reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety, and post-marketing experience with alosetron.

Two reviewers independently searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science (January 1, 1966 to December 15, 2006) for randomized controlled trials of 5-HT(3) antagonists in IBS reporting clinical end points of the IBS symptom complex and safety parameters. Study characteristics, markers of methodologic quality, and outcomes for the intention-to-treat population for each randomized controlled trial were extracted independently. We found 14 eligible randomized controlled trials of alosetron (n = 3024) or cilansetron (n = 1116) versus placebo (n = 3043) or mebeverine (n = 304). Random-effects meta-analyses found 5-HT(3) antagonists more effective than the comparators in achieving global improvement in IBS symptoms (pooled relative risk, 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-1.72; I(2) = 0%) and relief of abdominal pain and discomfort (pooled relative risk, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.22-1.39; I(2) = 22%).

IBS can be divided into three main types IBS-D (diarrhea predominant), IBS-C (constipation predominant), and mixed or alternating IBS. 5-HT(3) receptor antagonism has proved to be an efficacious treatment option for IBS-D. For example, alosetron displays efficacy in the treatment of multiple symptoms, including abdominal pain, discomfort, urgency, stool frequency and consistency. However, significant constipation occurred in approximately 25% of patients, leading to withdrawal of up to 10% of patients in clinical trials. Targeting compounds with partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(3) receptor represents a mechanistic departure from the classic 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist approach and should result in agents that are applicable to a broader array of IBS patient populations. Attenuation of the activity of the ion channel without completely abolishing its function may control or normalize bowel function without leading to a total block associated with severe constipation. We have identified a new class of selective, orally active 5-HT(3) receptor ligands with high 5-HT(3) receptor affinity and low partial agonist activity currently in preclinical development that should offer a significant advantage over existing therapies.",

Serotonin is an important monoamine neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the initiation of peristaltic and secretory refl exes, and in modulation of visceral sensations. Several serotonin receptor subtypes have been characterized, of which 5HT3, 5HT4, and 5HT1b are the most important for GI function. 5HT4 agonists (eg, tegaserod) potentiate peristalsis initiated by 5HT1 receptor stimulation. 5HT4 agonists are therefore useful in constipation predominant form of IBS and in chronic constipation. 5HT3 antagonists (Alosetron and Cilansetron) prevent the activation of 5HT3 receptors on extrinsic afferent neurons and can decrease the visceral pain associated with IBS. These agents also retard small intestinal and colonic transit, and are therefore useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Tegaserod has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo controlled trials to relieve global IBS symptoms as well as individual symptoms of abdominal discomfort, number of bowel movements and stool consistency. Several randomized, controlled trials have shown that alosetron relieves pain, improves bowel function, and provides global symptom improvement in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, ischemic colitis and severe complications of constipation have been major concerns leading to voluntary withdrawal of Alosetron from the market followed by remarketing with a comprehensive risk management program.",

Increased mucosal permeability, visceral hypersensitivity and activation status of intestinal mucosal immune cells cause changes in gastrointestinal (GI) motility, secretion and sensation observed in the course of IBS. Permanent, cumbersome symptoms, such as diarrhea, constipation and abdominal pain greatly lower the quality of life of IBS patients. On this basis, according to the Rome IV criteria, different forms of IBS can be distinguished. This article focuses on the role of serotonin system in the pathophysiology of IBS as a potential therapeutic target. We shortly describe several molecules, associated with serotonin receptors, mainly 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and 5-HT4 receptor agonists, that are used in the treatment of motility disorders and visceral pain in IBS patients. We summarize the findings obtained in the clinical trials and elaborate on the safety of the serotonin ligands. Although the majority of serotonin receptor ligands relieve global symptoms, there are also some adverse effects, which can be dangerous for patients. We postulate that currently, among all serotonin-targeting compounds, ramosetron is the best treatment option for IBS-D patients, due to its exceptional efficacy in both genders as well as good tolerability. Whereas, tegaserod is highly recommended for IBS-C sufferers. Nevertheless, numerous studies on the new serotonin receptor ligands are conducted to ensure the delivery of novel compounds with improved efficacy and safety profiles.",

Animal models have shown it to be active in anxiety, psychosis, cognitive impairment, emesis and drug withdrawal, though its application in humans has been almost entirely restricted to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Alosetron does not cause adverse pharmacodynamic effects, is absorbed rapidly after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout tissues after oral or iv. dosing in animals. Its metabolism is rapid and extensive with N-demethylation, hydroxylation and oxidation. The drug, or its two principal metabolites, is equally excreted through the biliary tract and kidneys. Alosetron has proved safe in a range of toxicity studies; at high repeated dosing, clinical signs were transient and repeated administration produced no significant adverse effects on fertility, reproductive performance or fetal development. In pharmacokinetic studies, bioavailability of alosetron in healthy volunteers is approximately 60% and the plasma half-life is about 1.5 h. There are some gender differences in the pharmacokinetic profile, with 30 - 50% higher alosetron concentrations in females. No consistent differences in alosetron serum concentrations between the young and elderly were observed. The pharmacokinetics of single, oral doses of alosetron are linear up to 8 mg. In human pharmacodynamic studies, alosetron increased basal jejunal water and electrolyte absorption, increased colonic transit time and, consequently, whole gut transit time. Alosetron has been evaluated in two large Phase II trials (randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled) and in Phase III trials which included a four-week observation period after cessation. Dose response studies suggested that the effective dosages could be between 1 and 2 mg, twice-daily. In Phase II trials, alosetron, 1 mg b.i.d., resulted in a greater proportion of non-constipated IBS patients reporting adequate relief of pain and discomfort, as well as improvement of bowel symptoms, frequency, urgency and stool consistency when compared with placebo. However, this beneficial effect was seen exclusively among females. Phase III studies evaluated exclusively females with non-constipated IBS and confirmed the results of the Phase II studies. Alosetron was well-tolerated in all studies, with the most frequently recorded adverse event being constipation. Thus, alosetron appears promising in the treatment of abdominal pain and discomfort and normalising of bowel function in patients with non-constipated IBS. It also improves quality of life, has a high degree of tolerability and has an excellent safety profile to date.",

The pooled RR showed that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists improved abnormal bowel habits or stool consistency symptoms (RR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.99). The pooled RR of adverse events following 5-HT3 receptor antagonist treatment was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.22). Subgroup analysis indicated that alosetron had a high rate of adverse effects (RR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.25); adverse events following ramosetron treatment were not statistically significantly different. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists were likelier to cause constipation: the pooled RR of constipation developing with 5-HT3 receptor antagonist versus placebo was 3.71 (95% CI: 2.98-4.61). However, constipation was likelier in patients with non-constipated IBS after taking 5-HT3 receptor antagonists than in patients with IBS-D only (non-constipated IBS and IBS-D: RR = 5.28 [95% CI: 3.93, 7.08] vs. IBS-D only 3.24 [2.54, 4.12]).

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) plays important physiological roles in the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle. Intraluminal distension of the intestine is known to stimulate the release of endogenous 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells, activating 5-HT3 receptors located on primary afferent neurons and leading to increases in intestinal secretions and peristaltic activity. Ramosetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, has been in development for use in patients suffering from diarrhea-predominant IBS. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 418 patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS-D, once-daily 5 \u03bcg and 10 \u03bcg doses of ramosetron increased the monthly responder rates of IBS symptoms compared to placebo. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial of 539 patients, a positive response to treatment was reported by 47% of a once-daily 5 \u03bcg dose of ramosetron-treated individuals compared to 27% of patients receiving placebo (P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, the responder rate was increased in the oral administration of 5 \u03bcg of ramosetron for at least 28 weeks (up to 52 weeks), and long-term efficacy for overall improvement of IBS symptoms was also demonstrated. The rate was further increased subsequently. Adverse events were reported by 7% in ramosetron treatment. No serious adverse events, eg, severe constipation or ischemic colitis, were reported for long-term treatment with ramosetron.

A previous meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials of the 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist alosetron found that this agent was associated with global improvement in symptoms, pain, and discomfort in patients with IBS. This was a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of alosetron for the management of IBS. It updated and expanded on the previous meta-analysis. PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the cochrane central Register of controlled Trials were searched from 1966 through September 2007 for placebo-controlled trials that examined the efficacy and tolerability of alosetron in the management of IBS. The search terms were alosetron, 5-HT, irritable bowel, functional bowel diseases, and irritable colon. No language restriction was applied. The data were analyzed in terms of 2 main outcomes: global improvement in IBS symptoms and adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort. Eight multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trials met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The studies included 4,170 patients with IBS (80% female) who were randomized to receive either alosetron or placebo. All patients met the Rome criteria for IBS, and all subtypes of IBS were represented. Most patients had diarrhea-predominant IBS; only 2.6% of patients had constipation-predominant IBS. In the 3 trials included in the analysis of global improvement in symptoms, alosetron was significantly more effective than placebo (relative risk [RR] = 1.60; 95% CI, 1.44-1.76; P &lt;0.001).

Analysis of adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort by sex also indicated significant differences between alosetron and placebo in both sexes (female: RR = 1.34 [95% cI, 1.21-1.48]; male: RR = 1.23 [95% CI, 1.02-1.47]).

In experimental studies, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been reported to slow colon transit, to blunt gastrocolonic reflex, and to reduce rectal sensitivity. Alosetron and cilansetron, potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, have proven efficacy in the treatment of IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). However, alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn due to postmarketing reports of ischemic colitis and complications of constipation, and cilansetron was never marketed. Currently alosetron is available under a risk management program for women with severe IBS-D. Ramosetron is another potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which has been marketed in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In animal studies, ramosetron reduced defecation induced by corticotrophin-releasing hormone and had inhibitory effects on colonic nociception. In two randomized controlled studies including 957 patients with IBS-D, ramosetron increased monthly responder rates of patient-reported global assessment of IBS symptom relief compared with placebo. Ramosetron was also as effective as mebeverine in male patients with IBS-D. In a recent randomized controlled trial with 343 male patients with IBS-D, ramosetron has proved effective in improving stool consistency, relieving abdominal pain/discomfort, and improving health-related quality of life. Regarding safety, ramosetron is associated with a lower incidence of constipation compared with other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and has not been associated with ischemic colitis. Although further large prospective studies are needed to assess whether ramosetron is effective for female patients with IBS-D and to evaluate its long-term safety, ramosetron appears to be one of the most promising agents for patients with IBS-D.

It is a paracrine messenger utilized by enterochromaffin (EC) cells, which function as sensory transducers. Serotonin activates intrinsic and extrinsic primary afferent neurons to, respectively, initiate peristaltic and secretory reflexes and to transmit information to the central nervous system. Serotonin is also a neurotransmitter utilized by a system of long descending myenteric interneurons. Serotonin is synthesized through the actions of 2 different tryptophan hydroxylases, TpH1 and TpH2, which are found, respectively, in EC cells and neurons. Serotonin is inactivated by the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT)-mediated uptake into enterocytes or neurons. The presence of many serotonin receptor subtypes enables selective drugs to be designed to therapeutically modulate gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and sensation. Current examples include tegaserod, a 5-HT(4) partial agonist, which has been approved for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation in women and for chronic constipation in men and women. The 5-HT(3) antagonists, granisetron and ondansetron, are useful in combating the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy, and alosetron is employed in the treatment of IBS with diarrhea. Serotonergic signaling abnormalities have also been putatively implicated in the pathogenesis of functional bowel diseases.

The precise underlying pathophysiology of IBS remains unknown. However, disturbances in the brain-gut axis involving the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system have emerged as an underlying concept for IBS. In this regard, conventional treatment has been recognised as unsatisfactory for many patients with IBS and novel, neuroenteric modulatory compounds have been introduced for use by clinicians. Specifically, compounds interacting with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype have been demonstrated of benefit in some patients for the treatment of IBS. In this leading article, we present the current data on the pharmacology, clinical trials, indications and adverse effects of alosetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3 antagonist.

Traditional agents, although occasionally effective, often cause adverse effects. Tegaserod, a selective serotonin type 4 receptor (5-HT4) partial agonist, overcomes a number of obstacles associated with traditional therapies. Important information for pharmacists about the safety and tolerability of tegaserod is presented. Tegaserod is effective in treating multiple IBS symptoms in women with IBS whose primary bowel symptom is constipation, and it is safe and well tolerated.",

There is much interest in the use of serotonin agents as new therapeutics. Acting primarily through 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, serotonin elicits changes in motor function and possibly visceral sensation. Two serotonin agents were developed specifically for IBS: tegaserod, a 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist, and alosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (which is no longer available). Phase III clinical trial data show that during a 12-week treatment period with tegaserod, IBS patients with abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, and constipation experienced significant global relief (i.e., improvement in overall well-being, abdominal pain, and bowel habit) compared with placebo. Improvement in bowel movement frequency and consistency was achieved and pain was relieved by 1 week. During 12 weeks of treatment, alosetron was shown to elicit significant relief of abdominal pain and discomfort compared with placebo or mebeverine in female IBS patients with diarrhea. Alosetron slowed colonic transit and treatment efficacy was apparent after a week of treatment. Another 5-HT4 receptor agonist, prucalopride, which is being developed for chronic constipation, accelerates colonic transit and increases stool frequency. Therefore, this agent may be of benefit in IBS patients with constipation.",

It has been reported that out of the 877 New Chemical Entities (NCEs) established between 1981 and 2002, ca. 49% arose from natural products, or, synthetic molecules based on natural-product-pharmacophores [6,7]. However, pharmaceutical research into natural secondary metabolites has declined in the last two decades because of the difficulty in isolating compounds with skeletally novel frameworks from natural resources rather than from combinatorial synthetic protocols [7][8][9].\n\nThe term \"meroterpenoid\" was first used by Cornforth [10] in 1986 to describe natural products bearing a mixed terpenoid biogenesis. The prefix \"mero-\" is derived from the Greek word \"merus\" which means \"fragment, or part, or partial\" [11][12][13]. Meroterpenoids are thus a class of natural products derived from hybrid polyketide or non-polyketide and terpenoid biosynthesis. The unusual enzyme reactions responsible for connectivities among their structures, and their unique ring cores create a most interesting chemical diversity among meroterpenoids [11,14,15]. Interestingly, meroterpenoids are mostly reported from fungi and marine organisms while only a limited number of meroterpenoids were obtained from plants [9].",

In particular, betulinic acid (BA), which is a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenic acid (Figure 1), is commonly isolated from birch (Betula spp.) bark, displaying important biological activities [1,2]. Among triterpenic acids, BA gained special attention from the scientific community from the moment that two of its synthetic derivatives, namely bevirimat (Myriad Genetics) and BMS-955176 (GSK) (Figure 1), were known as efficient anti-HIV drugs, reaching phase IIb clinical trials [3,4]. Meanwhile, GSK pursued its study in the development of HIV maturation inhibitors and produced another interesting molecule with a similar structure to BMS-955176 known as GSK'254 ( Figure 1), which is a phase IIb clinical candidate [5].\n\nBA proved to be an attractive scaffold for chemical upgrading [6], including its functionalization with oxygen-and nitrogen-containing heterocycles with very encouraging biological properties, especially as antitumor agents [6][7][8][9].",

Many crucial factors must be considered, including: chemical stability, synthetic difficulty, chemical complexity and diversity, ADMET properties, cost, chemical novelty and intellectual property issues, and 'biological appropriateness'. With regard to the latter point, natural products offer an outstanding source of biologically active molecules that provide many useful features that enable us to design innovative, biologically biased, synthetic compounds. This article outlines the recent approaches in this area and suggests a simple metric to assess synthetic compounds for natural product likeness.",

Diversity-oriented synthesis can give access to new chemotypes with high chemical diversity, exploiting complexity-generating reactions and divergent approaches. However, there is a need for new tools to drive synthetic efforts towards unexplored and biologically relevant regions of chemical space. Because the number of publicly accessible biological data will increase in the years to come, cheminformatics can represent a real opportunity to develop better chemical libraries. This minireview focuses on novel cheminformatics approaches used to design molecular scaffolds, as well as to analyze their quality, giving a perspective of them in the field of chemical biology and drug discovery through some selected case studies.",

Nature synthesizes a rich structural diversity of small molecules, however, unfortunately, there are some disadvantages with using natural product sources for diverse small-molecule discovery. Nevertheless we have a lot to learn from nature. The efficient chemical synthesis of structural diversity (and complexity) is the aim of DOS. Highlights of this article include a discussion of nature's and synthetic chemists' strategies to obtain structural diversity and an analysis of molecular descriptors used to classify compounds. The assessment of how successful one diversity-oriented synthesis is vs another is subjective; therefore we use freely available software (www.cheminformatics.org/diversity) to assess structural diversity in any combinatorial synthesis.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

Many tumors are defective in the tumor suppressor p53 and therefore lack a functional G(1) checkpoint. In these tumors, however, the S-G(2) checkpoints remain intact and, in response to DNA damage, arrest cell cycle progression allowing time for DNA repair. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a key element in the DNA damage response pathway and plays a crucial role in the S-G(2)-phase checkpoints. Inhibiting Chk1 represents a therapeutic strategy for creating a \"synthetic lethal\" response by overriding the last checkpoint defense of tumor cells against the lethal damage induced by DNA-directed chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1 inhibition is consistent with emerging targeted therapies aiming to exploit molecular differences between normal and cancer cells. Adding a Chk1 inhibitor to DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy selectively targets tumors with intrinsic checkpoint defects while minimizing toxicity in checkpoint-competent normal cells. PF-00477736 was identified as a potent, selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor that inhibits Chk1 with a K(i) of 0.49 nM.

Although the clinical development of the first generation of Chk1 antagonists was hindered by off-target effects and an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile, a new wave of early clinical trials with more selective compounds are currently being carried out.

In response to DNA damage, cells are arrested in multiple checkpoints in the cell cycle to allow the damaged DNA to be repaired before progressing into mitosis. Normal cells are arrested in the G1 phase mediated by the p53 tumor suppressor, and p53-deficient cancer cells are arrested in the S or G2 phase. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk 1) is a serine / threonine protein kinase and a key mediator in the DNA damage-induced checkpoint network. When the G2 or S checkpoint is abrogated by the inhibition of Chk1, p53-deficient cancer cells undergo mitotic catastrophe and eventually apoptosis, whereas normal cells are still arrested in the G1 phase. Thus, Chk1 inhibitors can preferentially potentiate the efficacy of DNA damaging agents in cancer cells, and Chk1 is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer treatment, especially since approximately 50% of all human cancers are p53-deficient.

The initial CHK1 inhibitor staurosporine analog, UCN01, entered clinical trials whilst it was still considered to act via PKC inhibition; only later were trials performed in a more focused fashion to determine whether CHK1 inhibition could dysregulate cell cycle checkpoints. Many of the subsequently synthesized more specific CHK1 inhibitors have failed because of poor PK/PD or cumulative normal tissue toxicities in patients. CHK1 inhibitor monotherapy often demonstrates limited efficacy and in general, must be combined with other agents. The combination of CHK1 inhibitors with modern signaling regulators may be a better therapeutic strategy.<bAreas covered</b: This review discusses the history of, and translational use of CHK1 inhibitors; the latest generation of CHK1 inhibitors to enter clinic development are also examined.<bExpert opinion</b: Some CHK1 inhibitors can be administered safely, but that when they are combined with traditional cytotoxic DNA damaging agents, the normal tissue toxicities outweigh the very modest gains in therapeutic efficacy.

One focus of pharmaceutical development has been the inhibition of DNA damage signaling, and checkpoint kinases (Chks) in particular, as a means to sensitize proliferating tumor cells to chemotherapies that damage DNA. 7-Hydroxystaurosporine, or UCN-01, is a clinically relevant and well-studied kinase activity inhibitor that exerts chemosensitizing effects by inhibition of Chk1, and a multitude of Chk1 inhibitors have entered development. Clinical development of UCN-01 has overcome many initial obstacles, but the drug has nevertheless failed to show a high level of clinical activity when combined with chemotherapeutic agents. One very likely reason for the lack of clinical efficacy of Chk1 inhibitors may be that the inhibition of Chk1 causes the compensatory activation of ATM and ERK1/2 pathways. Indeed, inhibition of many enzyme activities, not necessarily components of cell cycle regulation, may block Chk1 inhibitor-induced ERK1/2 activation and enhance the toxicity of Chk1 inhibitors. This review examines the rationally hypothesized actions of Chk1 inhibitors as cell cycle modulatory drugs as well as the impact of Chk1 inhibition upon other cell survival signaling pathways. An understanding of Chk1 inhibition in multiple signaling contexts will be essential to the therapeutic development of Chk1 inhibitors.",

The theory relies on the observation that the majority of tumors are deficient in the G1-DNA damage checkpoint pathway resulting in reliance on S and G2 checkpoints for DNA repair and cell survival. The S and G2 checkpoints are regulated by checkpoint kinase 1, a serine/threonine kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage; thus, inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling impairs DNA repair and increases tumor cell death. Normal tissues, however, have a functioning G1 checkpoint signaling pathway allowing for DNA repair and cell survival. Here, we describe the preclinical profile of AZD7762, a potent ATP-competitive checkpoint kinase inhibitor in clinical trials. AZD7762 has been profiled extensively in vitro and in vivo in combination with DNA-damaging agents and has been shown to potentiate response in several different settings where inhibition of checkpoint kinase results in the abrogation of DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. Dose-dependent potentiation of antitumor activity, when AZD7762 is administered in combination with DNA-damaging agents, has been observed in multiple xenograft models with several DNA-damaging agents, further supporting the potential of checkpoint kinase inhibitors to enhance the efficacy of both conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy and increase patient response rates in a variety of settings.",

Using a focused library of 51 DNA-damaging agents, we undertook a systematic screen using three different cell lines to determine which chemotherapeutics have their activity enhanced when combined with GNE-783. We found that GNE-783 was most effective at enhancing activity of antimetabolite-based DNA-damaging agents; however, there was a surprisingly wide range of activity within each class of agents. We, next, selected six different therapeutic agents and screened these in combination with GNE-783 across a panel of cell lines. This revealed a preference for enhanced chemopotentiation of select agents within tumor types, as, for instance, GNE-783 preferentially enhanced the activity of temozolomide only in melanoma cell lines. Additionally, although p53 mutant status was important for the overall response to combinations with some agents; our data indicate that this alone was insufficient to predict synergy. We finally compared the ability of a structurally related CHK1 inhibitor, GNE-900, to enhance the in vivo activity of gemcitabine, CPT-11, and temozolomide in xenograft models. GNE-900 significantly enhanced activity of only gemcitabine in vivo, suggesting that strong chemopotentiation in vitro can translate into chemopotentiation in vivo.

Genetic inactivation of ATR and Chk1 abrogates cell cycle arrest and enhances cytotoxicity following exposure to DNA-damaging agents. Similar effects were seen with small-molecule Chk1 inhibitors in preclinical studies, and clinical trial data are starting to emerge. Recently, potent ATR inhibitors have been identified that also sensitise cancer cells in vitro. ATR and Chk1 inhibitors might also cause 'synthetic lethality' in tumour cells defective in defined DNA repair pathways.",

High-throughput screening of purified human chk2 led to the identification of a novel series of 2-arylbenzimidazole inhibitors of the kinase. Optimization was facilitated using homology models of chk2 and docking of inhibitors, leading to the highly potent 2-arylbenzimidazole 2h (IC(50) 15 nM). Compound 2h is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of chk2 that dose dependently protects human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells from apoptosis due to ionizing radiation.

The role of checkpoint kinases is to respond to stress, typically damaged DNA or aberrant chromosomal structure, and stop the cell division process long enough for the damage to be repaired. These \"checkpoints\" prevent cells from dividing and perpetuating mutations or chromosomal anomalies that would otherwise lead to cellular lethality. The rationale for inhibiting checkpoint kinases is to accumulate irreparable and fatal genetic lesions by compromising the DNA damage response (DDR) and forcing premature or untimely cell division. Notable examples include the mitotic checkpoint kinases Aurora A and B, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), CHK2, ATR, and WEE1.\n\nSeveral CHK1 inhibitors have been employed in early stage clinical trials [1,2]. Notably, MK-8776 (also referred to as SCH-900776), a CHK1-selective inhibitor, is under evaluation in phase I studies in combination with gemcitabine or cytarabine [3]. Only one inhibitor of WEE1 has been explored clinically. MK-1775, a potent and selective inhibitor of WEE1, achieved favorable phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints in combination with carboplatin, cisplatin, and gemcitabine, and is under further investigation as a chemosensitizer in a phase II trial [4].\n\nCHK1 is an essential serine/threonine kinase involved in S-and G2/M-phase checkpoints [5][6][7][8][9], replication initiation and fork stability [10][11][12], homologous recombination repair [13,14], and entry into mitosis in normal cycling cells [15]. Importantly, CHK1 is necessary for unperturbed DNA replication and cell cycle coordination even in the absence of any exogenous insult [16]. The cytotoxic nature of CHK1 knockdown or inhibition, either alone or in combination with DNAdamaging therapeutics, has been described extensively (for review, see [2]).",

In cancer, the genes encoding these proteins are often disrupted and cause unrestrained cancer growth. The proteins are over-expressed in many malignancies; thus, they are potential targets for anti-cancer therapies. These proteins include cyclin-dependent kinase, checkpoint kinase, WEE1 kinase, aurora kinase and polo-like kinase. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are the most advanced cell-cycle checkpoint therapeutics available. For instance, palbociclib (PD0332991) is a first-in-class, oral, highly selective inhibitor of CDK4/6 and, in combination with letrozole (Phase II; PALOMA-1) or with fulvestrant (Phase III; PALOMA-3), it has significantly prolonged progression-free survival, in patients with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, in comparison with that observed in patients using letrozole, or fulvestrant alone, respectively. In this review, we provide an overview of the current compounds available for cell-cycle checkpoint protein-directed therapy for solid tumors. ",

DNA-damaging chemotherapy and radiation activate functional cellular checkpoints. These checkpoints can facilitate DNA repair and promote cell death in unrepaired cells. There are at least three DNA damage checkpoints - at G1/S, S, and G2/M - as well as a mitotic spindle checkpoint. Most cancer cells harbour mutations in tumour suppressors and/or oncogenes, which impair certain cell checkpoints. Inhibiting the remaining cell checkpoints - particularly after exposure of cancer cells to chemotherapy and/or radiation - allows cell death, a strategy now being employed in cancer therapeutics. With our increasing knowledge of cell cycle regulation, many compounds have been developed to inhibit specific checkpoint components, particularly at the G2/M transition. One such target is checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1). We review here the molecular framework of the cell cycle, the rationale for targeting Chk1, the preclinical concepts related to the development of Chk1 inhibitors, and the efficacy and safety results from Chk1 inhibitors now in phase I/II trials.",

Checkpoint kinase inhibitors are exciting molecules and hold promise in the treatment of both solid and hematologic malignancies. Herein, we discuss preclinical and clinical studies with this class of molecules. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of check point kinase 1 (CHK-1) in DNA repair and provide a comprehensive summary of pre-clinical and early phase clinical trials with CHK-1 inhibitors.

In addition, there might be an additive role in combining this class of molecules to PARP inhibitors, platinum chemotherapy, or radiation therapy in p53 or BRCA mutated tumors.

Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug.

Though highly interrelated, identification of active scaffolds should be conceptually separated from drug design.

Nevertheless, current drug design also takes into consideration other relevant processes than influence drug efficacy and safety (e.g., bioavailability, metabolic stability, interaction with antitargets).This chapter provides an overview on possible approaches to identify active scaffolds (including in silico approximations to approach that task) and computational methods to guide the subsequent optimization process.

In more recent times important developments in theory have led to a different type of modelling becoming possible, the so-called de novo or automated design algorithms. In this new method the programs perform much of the chemist's thinking, in finding appropriately sized chemical groups to fit into a target site. However this is a combinatoric problem which has no general analytical solution; it is ripe for optimization. Other advances, such as combinatorial chemical synthesis and screening, will dramatically influence the search for new lead structures for target sites, which at present are poorly understood. Already these methods are being applied to peptide libraries. Peptides do not make good drug compounds because of their poor bioavailability; further, their flexibility reduces their affinity.

The relative strength of binding of different macrocycles was obtained from the binding energy calculated by the molecular docking method (Table S3). The higher negative binding energy corresponds to the higher binding of the molecule with the protein, and this has further been confirmed experimentally through fluorescence study. The binding constant calculated through the fluorescence quenching study is in relative concurrence with the binding energy values from the molecular docking study, with few exceptions. Thus, the preliminary docking studies are helpful to predict the functional groups and ring size, which could give better binding with the protein. As a positive control, the docking with the well-known drug ibuprofen was also calculated, and the binding constant with BSA protein is already reported 31 . The change in functional groups and ring size rationally resulted in bringing the binding constant of the macrocycle to the range of the binding constant of Ibuprofen (Table 2). An about 25-fold increase in the binding constant was made from macrocycle 2 (binding constant: (1.66 \u00b1 0.32) \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) to macrocycle 6 (binding constant: (39.43 \u00b1 1.02) \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 ) by the systematic change in the functional group and ring size ( Table 2).

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Only a single known reference compound is required to have the computer come up with suggestions for potentially isofunctional molecules. A specific feature of the algorithm is its capability to propose a synthesis plan for each designed compound, based on a large set of readily available molecular building blocks and established reaction protocols. The de novo design software provides rapid access to tool compounds and starting points for the development of a lead candidate structure. The manuscript gives a detailed description of the algorithm.

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in next-generation drug discovery.",

The strength of this initiative is the ability to connect chemists and biologists for the development of hits. This development involves the synthesis of analogues or/and chemical tools to find new targets. These collaborations lead to the identification of new chemical probes. These probes able to modulate a biological function are essential to study biological pathways. They can also be useful for therapeutic applications.

Recently, there has been a revitalization of interest in the inclusion of these chemotypes in compound collections for screening and achieving selective target modulation. Here we discuss natural-product-inspired drug discovery with a focus on recent advances in the design of synthetically tractable small molecules that mimic nature's chemistry. We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in next-generation drug discovery.",
