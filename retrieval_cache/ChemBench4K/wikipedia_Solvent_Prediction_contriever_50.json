In essence, the reaction rates are influenced by differential solvation of the starting material and transition state by the solvent. When the reactant molecules proceed to the transition state, the solvent molecules orient themselves to stabilize the transition state. If the transition state is stabilized to a greater extent than the starting material then the reaction proceeds faster. If the starting material is stabilized to a greater extent than the transition state then the reaction proceeds slower. However, such differential solvation requires rapid reorientational relaxation of the solvent (from the transition state orientation back to the ground-state orientation). Thus, equilibrium-solvent effects are observed in reactions that tend to have sharp barriers and weakly dipolar, rapidly relaxing solvents.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

It is closely related to semustine and is in the same family as streptozotocin. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug, thus it crosses the blood-brain barrier. This property makes it ideal for treating brain tumors, which is its primary use, although it is also used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma as a second-line option. Lomustine has a long time to nadir (the time when white blood cells reach their lowest number).",

This is one of the few cases where the single bond symbol - is required. (In fact, most SMILES software can correctly infer that the bond between the two rings cannot be aromatic and so will accept the nonstandard form c1ccccc1c2ccccc2.)

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC.

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

That is, F\\C=C\\F is the same as F/C=C/F. When alternating single-double bonds are present, the groups are larger than two, with the middle directional symbols being adjacent to two double bonds. For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written C/C=C/C=C/C. As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C. Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with @@ and @, respectively (because the @ symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).",

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

Studies show, however, that in the hydroxide deprotonates one NH3 ligand to give the conjugate base of the starting complex, i.e., [Co(NH3)4(NH2)Cl]+. In this monocation, the chloride spontaneously dissociates from this conjugate base of the starting complex. This pathway is called the Sn1CB mechanism.

In this system, the standard Diels-Alder reaction is a (4 + 2)-cycloaddition, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is a (3 + 2)-cycloaddition and cyclopropanation of a carbene with an alkene a (2 + 1)-cycloaddition. A more recent, IUPAC-preferred notation, first introduced by Woodward and Hoffmann, uses square brackets to indicate the number of electrons, rather than carbon atoms, involved in the formation of the product. In the [i + j + ...] notation, the standard Diels-Alder reaction is a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition, while the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is also a [4 + 2]-cycloaddition.",

The \"butterfly mechanism\" takes place via a transition state geometry in which the plane of the peracid bisects that of the alkene, with the O–O bond aligned perpendicular to it. This conformation allows the key frontier orbital interactions to occur. The primary interaction of the occupied πC=C orbital (HOMO) and the low-lying unoccupied σ*O-O orbital (LUMO). This interaction accounts for the observed overall nucleophilic character and electrophilic character of the alkene and peracid, respectively. There is also a secondary interaction between a lone pair orbital perpendicular to the plane of the peracid, nO(p) (HOMO) and the unoccupied π*C=C orbital (LUMO). Using the approach of Anslyn and Dougherty (2006, p. 556), the mechanism can be represented as follows: There is a very large dependence of the reaction rate on the choice of solvent. References",

Illustrative is the preparation of zinc carbonate: ZnCl2(aq) + Na2CO3(aq) → ZnCO3(s) + 2 NaCl(aq) Applications",

In organometallic chemistry the nucleophilic abstraction reaction occurs with a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Unsaturated carbon centres Nucleophilic substitution via the SN1 or SN2 mechanism does not generally occur with vinyl or aryl halides or related compounds. Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article. When the substitution occurs at the carbonyl group, the acyl group may undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. This is the normal mode of substitution with carboxylic acid derivatives such as acyl chlorides, esters and amides. References External links",

Multiple lines can be merged into a syntactical line by writing a \\ (backslash) at the end of each line. This allows for breaking a long line into multiple lines, for example in a reaction with each molecule on its own line.

For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

Therefore, if the concentration of A at some arbitrary stage of the reaction is [A], then it will have fallen to [A] after a further interval of (ln 2)/k. Hence, the half-life of a first order reaction is given as the following: The half-life of a first order reaction is independent of its initial concentration and depends solely on the reaction rate constant, k. Second order kinetics: In the second order reactions, the concentration of the reactant decrease following this formula: Then, we replace [A] for [A]0 in order to calculate the half-life of the reactant A and isolate the time of the half-life (t1/2): As you can see, the half-life of the second order reactions depends on the initial concentration and rate constant.",

This allows for breaking a long line into multiple lines, for example in a reaction with each molecule on its own line.

The normal solvents of choice are both polar (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and protic solvents (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

Unsaturated carbon centres Nucleophilic substitution via the SN1 or SN2 mechanism does not generally occur with vinyl or aryl halides or related compounds. Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article. When the substitution occurs at the carbonyl group, the acyl group may undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution.

This basic solvent system is sometimes referred to as the HEMWat solvent system. The choice of solvent system may be guided by perusal of the CCC literature. The familiar technique of thin layer chromatography may also be employed to determine an optimal solvent system. The organization of solvent systems into \"families\" has greatly facilitated the choice of solvent systems as well. A solvent system can be tested with a one-flask partitioning experiment. The measured partition coefficient from the partitioning experiment will indicate the elution behavior of the compound. Typically, it is desirable to choose a solvent system where the target compound(s) have a partition coefficient",

The normal solvents of choice are both polar (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and protic solvents (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

Vigorous mixing of the phases is critical in order to maximize the interfacial area between them and enhance mass transfer. The analyte will distribute between the phases according to its partition coefficient which is also called the distribution coefficient, distribution constant, or partition ratio and is represented by P, K, D, Kc, or KD. The partition coefficient for an analyte in a particular biphasic solvent system is independent of the volume of the instrument, flow rate, stationary phase retention volume ratio and the g-force required to immobilize the stationary phase. The degree of stationary phase retention is a crucial parameter. Common factors that influence stationary phase retention are flow rate, solvent composition of the biphasic solvent system, and the g-force. The stationary phase retention is",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Although the reference compound for 19F NMR spectroscopy, neat CFCl3 (0 ppm), has been used since the 1950s, clear instructions on how to measure and deploy it in routine measurements were not present until recently. An investigation of the factors influencing the chemical shift in fluorine NMR spectroscopy revealed the solvent to have the largest effect (Δδ = ±2 ppm or more). A solvent-specific reference table with 5 internal reference compounds has been prepared (CFCl3, C6H5F, PhCF3, C6F6 and CF3CO2H) to allow reproducible referencing with an accuracy of Δδ = ±30 ppb. As the chemical shift of CFCl3 is also affected by the solvent, care must be taken when using dissolved CFCl3 as reference compound with regards to the chemical shift of neat CFCl3 (0 ppm).

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

This basic solvent system is sometimes referred to as the HEMWat solvent system. The choice of solvent system may be guided by perusal of the CCC literature. The familiar technique of thin layer chromatography may also be employed to determine an optimal solvent system. The organization of solvent systems into \"families\" has greatly facilitated the choice of solvent systems as well. A solvent system can be tested with a one-flask partitioning experiment.

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: (C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

One of its SMILES forms is NC(C)C(=O)O, more fully written as N[CH](C)C(=O)O. L-Alanine, the more common enantiomer, is written as N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

Rings Ring structures are written by breaking each ring at an arbitrary point (although some choices will lead to a more legible SMILES than others) to make an acyclic structure and adding numerical ring closure labels to show connectivity between non-adjacent atoms. For example, cyclohexane and dioxane may be written as C1CCCCC1 and O1CCOCC1 respectively. For a second ring, the label will be 2. For example, decalin (decahydronaphthalene) may be written as C1CCCC2C1CCCC2.",

Also, it is permitted to reuse ring numbers after the first ring has closed, although this usually makes formulae harder to read. For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C. Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with @@ and @, respectively (because the @ symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).",

For example, of the four currently recognized KCl transporters, KCC1 and KCC4 both recognize KCl with similar affinities, but KCC1 exhibits anion selectivity: Cl− > SCN− = Br− > PO > I−, while KCl4 exhibits anion selectivity: Cl− > Br− > PO = I− > SCN−. Both are activated by cell swelling under hypotonic conditions. These proteins may cotransport water (H2O). CCCs share a conserved structural scaffold that consists of a transmembrane transport domain followed by a cytoplasmic regulatory domain. Warmuth et al. (2009) determined the x-ray structure of the C-terminal domain of a CCC from the archaeon Mehanosarcina acetivorans (). It shows a novel fold of a regulatory domain, distantly related to universal stress proteins. The protein forms dimers in solution, consistent with the proposed dimeric organization of eukaryotic CCC transporters.",

So, a question arises: can NaCl or KCl from deicing salts still possibly play a role in the alkali-silica reaction? and cations in themselves cannot attack silica (the culprit is their counter ion ) and soluble alkali chlorides cannot produce soluble alkali hydroxide by interacting with calcium hydroxide. So, does it exist another route to still produce hydroxide anions in the hardened cement paste (HCP)? Beside portlandite, other hydrated solid phases are present in HCP. The main phases are the calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) (the \"glue\" in cement paste), calcium sulfo-aluminate phases (AFm and AFt, ettringite) and hydrogarnet. C-S-H phases are less soluble (~ 10−5 M) than portlandite (CH) (~ 2.2 10−2 M at 25 °C) and therefore are expected to play a negligible role for the calcium ions release.",

For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written C/C=C/C=C/C. As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C.

Dissociation degree The dissociation degree is the fraction of original solute molecules that have dissociated. It is usually indicated by the Greek symbol α. More accurately, degree of dissociation refers to the amount of solute dissociated into ions or radicals per mole. In case of very strong acids and bases, degree of dissociation will be close to 1. Less powerful acids and bases will have lesser degree of dissociation. There is a simple relationship between this parameter and the van 't Hoff factor . If the solute substance dissociates into ions, then For instance, for the following dissociation KCl <=> K+ + Cl- As , we would have that . Salts The dissociation of salts by solvation in a solution like water means the separation of the anions and cations. The salt can be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.",

Cu(s) + Cl2(g) → CuCl2(l) It is also commercially practical to combine copper(II) oxide with an excess of ammonium chloride at similar temperatures, producing copper chloride, ammonia, and water: CuO + 2NH4Cl → CuCl2 + 2NH3 + H2O Although copper metal itself cannot be oxidised by hydrochloric acid, copper-containing bases such as the hydroxide, oxide, or copper(II) carbonate can react to form CuCl2 in an acid-base reaction.

The normal solvents of choice are both polar (to stabilize ionic intermediates in general) and protic solvents (to solvate the leaving group in particular). Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material. The following table shows the relative solvolysis rates of tert-butyl chloride with acetic acid (CH3CO2H), methanol (CH3OH), and water (H2O).",

Alkali from the cement might react with the dolomite crystals present in the aggregate inducing the production of brucite, (MgOH)2, and calcite (CaCO3). This mechanism was tentatively proposed by Swenson and Gillott (1964) and may be written as follows: CaMg(CO3)2 + 2 NaOH -> Mg(OH)2 + CaCO3 + Na2CO3 Brucite (Mg(OH)2), could be responsible for the volumetric expansion after de-dolomitisation of the aggregates, due to absorption of water. The alkali–carbonate reaction is also catalyzed by the soluble NaOH produced by the reaction of with (portlandite) present in the hardened cement paste (HCP), therefore perpetuating the reaction indefinitely as observed by Fournier and Bérubé (2000) and Bérubé et al.

Unsaturated carbon centres Nucleophilic substitution via the SN1 or SN2 mechanism does not generally occur with vinyl or aryl halides or related compounds. Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Thus, the equilibrium can be defined as: [CS] = Keq[C]. For industrial scale uses, the total binding molecules on the column resin beads must be factored in because unoccupied sites must be taken into account. The Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm are useful in describing this equilibrium. Langmuir Isotherm: [CS] = (KeqStot[C])/(1 + Keq[C]), where Stot is the total binding molecules on the beads. Freundlich isotherm: [CS] = Keq[C]1/n The Freundlich isotherm is used when the column can bind to many different samples in the solution that needs to be purified. Because the many different samples have different binding constants to the beads, there are many different Keqs. Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm is not a good model for binding in this case.",

ANC is then defined by collecting all species controlled by equilibrium (i.e. species related to weak acids and weak bases) on one side and species not controlled by equilibrium (i.e. species related to strong acids and strong bases) on the other side.

This conformation allows the key frontier orbital interactions to occur. The primary interaction of the occupied πC=C orbital (HOMO) and the low-lying unoccupied σ*O-O orbital (LUMO). This interaction accounts for the observed overall nucleophilic character and electrophilic character of the alkene and peracid, respectively. There is also a secondary interaction between a lone pair orbital perpendicular to the plane of the peracid, nO(p) (HOMO) and the unoccupied π*C=C orbital (LUMO).

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

The hydrolysis of [Co(NH3)5Cl]2+ follows second order kinetics: the rate increases linearly with concentration of hydroxide as well as the starting complex. Studies show, however, that in the hydroxide deprotonates one NH3 ligand to give the conjugate base of the starting complex, i.e., [Co(NH3)4(NH2)Cl]+. In this monocation, the chloride spontaneously dissociates from this conjugate base of the starting complex. This pathway is called the Sn1CB mechanism.

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

Synthesis Dichloroisocyanuric acid is manufactured by chlorination of cyanuric acid: (C(O)NH)3 + 2 Cl2 → (C(O)NCl)2(C(O)NH) + 2 HCl It is a colourless solid. Mechanism of action Dichloroisocyanuric acid is an oxidizer, reacting with water to form chlorine gas. Although the bleaching agent in most chlorine based bleach is sodium hypochlorite, the sodium salt of dichloroisocyanuric acid, sodium dichloroisocyanurate, is the active ingredient in commercial disinfectant bacteriocides, algicides, and cleaning agents such as the pulverized cleanser Comet.

Both are activated by cell swelling under hypotonic conditions. These proteins may cotransport water (H2O). CCCs share a conserved structural scaffold that consists of a transmembrane transport domain followed by a cytoplasmic regulatory domain. Warmuth et al. (2009) determined the x-ray structure of the C-terminal domain of a CCC from the archaeon Mehanosarcina acetivorans ().

It enhances respiration by acting as an agonist of peripheral chemoreceptors located on the carotid bodies. The drug increases arterial oxygen tension while decreasing arterial carbon dioxide tension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It may also prove useful in the treatment of nocturnal oxygen desaturation without impairing the quality of sleep. A significant literature exists for this compound, including over 60 papers that Medline labels as reviews.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: (C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

An intermediate is cyclopentadienylchromium tricarbonyl dimer: 2 Cr(C5H5)2 + 6 CO → [Cr(C5H5)(CO)3]2 + \"(C5H5)2\" Chromocene provides a convenient route for preparing the anhydrous form of chromium(II) acetate, a useful precursor to other chromium(II) compounds.

The current continuation is given by replacing (call/cc f) by a variable c bound by a lambda abstraction, so the current continuation is (lambda (c) (c e2)). Applying the function f to it gives the final result (f (lambda (c) (c e2))).",

This is one of the few cases where the single bond symbol - is required. (In fact, most SMILES software can correctly infer that the bond between the two rings cannot be aromatic and so will accept the nonstandard form c1ccccc1c2ccccc2.) The Daylight and OpenEye algorithms for generating canonical SMILES differ in their treatment of aromaticity. Branching Branches are described with parentheses, as in CCC(=O)O for propionic acid and FC(F)F for fluoroform.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C. Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with @@ and @, respectively (because the @ symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).",

As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C.

The solubility of another chlorine solvent, carbon tetrachloride, at 0 °C is about 30% (3.11 mol/L). One mole of C4Cl6 can dissolve more chlorine than one mole of CCl4, but the molecular weight difference between the two solvents is such that per liter of solvent, more chlorine can be dissolved in carbon tetrachloride.

Direct reactions of ligands with the cluster often lead to complex product distributions because the inert Os–CO bonds require high temperatures to break, and at such high temperatures the initially formed adducts react further. More successfully, Os3(CO)12 is converted to more labile derivatives such as Os3(CO)11(MeCN) and Os3(CO)10(MeCN)2 using Me3NO as a decarbonylating agent. Os3(CO)11(MeCN) reacts with a variety of even weakly basic ligands to form adducts such as Os3(CO)11(ethylene) and Os3(CO)11(pyridine). The direct reaction of Os3(CO)12 with ethylene and pyridine results in degradation of these organic ligands to give the vinyl hydride HOs3(CO)10(η1,η2-C2H3) and the pyridyl-hydride HOs3(CO)10(NC5H4).

For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

Double, triple, and quadruple bonds are represented by the symbols =, #, and $ respectively as illustrated by the SMILES O=C=O (carbon dioxide ), C#N (hydrogen cyanide HCN) and [Ga+]$[As-] (gallium arsenide). An additional type of bond is a \"non-bond\", indicated with ., to indicate that two parts are not bonded together. For example, aqueous sodium chloride may be written as [Na+].[Cl-] to show the dissociation. An aromatic \"one and a half\" bond may be indicated with :; see below. Single bonds adjacent to double bonds may be represented using / or \\ to indicate stereochemical configuration; see below.",

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

Branching Branches are described with parentheses, as in CCC(=O)O for propionic acid and FC(F)F for fluoroform. The first atom within the parentheses, and the first atom after the parenthesized group, are both bonded to the same branch point atom.

Such collisions, which contribute the energy to the reactant, are necessarily second order. The rate of these collisions is however masked by the fact that the rate determining step remains the unimolecular breakdown of the energized reactant. The half-life is independent of the starting concentration and is given by . Examples of such reactions are: 2N2O5 -> 4NO2 + O2 [CoCl(NH3)5]^2+ + H2O -> [Co(H2O)(NH3)5]^3+ + Cl- H2O2 -> H2O + 1/2O2",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction).

This conformation allows the key frontier orbital interactions to occur. The primary interaction of the occupied πC=C orbital (HOMO) and the low-lying unoccupied σ*O-O orbital (LUMO). This interaction accounts for the observed overall nucleophilic character and electrophilic character of the alkene and peracid, respectively. There is also a secondary interaction between a lone pair orbital perpendicular to the plane of the peracid, nO(p) (HOMO) and the unoccupied π*C=C orbital (LUMO).

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

One of its SMILES forms is NC(C)C(=O)O, more fully written as N[CH](C)C(=O)O. L-Alanine, the more common enantiomer, is written as N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction).

A flow-through model was subsequently developed and the new technique was called countercurrent chromatography in 1970. The technique was further developed by employing test mixtures of DNP amino acids in a chloroform:glacial acetic acid:0.1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (2:2:1 v/v) solvent system. Much development was needed to engineer the instrument so that required planetary motion could be sustained while the phases were being pumped through the coil(s). Parameters such as the relative rotation of the two axes (synchronous or non-synchronous), the direction of flow through the coil, and the rotor angles were investigated.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds.

In organometallic chemistry the nucleophilic abstraction reaction occurs with a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Unsaturated carbon centres Nucleophilic substitution via the SN1 or SN2 mechanism does not generally occur with vinyl or aryl halides or related compounds. Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article. When the substitution occurs at the carbonyl group, the acyl group may undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. This is the normal mode of substitution with carboxylic acid derivatives such as acyl chlorides, esters and amides. References External links",

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: (C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

However, this flocculated CSNCs then can be precipitated out from the solution by exploiting gravitational force or by means of centrifugation. This precipitated CSNCs, separated from impurities, then redispersed in a clean solvent. By repeating this process multiple times, purer form of CSNCs can be achieved. Through this method, a refine size distributed CSNCs can be found by adding a minimum amount of antisolvent until the point when the flocculation of CSNCs just begin to occur instead of fully precipitated the CSNCs.",

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter.

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

This basic solvent system is sometimes referred to as the HEMWat solvent system. The choice of solvent system may be guided by perusal of the CCC literature. The familiar technique of thin layer chromatography may also be employed to determine an optimal solvent system. The organization of solvent systems into \"families\" has greatly facilitated the choice of solvent systems as well. A solvent system can be tested with a one-flask partitioning experiment.

Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter. For example, 100% ethanol gives Y = −2.3, 50% ethanol in water Y = +1.65 and 15% concentration Y = +3.2.

As such, solvent conditions significantly affect the performance of a reaction with certain solvent conditions favoring one reaction mechanism over another. For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction. There are many different termination combinations, some examples are: Union of methyl radicals from a C-C bond leading to ethane (a side product). CH3. + CH3. -> CH3-CH3",

This basic solvent system is sometimes referred to as the HEMWat solvent system. The choice of solvent system may be guided by perusal of the CCC literature. The familiar technique of thin layer chromatography may also be employed to determine an optimal solvent system. The organization of solvent systems into \"families\" has greatly facilitated the choice of solvent systems as well. A solvent system can be tested with a one-flask partitioning experiment.

For SN1 reactions the solvent's ability to stabilize the intermediate carbocation is of direct importance to its viability as a suitable solvent. The ability of polar solvents to increase the rate of SN1 reactions is a result of the polar solvent's solvating the reactant intermediate species, i.e., the carbocation, thereby decreasing the intermediate energy relative to the starting material.

As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C. Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with @@ and @, respectively (because the @ symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

Lomustine has a long time to nadir (the time when white blood cells reach their lowest number).",

For example, the hydrolysis of esters by dilute mineral acids follows pseudo-first order kinetics where the concentration of water is present in large excess: CH3COOCH3 + H2O → CH3COOH + CH3OH The hydrolysis of sucrose (C12H22O11) in acid solution is often cited as a first-order reaction with rate r = k[C12H22O11]. The true rate equation is third-order, r = k[C12H22O11][H+][H2O]; however, the concentrations of both the catalyst H+ and the solvent H2O are normally constant, so that the reaction is pseudo–first-order.

Protic solvents react with strong nucleophiles with good basic character in an acid/base fashion, thus decreasing or removing the nucleophilic nature of the nucleophile. The following table shows the effect of solvent polarity on the relative reaction rates of the SN2 reaction of 1-bromobutane with azide (N3–). There is a noticeable increase in reaction rate when changing from a protic solvent to an aprotic solvent. This difference arises from acid/base reactions between protic solvents (not aprotic solvents) and strong nucleophiles. While it is true that steric effects also affect the relative reaction rates, however, for demonstration of principle for solvent polarity on SN2 reaction rates, steric effects may be neglected.",
