This reaction mechanism for acetaldehyde has 4 steps with rate equations for each step : Initiation : CH3CHO → •CH3 + •CHO (Rate=k1 [CH3CHO]) Propagation: CH3CHO + •CH3 → CH4 + CH3CO• (Rate=k2 [CH3CHO][•CH3]) Propagation: CH3CO• → •CH3 + CO (Rate=k3 [CH3CO•]) Termination: •CH3 + •CH3 → CH3CH3 (Rate=k4 [•CH3]2) For the overall reaction, the rates of change of the concentration of the intermediates •CH3 and CH3CO• are zero, according to the steady-state approximation, which is used to account for the rate laws of chain reactions. d[•CH3]/dt = k1[CH3CHO] – k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] + k3[CH3CO•] - 2k4[•CH3]2 = 0",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2.

For example, for the combustion of methane, CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O: ΔrH⦵ = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − [ΔfH⦵(CH4) + 2 ΔfH⦵(O2)]. However O2 is an element in its standard state, so that ΔfH⦵(O2) = 0, and the heat of reaction is simplified to ΔrH⦵ = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − ΔfH⦵(CH4), which is the equation in the previous section for the enthalpy of combustion ΔcombH⦵.",

The converse is also true; the standard enthalpy of reaction is positive for an endothermic reaction.

Chemical ionization can also be used to identify and quantify an analyte present in a sample, by coupling chromatographic separation techniques to CI such as gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE).

This may be solved to find the steady-state concentration of •CH3 radicals as [•CH3] = (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]1/2. It follows that the rate of formation of CH4 is d[CH4]/dt = k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] = k2 (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]3/2 Thus the mechanism explains the observed rate expression, for the principal products CH4 and CO.

Consider the following reaction scheme. Assuming that there is a steady-state carbanion concentration in the mechanism, the rate law for an E1cB mechanism.",

This suggests that the rate is determined by a step in which two molecules react, with the CO molecule entering at another, faster, step. A possible mechanism in two elementary steps that explains the rate equation is: + → NO + (slow step, rate-determining) + CO → + (fast step) In this mechanism the reactive intermediate species is formed in the first step with rate r1 and reacts with CO in the second step with rate r2. However, can also react with NO if the first step occurs in the reverse direction (NO + → 2 ) with rate r−1, where the minus sign indicates the rate of a reverse reaction.",

The converse is also true; the standard enthalpy of reaction is positive for an endothermic reaction. This calculation has a tacit assumption of ideal solution between reactants and products where the enthalpy of mixing is zero. For example, for the combustion of methane, CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O: ΔrH⦵ = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − [ΔfH⦵(CH4) + 2 ΔfH⦵(O2)]. However O2 is an element in its standard state, so that ΔfH⦵(O2) = 0, and the heat of reaction is simplified to ΔrH⦵ = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − ΔfH⦵(CH4), which is the equation in the previous section for the enthalpy of combustion ΔcombH⦵.",

The \"butterfly mechanism\" takes place via a transition state geometry in which the plane of the peracid bisects that of the alkene, with the O–O bond aligned perpendicular to it. This conformation allows the key frontier orbital interactions to occur. The primary interaction of the occupied πC=C orbital (HOMO) and the low-lying unoccupied σ*O-O orbital (LUMO). This interaction accounts for the observed overall nucleophilic character and electrophilic character of the alkene and peracid, respectively. There is also a secondary interaction between a lone pair orbital perpendicular to the plane of the peracid, nO(p) (HOMO) and the unoccupied π*C=C orbital (LUMO). Using the approach of Anslyn and Dougherty (2006, p. 556), the mechanism can be represented as follows: There is a very large dependence of the reaction rate on the choice of solvent. References",

This reaction is proposed to proceed via the intermediacy of phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene: PhNHOH + PhNO → PhN(O)NPh + H2O Another option is the oxidation of aniline by hydrogen peroxide, in acetonitrile at 50 ºC. In this reaction, the pH should be kept around 8, to activate the hydrogen peroxide and avoid too much oxygen evolution at the same time. First, the acetonitrile is oxidized, forming an imine hydroperoxide. Then, this intermediate oxidizes the aniline to azoxybenzene.

The first atom within the parentheses, and the first atom after the parenthesized group, are both bonded to the same branch point atom. The bond symbol must appear inside the parentheses; outside (E.g.: CCC=(O)O) is invalid.",

The standard enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcH⊖, for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH2 group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of ΔcH⊖ than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable. Reactions with halogens",

This may be solved to find the steady-state concentration of •CH3 radicals as [•CH3] = (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]1/2. It follows that the rate of formation of CH4 is d[CH4]/dt = k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] = k2 (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]3/2 Thus the mechanism explains the observed rate expression, for the principal products CH4 and CO.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

Based on this information, the reactions would appear to proceed via nucleophilic attack of hydroxide at cobalt. Studies show, however, that the hydroxide deprotonates one NH3 ligand to give the conjugate base of the starting complex, i.e., [Co(NH3)4(NH2)Cl]+.

If the potential sinks of O2 greatly outweighed the sources, then the atmosphere would have been nearly devoid of O2. In the prebiotic atmosphere, O2 was produced by the photolysis of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere: CO_2 + h\\nu -> CO + O H_2O + h\\nu -> 1/2O_2 + 2H These reactions aren't necessarily a net source of O2. If the CO and O produced from CO2 photolysis remain in the atmosphere, then they will eventually recombine to make CO2. Likewise, if the H and O2 from H2O photolysis remain in the atmosphere, then they will eventually react to form H2O.

Although these reactions are complex, they can be described by this simplified equation: Nb2(OC2H5)10 + 5 H2O → Nb2O5 + 10 HOEt The thermal decomposition of Nb(OC2H5)5 begins above 325 – 350 °C. This can be observed with QMS as an increasing amount of ethanol and ethane released. Diethyl ether, C2H5OC2H5, and niobium(V) oxide are the decomposition products released following an atomic layer deposition or chemical vapor deposition process.

For catalysts such as [Ru(H)2(CO)(PR3)3] which are active as Ru0, a combination of computational density functional studies and experimental evidence has resulted in the following proposed mechanism: It is proposed that at high temperatures RuH2(CO)(PPh3)3 converts to an unsaturated Ru(CO)(PPh3)n species. The catalytic cycle is proposed to begins with coordination of the ketone followed by oxidative addition of a C-H bond.

This conformation allows the key frontier orbital interactions to occur. The primary interaction of the occupied πC=C orbital (HOMO) and the low-lying unoccupied σ*O-O orbital (LUMO). This interaction accounts for the observed overall nucleophilic character and electrophilic character of the alkene and peracid, respectively. There is also a secondary interaction between a lone pair orbital perpendicular to the plane of the peracid, nO(p) (HOMO) and the unoccupied π*C=C orbital (LUMO). Using the approach of Anslyn and Dougherty (2006, p. 556), the mechanism can be represented as follows: There is a very large dependence of the reaction rate on the choice of solvent. References",

The general equation for complete combustion is: CnH2n+2 + (n + ) O2 → (n + 1) H2O + n CO2 or CnH2n+2 + () O2 → (n + 1) H2O + n CO2 In the absence of sufficient oxygen, carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed, as shown below: CnH2n+2 + (n + ) O2 → (n + 1) H2O + n CO CnH2n+2 + (n + ) O2 → (n + 1) H2O + n C For example, methane: 2 CH4 + 3 O2 → 4 H2O + 2 CO CH4 + O2 → 2 H2O + C See the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data. The standard enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcH⊖, for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH2 group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of ΔcH⊖ than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable. Reactions with halogens",

This reaction is proposed to proceed via the intermediacy of phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene: PhNHOH + PhNO → PhN(O)NPh + H2O Another option is the oxidation of aniline by hydrogen peroxide, in acetonitrile at 50 ºC. In this reaction, the pH should be kept around 8, to activate the hydrogen peroxide and avoid too much oxygen evolution at the same time. First, the acetonitrile is oxidized, forming an imine hydroperoxide. Then, this intermediate oxidizes the aniline to azoxybenzene.

The reduction reaction CuO + H2 →Cu + H2O is highly exothermic and should be conducted in dry gas for an optimal result. As for the HTS catalyst mechanism, two similar reaction mechanisms are suggested. The first mechanism that was proposed for the LTS reaction was a redox mechanism, but later evidence showed that the reaction can proceed via associated intermediates. The different intermediates that is suggested are: HOCO, HCO and HCOO. In 2009 there are in total three mechanisms that are proposed for the water-gas shift reaction over Cu(111), given below. Intermediate mechanism (usually called associative mechanism): An intermediate is first formed and then decomposes into the final products: Associative mechanism: CO2 produced from the reaction of CO with OH without the formation of an intermediate:",

It can be prepared by the reduction of copper(II) sulfate with sodium bisulfite at 60 °C, followed by the addition of sodium cyanide to precipitate pure LT-CuCN as a pale yellow powder. 2 CuSO4 + NaHSO3 + H2O + 2 NaCN → 2 CuCN + 3 NaHSO4 On addition of sodium bisulfite the copper sulfate solution turns from blue to green, at which point the sodium cyanide is added. The reaction is performed under mildly acidic conditions. Copper cyanide has historically been prepared by treating copper(II) sulfate with sodium cyanide, in this redox reaction, copper(I) cyanide forms together with cyanogen: 2 CuSO4 + 4 NaCN → 2 CuCN + (CN)2 + 2 Na2SO4",

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction.

First, kinetic studies of reactions between diazomethane and various ketones have shown that the overall reaction follows second order kinetics. Additionally, the reactivity of two series of ketones are in the orders Cl3CCOCH3 > CH3COCH3 > C6H5COCH3 and cyclohexanone > cyclopentanone > cycloheptanone > cyclooctanone.

This reaction mechanism for acetaldehyde has 4 steps with rate equations for each step : Initiation : CH3CHO → •CH3 + •CHO (Rate=k1 [CH3CHO]) Propagation: CH3CHO + •CH3 → CH4 + CH3CO• (Rate=k2 [CH3CHO][•CH3]) Propagation: CH3CO• → •CH3 + CO (Rate=k3 [CH3CO•]) Termination: •CH3 + •CH3 → CH3CH3 (Rate=k4 [•CH3]2) For the overall reaction, the rates of change of the concentration of the intermediates •CH3 and CH3CO• are zero, according to the steady-state approximation, which is used to account for the rate laws of chain reactions. d[•CH3]/dt = k1[CH3CHO] – k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] + k3[CH3CO•] - 2k4[•CH3]2 = 0",

Without catalysts, surface reactions leading to the formation of SiO are generally very slow and only occur at exceptionally high temperatures. Typical catalysts for SiO ALD include Lewis bases such as NH or pyridine and SiO; ALD can also be initiated when these Lewis bases are coupled with other silicon precursors such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Hydrogen bonding is believed to occur between the Lewis base and the SiOH* surface species or between the HO based reactant and the Lewis base. Oxygen becomes a stronger nucleophile when the Lewis base hydrogen bonds with the SiOH* surface species because the SiO-H bond is effectively weakened. As such, the electropositive Si atom in the SiCl reactant is more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

Also, it is permitted to reuse ring numbers after the first ring has closed, although this usually makes formulae harder to read. For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

The combustion of methane (CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O) is equivalent to the sum of the hypothetical decomposition into elements followed by the combustion of the elements to form carbon dioxide and water: CH4 → C + 2 H2 C + O2 → CO2 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O Applying Hess's law, ΔcombH⦵(CH4) = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − ΔfH⦵(CH4).

If the standard enthalpy of the products is less than the standard enthalpy of the reactants, the standard enthalpy of reaction is negative. This implies that the reaction is exothermic. The converse is also true; the standard enthalpy of reaction is positive for an endothermic reaction. This calculation has a tacit assumption of ideal solution between reactants and products where the enthalpy of mixing is zero. For example, for the combustion of methane, CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O: ΔrH⦵ = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − [ΔfH⦵(CH4) + 2 ΔfH⦵(O2)].

Like most transition metal carbonates, cobalt carbonate is insoluble in water, but is readily attacked by mineral acids: CoCO3 + 2 HCl + 5 H2O → [Co(H2O)6]Cl2 + CO2 It is used to prepare many coordination complexes. The reaction of cobalt(II) carbonate and acetylacetone in the presence of hydrogen peroxide gives tris(acetylacetonato)cobalt(III).

Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

Ni(C5H5)2 + 4 PF3 → Ni(PF3)4 + organic products The reaction with secondary phosphines follows a similar pattern: 2 Ni(C5H5)2 + 2 PPh2H → [Ni2(PPh2)2(C5H5)2] + 2 C5H6 Nickelocene can be oxidized to the corresponding cation, which contains Ni(III). Gaseous Ni(C5H5)2 decomposes to a nickel mirror upon contact with a hot surface, releasing the hydrocarbon ligands as gaseous coproducts. This process has been considered as a means of preparing nickel films. Nickelocene reacts with nitric acid to produce cyclopentadienyl nickel nitrosyl, a highly toxic organonickel compound.

If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

CT = [CO2*] + [] + [] where, CT is the total inorganic carbon [CO2*] is the sum of carbon dioxide and carbonic acid concentrations ( [CO2*] = [CO2] + [H2CO3]) [] is the bicarbonate concentration [] is the carbonate concentration Each of these species are related by the following pH-driven chemical equilibria: CO2 + H2O H2CO3 H+ + 2 H+ + The concentrations of the different species of DIC (and which species is dominant) depends on the pH of the solution, as shown by a Bjerrum plot.",

The standard enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcH⊖, for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH2 group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of ΔcH⊖ than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable. Reactions with halogens",

Of all the parameters influencing reaction rates, temperature is normally the most important one and is accounted for by the Arrhenius equation.

For an elementary (single-step) reaction, the order with respect to each reactant is equal to its stoichiometric coefficient.

Approximately 50% of the heat required to drive this reaction can be captured from the reaction itself. The other heat can be provided by any suitable process. Recent research has focused on a cogeneration scheme using the waste heat from nuclear reactors, specifically the CANDU supercritical water reactor.",

The experimental reaction order is 3/2, which can be explained by a Rice-Herzfeld mechanism. This reaction mechanism for acetaldehyde has 4 steps with rate equations for each step : Initiation : CH3CHO → •CH3 + •CHO (Rate=k1 [CH3CHO]) Propagation: CH3CHO + •CH3 → CH4 + CH3CO• (Rate=k2 [CH3CHO][•CH3]) Propagation: CH3CO• → •CH3 + CO (Rate=k3 [CH3CO•]) Termination: •CH3 + •CH3 → CH3CH3 (Rate=k4 [•CH3]2) For the overall reaction, the rates of change of the concentration of the intermediates •CH3 and CH3CO• are zero, according to the steady-state approximation, which is used to account for the rate laws of chain reactions. d[•CH3]/dt = k1[CH3CHO] – k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] + k3[CH3CO•] - 2k4[•CH3]2 = 0",

Since precursors with multiple functional groups polymerize into networks of covalent C-C bonds (on average 85 kcal/mol), networks formed by self-assembly, which relies on secondary forces (generally less than 10 kcal/mol), are less stable., Theorists also have difficulties predicting characteristic gelation parameters, such as gel point and gelation time, with a single and simple equation.

For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written C/C=C/C=C/C. As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C.

The standard enthalpy change of combustion, ΔcH⊖, for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH2 group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of ΔcH⊖ than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable. Reactions with halogens",

In both polymorphs the copper to carbon and copper to nitrogen bond lengths are ~1.85 Å and bridging cyanide groups show head-to-tail disorder. Preparation Cuprous cyanide is commercially available and is supplied as the low-temperature polymorph. It can be prepared by the reduction of copper(II) sulfate with sodium bisulfite at 60 °C, followed by the addition of sodium cyanide to precipitate pure LT-CuCN as a pale yellow powder. 2 CuSO4 + NaHSO3 + H2O + 2 NaCN → 2 CuCN + 3 NaHSO4 On addition of sodium bisulfite the copper sulfate solution turns from blue to green, at which point the sodium cyanide is added. The reaction is performed under mildly acidic conditions. Copper cyanide has historically been prepared by treating copper(II) sulfate with sodium cyanide, in this redox reaction, copper(I) cyanide forms together with cyanogen: 2 CuSO4 + 4 NaCN → 2 CuCN + (CN)2 + 2 Na2SO4",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene.

When moving from fluorine to chlorine, then to bromine, the electronegativity of the halogen and the energy level of the σ*(C–X) orbitals decreases. Consequently, the general trend of acceptors can be summarized as: π*(C=O)>σ*(C–Hal)>σ*(C–O)>σ*(C–N)>σ*(C–C), σ*(C–H). For donating orbitals, the nonbonding orbitals, or the lone pairs, are generally more effective than bonding orbitals due to the high energy levels. Also, different from acceptors, donor orbitals require less polarized bonds. Thus, the general trends for donor orbitals would be: n(N)>n(O)>σ(C–C), σ(C–H)>σ(C–N)>σ(C–O)>σ(C–S)>σ(C–Hal).",

It consists of two electron-withdrawing components, the chlorosulfonyl group (SO2Cl) and the isocyanate group (-N=C=O). Because of its resulting electrophilicity, the use of CSI in chemical synthesis requires relatively inert solvents such as chlorocarbons, acetonitrile, and ethers. Uses The molecule has two electrophilic sites, the carbon and the S(VI) center.",

The conditions vary from acid to acid, but phosphorus pentoxide is a common dehydrating agent: 2 CH3COOH + P4O10 → CH3C(O)OC(O)CH3 + \"P4O9(OH)2\" Acid chlorides are also effective precursors: CH3C(O)Cl + HCO2Na → HCO2COCH3 + NaCl Mixed anhydrides containing the acetyl group are prepared from ketene: RCO2H + H2C=C=O → RCO2C(O)CH3",

Hess’s Law: Addition of Thermochemical Equations Hess’s Law states that the sum of the energy changes of all the thermochemical equations included in an overall reaction is equal to the overall energy change. Since ΔH is a state function and so is not dependent on how the reactants become the products, we can use several steps (in the form of several thermochemical equations) to find the ΔH of the overall reaction. Example: Reaction (1) C(graphite, s) + O2(g) → CO2(g) This reaction comes about via two steps (a reaction sequence): C(graphite, s) + ½O2(g) → CO(g) ΔH = −110.5 kJ CO(g) + ½O2(g) → CO2(g) ΔH = −283.0 kJ We want to add these two reactions together to get Reaction (1) so that we can find ΔH, so we check to make sure that agents in the reaction sequence not present in (1) cancel each other. In this example, CO(g) is not in (1) and cancels. We add the reaction sequence together.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

This reaction mechanism for acetaldehyde has 4 steps with rate equations for each step : Initiation : CH3CHO → •CH3 + •CHO (Rate=k1 [CH3CHO]) Propagation: CH3CHO + •CH3 → CH4 + CH3CO• (Rate=k2 [CH3CHO][•CH3]) Propagation: CH3CO• → •CH3 + CO (Rate=k3 [CH3CO•]) Termination: •CH3 + •CH3 → CH3CH3 (Rate=k4 [•CH3]2) For the overall reaction, the rates of change of the concentration of the intermediates •CH3 and CH3CO• are zero, according to the steady-state approximation, which is used to account for the rate laws of chain reactions. d[•CH3]/dt = k1[CH3CHO] – k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] + k3[CH3CO•] - 2k4[•CH3]2 = 0",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

That is, F\\C=C\\F is the same as F/C=C/F. When alternating single-double bonds are present, the groups are larger than two, with the middle directional symbols being adjacent to two double bonds. For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written C/C=C/C=C/C. As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C. Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise.

Models suggest that, without wildfires removing shade-casting trees and shrubs, there would be no space for C4 plants. But, wildfires have occurred for 400 million years – why did C4 take so long to arise, and then appear independently so many times? The Carboniferous period (~) had notoriously high oxygen levels – almost enough to allow spontaneous combustion – and very low , but there is no C4 isotopic signature to be found.

Approximately 50% of the heat required to drive this reaction can be captured from the reaction itself. The other heat can be provided by any suitable process. Recent research has focused on a cogeneration scheme using the waste heat from nuclear reactors, specifically the CANDU supercritical water reactor.",

Typical polar protic solvents include water and alcohols, which will also act as nucleophiles and the process is known as solvolysis. The Y scale correlates solvolysis reaction rates of any solvent (k) with that of a standard solvent (80% v/v ethanol/water) (k0) through with m a reactant constant (m = 1 for tert-butyl chloride) and Y a solvent parameter.

This charge stabilization can cause any potential concerted pathway to become asynchronous and approaches intermediates with oxocarbenium character of the SN1 mechanism for glycosylation.

As seen in Figure 2, while mass after calcination remains constant, the mass change upon carbonation- the carrying capacity- reduces with a large number of cycles. In calcination, porous CaO (molar volume = ) is formed in place of CaCO3 (.). On the other hand, in carbonation, the CaCO3 formed on the surface of a CaO particle occupies a larger molar volume. As a result, once a layer of carbonate has formed on the surface (including on the large internal surface of porous CaO), it impedes further CO2 capture.

The concept of the rate-determining step is very important to the optimization and understanding of many chemical processes such as catalysis and combustion. Example reaction: + CO As an example, consider the gas-phase reaction + CO → NO + .

When moving from fluorine to chlorine, then to bromine, the electronegativity of the halogen and the energy level of the σ*(C–X) orbitals decreases. Consequently, the general trend of acceptors can be summarized as: π*(C=O)>σ*(C–Hal)>σ*(C–O)>σ*(C–N)>σ*(C–C), σ*(C–H). For donating orbitals, the nonbonding orbitals, or the lone pairs, are generally more effective than bonding orbitals due to the high energy levels. Also, different from acceptors, donor orbitals require less polarized bonds. Thus, the general trends for donor orbitals would be: n(N)>n(O)>σ(C–C), σ(C–H)>σ(C–N)>σ(C–O)>σ(C–S)>σ(C–Hal).",
