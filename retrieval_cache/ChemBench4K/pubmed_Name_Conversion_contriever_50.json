A joint experimental and theoretical study (energies calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) suggests that the neutral radical CCC(O)Ph rearranges via a four-centred ipso radical cyclisation/ring opening to form the isomer PhCCCO in an exothermic reaction. (13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

Whereas this process is strongly exoergic, there is a high-energy barrier to this rearrangement process. On the other hand, when a second water molecule is added to the complex, it can shuttle protons from the donor part of the complex to the acceptor, and thereby greatly reduce the rearrangement energy barrier. In the case of CCH + 2H2O, this barrier is computed to be less than 4 kcal x mol(-1).",

Here we studied the expression of c-MYC in correlation to clinical outcome in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. <bMethods:</b The current study, using immunohistochemical staining, first examined c-MYC expression in OSCC patients and further correlated its expression with clinicopathological parameters. <bResults:</b c-MYC was expressed in the majority of OSCC patients (n=133). The c-MYC expression is associated with histological grade (<iP</i=0.0205) of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that TN stage (<iP</i&lt;0.001), American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (<iP</i&lt;0.0001), and tumor differentiation (<iP</i=0.0025) were independent factors for overall survival in patients with OSCC except for c-MYC expression (<iP</i&gt;0.05). Multiplicative-scale interaction between T stage (III/IV) and low c-MYC expression on mortality risk was identified (<iP</i=0.0233). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that oral cancer patients (T III/IV stage) with high c-MYC expression had better survival than those with low and medium c-MYC expression (<iP</i=0.0270). <bConclusion:</b Our data indicate that c-MYC is a potential biomarker that can be used as a therapeutic target for treating OSCC patients with T stage (III/IV).",

On both sets, it achieved a success rate of over 95% in interpreting the correct chemical structures, outperforming other programs under our evaluation.

Due to the complexity of this ruleset a correct chemical name assignment remains challenging for human beings and there are only a few rule-based cheminformatics toolkits available that support this task in an automated manner. Here we present STOUT (SMILES-TO-IUPAC-name translator), a deep-learning neural machine translation approach to generate the IUPAC name for a given molecule from its SMILES string as well as the reverse translation, i.e. predicting the SMILES string from the IUPAC name. In both cases, the system is able to predict with an average BLEU score of about 90% and a Tanimoto similarity index of more than 0.9. Also incorrect predictions show a remarkable similarity between true and predicted compounds.",

When 1 was tested in preclinical studies, cataract formation was observed in rats; however, this compound was metabolized extensively in vivo and showed low systemic exposure. To eliminate this side effect and enhance bioavailability, structural modification was focused on replacing the methoxy group of 1 by modulating lipophilicity (i.e., predicted log D at pH 7.4). The SARs led to the discovery of 4-[5-fluoro-3-[4-(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzyloxy]phenyl]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-carboxamide (10, CJ-13,454), which was less lipophilic by 1.2 log D units and showed in vivo potency (ED(50) = 4-9 mg/kg) equipotent to 1. Enhanced metabolic stability resulted in fewer in vivo metabolites, as well as improved bioavailability and a better toxicological profile. Thus, 10 was found to be a more practical lead for an orally active 5-LO inhibitor.",

Structure-activity relationship exploration resulted in the identification of a 3-[3-ethyl-5-(6-phenylpyridin-3-yl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl]-2-methylbenzonitrile (14u) compound with markedly higher selectivity for GlyT1. Physiochemical studies revealed that 14u exists as a stable pair of atropisomers under physiological conditions. We successfully separated the atropisomers to obtain active enantiomer (R)-14u, which displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, as well as positive results in the mice Y-maze test. ",

Infants (N = 13) from 1 to 6 months of age were videotaped weekly for 5 min in 208 face-to-face interactions with their mothers. Levels of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling were correlated within interactive sessions, and the 2 smiles had similar developmental trajectories.

The results suggest these frequently contrasted types of smiles occur in similar situations and are often different temporal phases of a continuous emotional process.

An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS.

However, only a small number of applications are freely available to identify such mentions. Particularly challenging and useful is the identification of International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) chemical compounds, which due to the complex morphology of IUPAC names requires more advanced techniques than that of brand names. We present CheNER, a tool for automated identification of systematic IUPAC chemical mentions. We evaluated different systems using an established literature corpus to show that CheNER has a superior performance in identifying IUPAC names specifically, and that it makes better use of computational resources. http://metres.udl.cat/index.php/9-download/4-chener, http://chener.bioinfo.cnio.es/",

Infants (N = 13) from 1 to 6 months of age were videotaped weekly for 5 min in 208 face-to-face interactions with their mothers. Levels of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling were correlated within interactive sessions, and the 2 smiles had similar developmental trajectories. Duchenne smiles were typically preceded by non-Duchenne smiles. The results suggest these frequently contrasted types of smiles occur in similar situations and are often different temporal phases of a continuous emotional process.

Results of assays after intraligamentary injections were then compared with results of assays after intravenous injections of plain drug in the same subjects. Both formulations of local anaesthetic were found as peak levels in the circulation, presumably after intraosseous spread, by 2 minutes following the intraligamentary injections.

Infants (N = 13) from 1 to 6 months of age were videotaped weekly for 5 min in 208 face-to-face interactions with their mothers. Levels of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling were correlated within interactive sessions, and the 2 smiles had similar developmental trajectories.

Due to the complexity of this ruleset a correct chemical name assignment remains challenging for human beings and there are only a few rule-based cheminformatics toolkits available that support this task in an automated manner. Here we present STOUT (SMILES-TO-IUPAC-name translator), a deep-learning neural machine translation approach to generate the IUPAC name for a given molecule from its SMILES string as well as the reverse translation, i.e. predicting the SMILES string from the IUPAC name. In both cases, the system is able to predict with an average BLEU score of about 90% and a Tanimoto similarity index of more than 0.9.

The new trioxide is obtained from the gas-phase photolytic reaction of CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CF(3) and FC(O)C(O)F at 223-228 K. It is a very thermally labile molecule that decomposes at room temperature by rupture of either of the CF(3)OC(O)O-O-OC(O)F bonds. These bonds are nonequivalent, and a branching ratio of 0.8 for fragmentation through the CF(3)OC(O)OO-OC(O)F bond was obtained. Unambiguous identification was possible through reaction of the trioxide with an excess of NO(2). Potential-energy surfaces (PES) of the different rotamers were studied by the B3LYP/6-311+G* method, and analysis of the IR frequency of the possible mixture of rotamers agrees excellently with the experimental IR spectrum. This molecule is the first nonsymmetric acyl trioxide reported in the literature.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Infants (N = 13) from 1 to 6 months of age were videotaped weekly for 5 min in 208 face-to-face interactions with their mothers. Levels of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling were correlated within interactive sessions, and the 2 smiles had similar developmental trajectories.

The results suggest these frequently contrasted types of smiles occur in similar situations and are often different temporal phases of a continuous emotional process.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The physiological oligomeric state and how it contributes to protein function are central to understanding CEACAMs. Two putative dimer conformations involving different CEACAM1 N-terminal Ig-like domain (CCM1) protein faces (ABED and GFCC'C″) were identified from crystal structures.

In the crystalline state, the compound consists of C4mim(+) cations and triangular [CuCl3](2-) anions and forms three different modifications, which are connected through phase transitions at 227 and 203 K. The high and intermediate temperature phases crystallise in the space group C2, whereas the low temperature phase exhibits the space group P21. The three crystal structures are related through an isomorphic and a klassengleiche symmetry transition, respectively. The solid undergoes congruent melting at 320 K. The enthalpy of fusion was determined to be 25.7 kJ mol(-1). The melting process is irreversible and the ionic liquid can be supercooled to its glass transition at 221 K. ",

It was shown that CCl3 radicals add oxygen to form CCl3O2 radicals, which eventually yield three chloride ions and CO2. A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations. The rate constant for the oxygen addition to CCl3 radicals was determined by pulse radiolysis to 3.3 X 10(9) M-1 s-1.

The quadratic force constants and the stretching potentials of Hn CCHn have been calculated at the CASSCF/cc-pVTZ level. The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

Infants (N = 13) from 1 to 6 months of age were videotaped weekly for 5 min in 208 face-to-face interactions with their mothers. Levels of Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling were correlated within interactive sessions, and the 2 smiles had similar developmental trajectories.

The results suggest these frequently contrasted types of smiles occur in similar situations and are often different temporal phases of a continuous emotional process.

The mRNA level of Dmp-1 gene was down-regulated; however, OCN gene expression was up-regulated by the culture of dental pulp cells with type I collagen. These findings imply that type I collagen regulates mRNA level of Dmp-1 and OCN gene that are predominantly expressed in active odontoblasts. The change of gene expression by type I collagen was suppressed by the blocking of collagen-integrin interaction. We could conclude that the effect of type I collagen was mediated via binding of collagen to integrin receptors.",

We show that the Cu(II) atom in Pf-CopC is coordinated by two His residues, an Asp residue and the N-terminus of the protein (therefore a 3N + O site). This coordination structure is consistent with all structurally characterized proteins from the CopC family to date. Structural and sequence analyses of the CopC family allow a relationship between protein sequence and the Cu(II) binding affinity of these proteins to be proposed.",

The mRNA level of Dmp-1 gene was down-regulated; however, OCN gene expression was up-regulated by the culture of dental pulp cells with type I collagen. These findings imply that type I collagen regulates mRNA level of Dmp-1 and OCN gene that are predominantly expressed in active odontoblasts. The change of gene expression by type I collagen was suppressed by the blocking of collagen-integrin interaction.

The molecular conformations and electronic structure of these three compounds were investigated by HeI photoelectron spectroscopy, photoionization mass spectroscopy, FT-IR, and theoretical calculations. They were theoretically predicted to prefer the [ss-c] conformation, with each C═O bond syn with respect to the opposite O-C bond and the C═C bond in cis orientation to the adjacent C═O bond. The experimental first vertical ionization potential for CH(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), and CCl(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2) was determined to be 10.91, 11.42, and 11.07 eV, respectively.

Short intermolecular O···Cl distances between 2.401 and 2.938 Å reveal the formation of a new class of complexes. The interaction energies calculated with the G2(MP2) method range between -9.1 (nF = 4) and -26.0 (nF = 0) kJ/mol. The charge transfer occurring from the ethers to atomic Cl is moderate and ranges between 0.012 e (nF = 4) to 0.188 e (nF = 0). The binding energies are linearly related to the proton affinity, to the charge transfer (CT) occurring in the molecular system and inversely proportional to the ionization potential and electron affinity (IP-EA) values. The CT and spin density data indicate substantial two-center-three-electron O···Cl interaction in CH3OCH3···Cl and CH3OCH2F···Cl systems, whereas for highly fluorinated ethers the interaction is predominantly electrostatic in nature. The formation of the complex results in a contraction of the CH bonds, especially in the gauche position. The blue shifts of the C-H stretching vibrations calculated in the partially deuterated isotopomers range between 2 and 54 cm(-1) and are correlated to the variation of the CH distances. ",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The current definition of the mole shows a certain ambiguity regarding the nature of the quantity \"amount of substance\". The proposed new definition removes the ambiguity, but at a cost: it becomes difficult to justify treating amount of substance as having its own dimension, and hence its own unit, the mole. I argue that the difficulties with amount of substance result from its role as a mediator between macroscopic and microscopic scales. To understand why amount of substance might have its own dimension, we need to connect amount of substance to mass, contra current proposals to separate them.",

Due to the complexity of this ruleset a correct chemical name assignment remains challenging for human beings and there are only a few rule-based cheminformatics toolkits available that support this task in an automated manner. Here we present STOUT (SMILES-TO-IUPAC-name translator), a deep-learning neural machine translation approach to generate the IUPAC name for a given molecule from its SMILES string as well as the reverse translation, i.e. predicting the SMILES string from the IUPAC name. In both cases, the system is able to predict with an average BLEU score of about 90% and a Tanimoto similarity index of more than 0.9. Also incorrect predictions show a remarkable similarity between true and predicted compounds.",

An experimental study has demonstrated that this reaction occurs under very mild conditions, with significant conversion being observed at 255 K. At lower temperatures, evidence for a transient metallo-enol ester species Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(OC{Me}O-C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) was obtained. A comprehensive theoretical study to probe the nature of the alkyne/vinylidene tautomerisation has been undertaken using Density Functional Theory. Calculations based on a number of isomers of the model system Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHMe)(PH(3))(2) demonstrate that both the η(2)(CC) alkyne complex Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(η(2)-HC≡CMe)(PH(3))(2) and the C-H agostic σ-complex Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(η(2){CH}-HC≡CMe)(PH(3))(2) are minima on the potential energy surface. The lowest energy pathway for the formation of the vinylidene complex involves the intramolecular deprotonation of the σ-complex by an acetate ligand followed by reprotonation of the subsequently formed alkynyl ligand. This process is thus termed a Ligand-Assisted Proton Shuttle (LAPS). Calculations performed on the full experimental system Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) reinforce the notion that lowest energy pathway involves the deprotonation/reprotonation of the alkyne by an acetate ligand. Inclusion of the full ligand substituents in the calculations are necessary to reproduce the experimental observation of Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) as the thermodynamic product.",

The steady-state concentrations of •OH and SO<sub4</sub<sup•-</sup (including other reactive species) were determined using both chemical probes and modeling methods (Kintecus® V6.8). In the UV/PS, the dye degradation depends on the pH of the solution with the order: k<subdye</sub (at pH of 7) &gt; k<subdye</sub (in acidic conditions) &gt; k<subdye</sub (in alkaline conditions). The presence of water matrices had different impacts on dye degradation: 1) The HCO<sub3</sub<sup-</sup and Cl<sup-</sup promoted the degradation efficiency of one dye, but also inhibited the degradation of other dyes; 2) Humic acid (HA) inhibited dye degradation as it scavenged both •OH and SO<sub4</sub<sup•-</sup. The degradation of the dyes by UV/PS was also compared with the UV/Chlorine (UV/HOCl) and UV/H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub and it was established that: 1) In UV/PS and UV/HOCl, SO<sub4</sub<sup•-</sup and RCS contributed to dye degradation more than •OH, while •OH played a major role in dye degradation by UV/H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub; 2) The calculated toxicity in UV/PS was the lowest probably due to the low toxicity of by-products; 3) For MeO and RhB, the UV/PS process is more beneficial for the total organic carbon (TOC) removal compared to that of the UV/HOCl and UV/H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub processes; 4) The UV/PS showed lower cost than the UV/HOCl and UV/H<sub2</subO<sub2</sub systems for MeO, and RhB degradation but higher cost for MeB removal.",

Proteins that have been identified as GDF-11 inhibitors include GDF-associated serum protein-1 (GASP-1) and GASP-2. Recently, we found that mice genetically engineered to lack both <iGasp1</i and <iGdf11</i have an increased frequency of cleft palate. The goal of this study was to investigate the roles of GDF-11 and its inhibitors, GASP-1 and GASP-2, during dental and craniofacial development and growth. Mouse genetic studies were used in this study. Homozygous knockout mice for <iGasp1</i (<iGasp1<sup-/-</sup</i ) and <iGasp2</i (<iGasp2<sup-/-</sup</i ) were viable and fertile, but <iGdf11</i homozygous knockout (<iGdf11<sup-/-</sup</i ) mice died within 24 hours after birth. The effect of either <iGasp1</i or <iGasp2</i deletion in <iGdf11<sup-/-</sup</i mice during embryogenesis was evaluated in <iGasp1<sup-/-</sup;Gdf11<sup-/-</sup</i and <iGasp2<sup-/-</sup;Gdf11<sup-/-</sup</i mouse embryos at 18.5 days post-coitum (E18.5). For the analysis of adult tissues, we used <iGasp1<sup-/-</sup;Gdf11<sup+/-</sup</i and <iGasp2<sup-/-</sup;Gdf11<sup+/-</sup</i mice to evaluate the potential haploinsufficiency of <iGdf11</i in <iGasp1<sup-/-</sup</i and <iGasp2<sup-/-</sup</i mice. Although <iGasp2</i expression decreased after E10.5, <iGasp1</i expression was readily detected in various ectodermal tissues at E17.5, including hair follicles, epithelium in nasal cavity, retina, and developing tooth buds. Interestingly, <iGasp1<sup-/-</sup</i ;<iGdf11<sup-/-</sup</i mice had abnormal formation of lower incisors: tooth buds for lower incisors were under-developed or missing. Although <iGdf11<sup+/-</sup</i mice were viable and had mild transformations of the axial skeleton, no specific defects in the craniofacial development have been observed in <iGdf11<sup+/-</sup</i mice. However, loss of <iGasp1</i in <iGdf11<sup+/-</sup</i mice occasionally resulted in small and abnormally shaped auricles. These findings suggest that both GASP-1 and GDF-11 play important roles in dental and craniofacial development both during embryogenesis and in adult tissues.",

We synthesized racemic (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-16-hydroxy-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (16-HETE) which still contains the bisallylic C(13), separated the enantiomers reaching an optical purity of &gt;99% and tested them as substrates for 5- and 15-lipoxygenases. Our synthetic pathway, which is based on stereospecific hydrogenation of a polyacetylenic precursor, yielded substantial amounts (30%) of 14,15-dehydro-16-HETE in addition to 16-HETE. When 16-HETE was tested as lipoxygenase substrate, we found that it is well oxygenated by the soybean 15-lipoxygenase and by the recombinant human 5-lipoxygenase. Analysis of the reaction products suggested an arachidonic acid-like alignment at the active site of the two enzymes. In contrast, the product pattern of 16-HETE methyl ester oxygenation by the soybean lipoxygenase (5-lipoxygenation) may be explained by an inverse head to tail substrate orientation.",
