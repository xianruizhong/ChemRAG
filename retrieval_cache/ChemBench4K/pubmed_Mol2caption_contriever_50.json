Here we describe a novel conserved mitochondrial metallochaperone-like protein, Cmc1p, whose function affects both COX and Sod1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cmc1p localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the intermembrane space. Cmc1p is essential for full expression of COX and respiration, contains a twin CX9C domain conserved in other COX assembly copper chaperones, and has the ability to bind copper(I). Additionally, mutant cmc1 cells display increased mitochondrial Sod1p activity, while CMC1 overexpression results in decreased Sod1p activity.

Unlike the structure of Smc1/Smc3 and Smc1/Scc1 interfaces, that of Smc3/Scc1 is not known. Disconnection of this interface is thought to release cohesin from chromosomes in a process regulated by acetylation. We show here that the N-terminal domain of yeast Scc1 contains two α helices, forming a four-helix bundle with the coiled coil emerging from Smc3's adenosine triphosphatase head. Mutations affecting this interaction compromise cohesin's association with chromosomes. The interface is far from Smc3 residues, whose acetylation prevents cohesin's dissociation from chromosomes. Cohesin complexes holding chromatids together in vivo do indeed have the configuration of hetero-trimeric rings, and sister DNAs are entrapped within these. ",

These isomers were labeled Sm@C(84)(I), Sm@C(84)(II), and Sm@C(84)(III) in order of their elution times during chromatography on a Buckyprep column with toluene as the eluent. Analysis of the structures by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on cocrystals formed with Ni(II)(octaethylporphyrin) reveals the identities of two of the isomers: Sm@C(84)(I) is Sm@C(2)(13)-C(84), and Sm@C(84)(III) is Sm@ D(3d)(19)-C(84). Sm@C(84)(II) can be identified as Sm@C(2)(11)-C(84) on the basis of the similarity of its UV/vis/NIR spectrum with that of Yb@C(2)(11)-C(84), whose carbon cage has been characterized by (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of the three Sm@C(84) isomers identified in this project with two prior reports of the preparation and isolation of isomers of Sm@C(84) indicate that five different Sm@C(84) isomers have been found and that the source of samarium used for the generation of fullerene soot is important in determining which of these isomers form.",

We investigated ion binding and selectivity in CLC-ec1, a H(+)-Cl(-) exchanger of the CLC family of channels and transporters. Cl(-) affinity depends on the conformation of the protein: it is highest with the extracellular gate removed and weakens as the transporter adopts the occluded configuration and with the intracellular gate removed. The central ion-binding site determines selectivity in CLC transporters and channels. A serine-to-proline substitution at this site confers NO(3)(-) selectivity upon the Cl(-)-specific CLC-ec1 transporter and CLC-0 channel.

Hence, CLCs encompass two functional classes of transport proteins once thought to be fundamentally different from one another. In this review, we discuss the structural features and molecular mechanisms of CLC channels and antiporters. We focus on ClC-0, the most thoroughly studied CLC channel, and ClC-ec1, the prokaryotic antiporter of known structure. We highlight some striking similarities between these CLCs and discuss compelling questions that remain to be addressed.

The molecular structure of the complex responsible for the previously observed UV-vis spectrum is recognized as ClSCS, not ClCS(2). Two low-lying excited states of ClSCS, responsible for its optical absorption, have been identified and analyzed. Optical excitation of ClSCS leads to the excitation-specific bond elongation that may lead to photofragmentation of the molecule. In addition, experimental conditions for verifying the presence of ClCS(2) are identified and detailed characterization of its optically active excited states with possible photofragmentation pathways is given.",

On the basis of the same criteria, C(4)O(4) exhibits cyclic electron delocalization due to partial occupancy of the sigma CC bonds. However, the dissociation energies of all the neutral oxocarbons, C(n)()O(n)(), are highly exothermic.",

The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O2COH)]ZnCl(4).3H2O is isolated as a crystalline solid from an acidic solution of the parent carbonate [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4, and X-ray structural analysis shows that lengthening of the C=Oexo bond and shortening of the C-Oendo bond accompanies protonation.

The condition of exactness for n=2 defines nCCSD=2CC, with nCCSDT=3CC and nCCSDTQ=4CC being exact for three and four electrons. To achieve this, the minimum number of diagrams is evaluated, which is less than in the corresponding CC model. For all practical purposes, nCC is also the proper definition of a size-extensive CI. 2CC is also an orbitally invariant coupled electron pair approximation. The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result. As 2CC is exact for separated electron pairs, it is the natural zeroth-order approximation for the correlation problem in molecules with other effects introduced as these units start to interact. The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding. Excited states from the equation of motion (EOM-2CC) are also reported, which show results frequently approaching those of EOM-CCSDT.",

This article provides an extension to the Covalent Bond Classification (CBC) method by categorizing 3c-2e interactions according to whether (i) the two electrons are provided by one or by two atoms and (ii) the central bridging atom provides two, one, or zero electrons. Class I 3c-2e bonds are defined as those in which two atoms each contribute one electron to the 3-centre orbital, while Class II 3c-2e bonds are defined as systems in which the pair of electrons are provided by a single atom. Class I and Class II 3c-2e interactions can be denoted by structure-bonding representations that employ the \"half-arrow\" notation, which also provides a convenient means to determine the electron count at a metal centre. In contrast to other methods of electron counting, this approach provides a means to predict metal-metal bond orders that are in accord with theory. For example, compounds that feature symmetrically bridging carbonyl ligands do not necessarily have to be described as \"ketone derivatives\" because carbon monoxide can also serve as an electron pair donor to two metal centres. This bonding description also provides a simple means to rationalize the theoretical predictions of the absence of M-M bonds in molecules such as Fe(2)(CO)(9) and [CpFe(CO)(2)](2), which are widely misrepresented in textbooks as possessing M-M bonds.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Similar reactions with 13CH2CHCN and CH2CH13CN give [13CCCN]- and [CC13CN]-. Collision induced dissociations of these anions, together with calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory indicate that the anions do not rearrange under conditions used to charge strip them to their neutrals. A comparison of the charge reversal (-CR+) and neutralization/reionization (-NR+) mass spectra of [CCCN]- indicate that neutral C3N species (formed by charge stripping of the anion) decompose by loss of C. Experimental studies with the 13C labeled analogues indicate that the loss of C occurs subsequent to or accompanying partial carbon scrambling of the CCCN backbone. Theoretical studies suggest that this scrambling may occur during equilibration of CCCN and CCNC via a decomposing \"rhombic\" C3N intermediate.",

The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2. Its characterization is discussed along with a possible mechanism for formation and decomposition reactions.",

Leading accounts of addiction in literature fail to offer a mechanism that explains addiction across substances. I discuss popular variants of the disease conception and demonstrate that at least one class of substances that fails to confirm a major prediction of each account. When no mechanism can be found to explain the occurrence of the relevant properties in members of a category, the HPC view suggests that we revise our categories. I discuss options offered by the HPC view, including category revision and category replacement. I then conclude that talk of addiction as a prediction-supporting category should be replaced with categories such as \"S-addiction\" and \"T-addiction,\" where S and T are substances or sets of substances of abuse, as these categories are genuine natural kinds.

Vertices may be single atoms, dimers, coordination polyhedra, clusters of atoms or clusters of coordination polyhedra; edges may be single chemical bonds or sets of several chemical bonds. Thus, a single net may be the basis for a family of structures that are homeomorphic to that net. The coordination of polyhedra or units around a vertex is visualized by connecting the centres of the atoms or groups at the vertices connected with the central vertex. Thus, the concept of coordination number is extended to include coordinating groups. We name a net after a homeomorphic simple structure-type for which there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of the net and specific atoms of the structure, and between the edges of the net and the chemical bonds. We term the resulting more complex structures metastructures in order to distinguish them from their corresponding simple structure-types. Individual metastructures are referred to as alpha structures similar to a particular simple type. Thus, the open complex framework of [V(5)O(9)(PO(4))(2)] composition in microporous Na(v)[((V(4+)(4-w)V(5+)(1+w))O(9))(PO(4))(2)].(PO(4))(x).(OH)(y).zH(2)O is an alpha-NbO structure based on the simple net that is homeomorphic to NbO. This approach is effective in hierarchically classifying both simple close-packed structures and very complicated microporous structures.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

Addition of a second equivalent of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* to this solution results in the formation of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* as well as (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2).

Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution.

Density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method indicates that a second water molecule is required as a catalyst for the addition of water across the C=O bond in H(2)CCO(*+) by eliminating the activation barrier for the conversion of [H(2)CCO.H(2)O](*+) to [H(2)CC(OH)(2)](*+). Theory further indicates that [H(2)CC(OH)(2).H(2)O](*+) may recombine with electrons to produce neutral acetic acid. Experimental results of flow-reactor tandem mass spectrometer experiments in which CH(2)CO(*+) ions were produced either directly from ketene by electron transfer or by the chemical reaction of CH(2)(*+) with CO are consistent with formation of an (C(2),H(4),O(2))(*+) ion in a reaction second-order in H(2)O. Furthermore, comparative multi-CID experiments indicate that this ion is likely to be the enolic CH(2)C(OH)(2)(*+) cation.

However, a remarkable effect was found for the 1O2 quenching by C60, H2@C60, D2@C6o, H2, and D2. Singlet oxygen was generated by photosensitization or by thermal decomposition of naphthalene endoperoxide derivatives. Comparison of the rate constants for quenching of 1O2 by H2@C60 and D2@C60 demonstrates a significant vibrational interaction between oxygen and H2 inside the fullerene.

(13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

In the past two decades, emerging functions for the CCN proteins (CCNs) have been identified in various types of cancer. Perturbed expression of CCNs has been observed in a variety of malignancies. The aberrant expression of certain CCNs is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. Insight into the detailed mechanisms involved in CCN-mediated regulation may be useful in understanding their roles and functions in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis.

Transitions with spin and hyperfine splittings were observed for two isotopologs, CCC(35)Cl and CCC(37)Cl, in the region from 11.4 GHz for N=2-1 to 34.2 GHz for N=6-5. The molecular constants including the hyperfine coupling constants due to the Cl nucleus have been determined precisely.

These isomers were labeled Sm@C(84)(I), Sm@C(84)(II), and Sm@C(84)(III) in order of their elution times during chromatography on a Buckyprep column with toluene as the eluent. Analysis of the structures by single-crystal X-ray diffraction on cocrystals formed with Ni(II)(octaethylporphyrin) reveals the identities of two of the isomers: Sm@C(84)(I) is Sm@C(2)(13)-C(84), and Sm@C(84)(III) is Sm@ D(3d)(19)-C(84). Sm@C(84)(II) can be identified as Sm@C(2)(11)-C(84) on the basis of the similarity of its UV/vis/NIR spectrum with that of Yb@C(2)(11)-C(84), whose carbon cage has been characterized by (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of the three Sm@C(84) isomers identified in this project with two prior reports of the preparation and isolation of isomers of Sm@C(84) indicate that five different Sm@C(84) isomers have been found and that the source of samarium used for the generation of fullerene soot is important in determining which of these isomers form.",

The ground state of this neutral is the singlet cumulene oxide :C=C=C=C=C=C=C=O. The adiabatic electron affinity and dipole moment of singlet C(6)CO are 2.47 eV and 4.13 D, respectively, at this level of theory. The anion (C(6)CO)-* should be a possible precursor to this neutral.

The relatively high vibrational frequencies and the substantial Ng-(C[triple bond]CH) binding energy in these species indicate that these compounds should be fairly stable, at least in cryogenic conditions. These compounds could be a very interesting addition to the range of known organic noble gas compounds. Suggestions are made on possible approaches to their preparation.",

Addition of a second equivalent of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* to this solution results in the formation of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* as well as (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2). Spectroscopic data show that (o-H(2)N)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* loses CO to form [eta(2)-(o-H(2)N)C(6)H(4)S]Cr(CO)(2)Cp*. Attack on the N-H bond of the coordinated amine by (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* provides a reasonable mechanism consistent with the observation that both chelate formation and oxidative addition of the N-H bond are faster under argon than under CO atmosphere. The N-H bonds of uncoordinated aniline do not react with (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp*. Reaction of the 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* with 1,2-benzene dithiol [1,2-C(6)H(4)(SH)(2)] yields the initial product (o-HS)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp and 1 mol of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*.

This reaction also occurs more rapidly under Ar than under CO, consistent with intramolecular coordination of the second thiol group prior to oxidative addition.

The new trioxide is obtained from the gas-phase photolytic reaction of CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CF(3) and FC(O)C(O)F at 223-228 K. It is a very thermally labile molecule that decomposes at room temperature by rupture of either of the CF(3)OC(O)O-O-OC(O)F bonds. These bonds are nonequivalent, and a branching ratio of 0.8 for fragmentation through the CF(3)OC(O)OO-OC(O)F bond was obtained. Unambiguous identification was possible through reaction of the trioxide with an excess of NO(2). Potential-energy surfaces (PES) of the different rotamers were studied by the B3LYP/6-311+G* method, and analysis of the IR frequency of the possible mixture of rotamers agrees excellently with the experimental IR spectrum.

The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

The experimental geometry of ClC(O)OONO(2) is reproduced reasonably well by B3LYP/6-311+G(2df) calculations, whereas the MP2 approximation predicts the N-O bond considerably too long and the dihedral angle too small.",

The rearrangement of CCCCCHO to HCCCCCO.\nThe neutrals HCCCCCO and CCCCCHO have been studied by experiment and by molecular modelling at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Neutral HCCCCCO has been made by one-electron reduction of [HCCCCCO]+ in the dual collision cell of a VG ZAB 2HF mass spectrometer. The isomer CCCCCHO is also formed in the dual collision cell, but this time by one-electron oxidation of the anion [CCCCCHO]-. Comparison of the CID and +NR+ mass spectra of [HCCCCCO]+ indicates that neutral HCCCCCO, when energised, retains its structural integrity. If the excess energy of HCCCCCO is &gt; or = 170 kJ mol-1, decomposition can occur to give HCCCC and CO (calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory). The situation with the isomer CCCCCHO is different. Comparison of the -CR+ and -NR+ spectra of [CCCCCHO]- shows that both neutral and cationic forms of CCCCCHO partially rearrange to a species which decomposes by loss of CO. The peak corresponding to loss of CO is more pronounced in the -NR+ spectrum, indicating that the rearrangement is more prevalent for the neutral than the cation. Theoretical calculations suggest that the species losing CO could be CCCCHCO or HCCCCCO, but that HCCCCCO is the more likely. The lowest-energy rearrangement pathway occurs by successive H transfers, namely CCCCCHO--&gt;CCCCHCO--&gt;CCCHCCO--&gt;HCCCCCO. The rearrangement of CCCCCHO to HCCCCCO requires CCCCCHO to have an excess energy of &gt; or = 94 kJ mol-1. The species HCCCCCO formed by this exothermic sequence (214 kJ mol-1) has a maximum excess energy of 308 kJ mol-1: this is sufficient to effect decomposition to HCCCC and CO.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

The ground state of this neutral is the singlet cumulene oxide :C=C=C=C=C=C=C=O. The adiabatic electron affinity and dipole moment of singlet C(6)CO are 2.47 eV and 4.13 D, respectively, at this level of theory. The anion (C(6)CO)-* should be a possible precursor to this neutral.

The second order transition line T(c)(H) has been determined between H(c1) = 7.52 T and H(c2) = 13.5 T and varies as (H-H(c1))(2/3) close to H(c1). From the observation of anomalous shifts and a crossover in 1/T1 above T(c), the mechanism of the 3D transition is argued to be magnetoelastic as in spin-Peierls chains, here involving a displacement of the protons along the longitudinal exchange ( J( parallel)) path.",

The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O2COH)]ZnCl(4).3H2O is isolated as a crystalline solid from an acidic solution of the parent carbonate [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4, and X-ray structural analysis shows that lengthening of the C=Oexo bond and shortening of the C-Oendo bond accompanies protonation. The bimetallic complex [Co(Me-tpa)O2COZnCl3] results from the unexpected coordination of ZnCl3- to the exo O atom of a chelated carbonate ligand.

Experimental studies with the 13C labeled analogues indicate that the loss of C occurs subsequent to or accompanying partial carbon scrambling of the CCCN backbone.

Herein, we report the synthesis of an isolable silicon analogue of a ketone that exhibits a three-coordinate silicon center and an unperturbed Si=O bond, thus representing the first example of a genuine silanone. Most importantly, this silanone does not require coordination by Lewis bases and acids and/or the introduction of electron-donating groups to stabilize the Si=O bond. The structure and properties of this unperturbed Si=O bond were examined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, NMR spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. Bimolecular reactions revealed high electrophilicity on the Si atom and high nucleophilicity on the O atom of this genuine Si=O bond.",

The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O2COH)]ZnCl(4).3H2O is isolated as a crystalline solid from an acidic solution of the parent carbonate [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4, and X-ray structural analysis shows that lengthening of the C=Oexo bond and shortening of the C-Oendo bond accompanies protonation. The bimetallic complex [Co(Me-tpa)O2COZnCl3] results from the unexpected coordination of ZnCl3- to the exo O atom of a chelated carbonate ligand. This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution. The trimetallic complex [Co(trpyn)O2COZn(OH2)4OCO2Co(trpyn)](ZnCl4)2.H2O crystallises on prolonged standing of [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4 in a neutral solution having [Zn2+]=1.0 M. The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",

Localized orbital contributions, computed by the individual gauge for localized orbitals method (IGLO), to the nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) allow pi effects to be disected from the sigma single bonds and other influences. The C-C(pi) contribution to (NICS(0,pi) (i.e., at the center of the ring) in oxocarbon dianions decreases with ring size but shows little ring size effect at points 1.0 A above the ring.

These multisubunit assemblies can act as either tumor suppressors or drivers of cancer, and inhibiting both BRG1 and BRM, is emerging as an effective therapeutic strategy in diverse cancers. BRG1 and BRM contain a BRK domain. The function of this domain is unknown, but it is often found in proteins involved in transcription and developmental signaling in higher eukaryotes, in particular in proteins that remodel chromatin. We report the NMR structure of the BRG1 BRK domain. It shows similarity to the glycine-tyrosine-phenylalanine (GYF) domain, an established protein-protein interaction module. Computational peptide-binding-site analysis of the BRK domain identifies a binding site that coincides with a highly conserved groove on the surface of the protein.

Brg1 contains a bromodomain that has been shown to anchor the entire complex to promoter nucleosomes by interacting with histones that are acetylated at specific lysine residues. The Brg1 bromodomain belongs to an important subclass of the bromodomain family for which no structural information is known. Here we report the solution structure of the Brg1 bromodomain determined by NMR. The Brg1 bromodomain conserves the left-handed, four-helix bundle topology found in other bromodomain structures. However, the alphaZ helix of Brg1 bromodomain is about 4 residues shorter relative to previously published bromodomain structures. Using NMR perturbation studies, we demonstrate the Brg1 bromodomain binds acetyllysine in the context of histone tails, with no comparable affinity for unacetylated peptides. The estimated dissociation constants (KD) for acetylated histone peptides H4-AcK8 and H4-AcK12 are 4.0 and 3.6 mM, respectively. In this study the dominant substrate was H3-AcK14 (KD approximately 1.2 mM). Mutagenesis analysis reveals several residues important for the binding specificity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we present a model of the Brg1 bromodomain in complex with H3-AcK14 and discuss the potential interactions which provide the selectivity of the Brg1 bromodomain for histone H3-AcK14.",

The domain contains two zinc atoms bound independently in CCHC (C = Cys, H = His) and CCCC modules. Both modules contain two orthogonally-arranged antiparallel beta-sheets, and the CCCC module contains an alpha-helix at its C terminus. The modules pack due to hydrophobic interactions forming a novel global fold. The structure of the C-terminal CCCC module is essentially identical to that observed for the DNA-interactive CCCC modules of the GATA-1 and steroid hormone receptor DNA binding domains, raising the possibility that the LIM motif may have a DNA binding function.",
