Possible mechanisms for such a photoreaction are explored here computationally. First, it is shown that the CO2Br radical is not stable in any geometry. This rules out a free-radical mechanism, for example, photochemical splitting of Br2 followed by stepwise addition of Br atoms to CO2-which in turn accounts for the lack of previously observed Br2+CO2 photochemistry in gas phases. A possible alternative mechanism in liquid phase is formation of a weakly bound CO2:Br2 complex, followed by concerted photoaddition of Br2. This hypothesis is suggested by the previously published spectroscopic detection of a binary CO2:Br2 complex in the supersonically cooled gas phase. We compute a global binding-energy minimum of -6.2 kJ mol(-1) for such complexes, in a linear geometry. Two additional local minima were computed for perpendicular (C2v) and nearly parallel asymmetric planar geometries, both with binding energies near -5.4 kJ mol(-1). In these two latter geometries, C-Br and O-Br bond distances are simultaneously in the range of 3.5-3.8 Å, that is, perhaps suitable for a concerted photoaddition under the temperature and pressure conditions where Br2 + CO2 photochemistry has been observed.

This motivates us to theoretically reexamine the title reaction thoroughly, which has been studied only at several low levels of theory. In the present work, the geometry optimizations and energy calculations for all species involved in the title reaction were performed at several high levels of theory. The reaction mechanism of the title reaction is discussed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//CCSD/6-31G(d,p) theoretical level. According to our study, the fluorine addition to ethylene occurs via the formation of a prereaction complex with C2v symmetry, which is pointed out for the first time. The prereaction complex evolves into a fluoroethyl radical almost without a barrier, with an exothermicity of 41.49 kcal/mol. The fluoroethyl radical can further decompose into a hydrogen atom and fluoroethylene, with an energy release of 10.33 kcal/mol. Besides the direct departure of the hydrogen atom from the fluoroethyl radical, an indirect decomposition pathway may also be open, which has not been reported before. In addition, the formation of a fluoroethyl radical from a separate fluorine atom and ethylene is described pictorially via the molecular intrinsic characteristic contour (MICC) and the electron density mapped on it. Thereby, strong interpolarization and evident electron transfer between the fluorine atom and ethylene are observed as they approach each other. The transition structure for the fluorine addition to ethylene is clearly shown to be reactant-like. This provides new and intuitional insight into the title reaction.",

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C.

The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C.

Our finding suggests that, in the presence of ammonia and ammonia dimer the title reaction becomes a barrierless reaction with respect to the isolated reactants (energy barrier = ∼-0.53 and ∼-0.27 kcal mol-1, respectively), whereas in the presence of formic acid and ammonia-water complex the energy barrier of the CI + CO reaction becomes ∼2.84 and ∼0.82 kcal mol-1, respectively. However, among all the catalysts, due to the very low concentration of the ammonia dimer, its contribution towards the title reaction is insignificant as compared to that of the other catalysts.

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4. In this case, computational results support electrochemical data in backing a direct electron transfer reaction.",

For both the biotransformations and models, an initial hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate (R-H) by high-valent iron-oxo species (Fe<supn</sup=O) generates a substrate radical and a reduced iron hydroxide, [Fe<supn-1</sup-OH ·R]. This caged radical pair then evolves on a complicated energy landscape through a number of reaction pathways, such as oxygen rebound to form R-OH, rebound to a non-oxygen atom affording R-X, electron transfer of the incipient radical to yield a carbocation, R<sup+</sup, desaturation to form olefins, and radical cage escape. These various flavors of the rebound process, often in competition with each other, give rise to the wide range of C-H functionalization reactions performed by iron-containing oxygenases. In this review, we first recount the history of radical rebound mechanisms, their general features, and key intermediates involved. We will discuss in detail the factors that affect the behavior of the initial caged radical pair and the lifetimes of the incipient substrate radicals. Several representative examples of enzymatic C-H transformations are selected to illustrate how the behaviors of the radical pair [Fe<supn-1</sup-OH ·R] determine the eventual reaction outcome. Finally, we discuss the powerful potential of \"radical rebound\" processes as a general paradigm for developing novel C-H functionalization reactions with synthetic, biomimetic catalysts. We envision that new chemistry will continue to arise by bridging enzymatic \"radical rebound\" with synthetic organic chemistry.",

Br2 (12), 3 . Br2 (13) and 4 . Br2 (14). A conductometric and spectrophotometric investigation into the reaction between 1-4 and Br2, carried out in MeCN, allows the equilibria involved in the formation of the isolated 10-E-3 (E = S, Se) hypervalent compounds to be hypothesised. In order to understand the reasons why S and Se donors can give different product types on treatment with Br2 and I2, DFT calculations have been carried out on 1-8, 19 and 20, and on their corresponding hypothetical [LEX]+ cations (L = organic framework; E = S, Se; X = Br, I), which are considered to be key intermediates in the formation of the different products. The results obtained in terms of NBO charge distribution on [LEX]+ species explain the different behaviour of 1-8, 19 and 20 in their reactions with Br2 and I2 fairly well. X-ray diffraction studies show 12-14 to have a T-shaped (10-E-3; E = S, Se) hypervalent chalcogen nature. They contain an almost linear Br-E-Br (E = S, Se) system roughly perpendicular to the average plane of the organic molecules. In 12, the Se atom of each adduct molecule has a short interaction with the Br(1) atom of an adjacent unit, such that the Se atom displays a roughly square planar coordination. The Se-Br distances are asymmetric [2.529(1) vs. 2.608(1) A], the shorter distance being that with the Br(1) atom involved in the short intermolecular contact. In contrast, in the molecular adducts 13 and 14, which lie on a two-fold crystallographic axis, the Br-E-Br system is symmetric and no short intermolecular interactions involving chalcogen and bromine atoms are observed. The adducts are arranged in parallel planes; this gives rise to a graphite-like stacking. The new crystalline modification of 10, obtained from acetonitrile solution, confirms the importance of short intermolecular contacts in determining the asymmetry of Br-E-Br (E = S, Se) and I-Se-I groups in hypervalent 10-E-3 compounds. The analogies in the conductometric and spectrophotometric titrations of 1 and 2-4 with Br2, together with the similarity of the vibrational spectra of 11-14, also imply a T-shaped nature for 11. The vibrational properties of the Br-E-Br (E = S, Se) systems resemble those of the Br3- and IBr2- anions: the Raman spectrum of a symmetric Br-E-Br group shows only one peak near 160 cm(-1), as found for symmetric Br3- and IBr2- anions, while asymmetric Br-E-Br groups also show an antisymmetric Br-E-Br mode at around 190 cm(-1), as observed for asymmetric Br3- and IBr2- ions. Therefore, simple IR and Raman measurements provide a useful tool for distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric Br-E-Br groups, and hence allow predictions about the crystal packing of these hypervalent chalcogen compounds to be made when crystals of good quality are not available.",

All methods confirm that the cyclization barrier is highly sensitive to the nature of the ortho substituents. However, the measured activation energies strongly depend on the choice of experimental technique: even the relative trends provided by the different methods agree with each other only in the case of acceptor substituents. Both the onset peaks and the activation energies determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; either in neat enediynes or in their solutions in 10.6 M 1,4-cyclohexadiene (1,4-CHD)) strongly overestimate the reactivity of 1,2-diethynylbenzene, suggesting that DSC cannot be taken as a reliable indicator of enediyne reactivity. This discrepancy is likely to stem from the presence of side reactions with low activation barriers, especially important when the reaction is conducted in neat enediyne. On the other hand, kinetic measurements based on monitoring the concentrations of enediyne reactants and naphthalene products provide reliable general trends that include the parent benzannelated enediyne. These measurements confirm that both ortho-NO2 and ortho-CHO substituents substantially decrease activation energies for the Bergman cyclization, supporting earlier computational predictions. A comparison of theory and experiment suggests that computations at the Moeller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2)/6-31G level provide an excellent alternative to DFT when an accurate description of the contribution of noncovalent interactions to the activation energy is needed. Activation energies derived from k(eff), the effective rate constant under the pseudo-first-order approximation, depend on the 1,4-CHD concentrations. The true rate constant, k(1), for the cyclization step and the ratio of constants for the retro-Bergman ring opening, k(-1), and the intermolecular H-atom abstraction, k2, were determined from the dependence of cycloaromatization kinetics of ortho- and para-NO2 substituted enediynes on the concentration of 1,4-CHD.",

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

The optimized geometries and frequencies of the stationary points and the minimum energy path are calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level, and the energetic information is further refined by the MC-QCISD method. There are two hydrogen abstraction channels for reaction R1 and three hydrogen abstraction channels for reaction R2. And four products, CF2CHFOCF3, CHF2CFOCF3, CF2CH2OCF3, and CHF2CHOCF3, are produced during these two reactions. The enthalpies of formation for the species involved in the two reactions (CHF2CHFOCF3, CF2CHFOCF3, CHF2CFOCF3, CHF2CH2OCF3, CF2CH2OCF3, and CHF2CHOCF3) are calculated via isodesmic reaction. Furthermore, the reaction mechanisms of subsequent reactions of product radicals (CF2CHFOCF3, CHF2CFOCF3, CF2CH2OCF3, and CHF2CHOCF3) with the OH radical are studied at the same level. The rate constants of reactions R1 and R2 are evaluated by means of canonical variational transition-state theory including the small-curvature tunneling correction over a wide range of temperatures, from 250 to 1200 K. Our results show that the tunneling correction plays an important role in the rate constant calculation in the low-temperature range. Agreement between the calculated and experimental data available at 298 K is good. It is found that the fluorine substitution decreases the reactivity of the C-H bond, and as a result, reaction R2 may proceed much easier than reaction R1. The Arrhenius expressions over a wide temperature range are obtained, and the kinetic isotope effects for reactions CHF2CHFOCF3/CDF2CDFOCF3 + OH and CHF2CH2OCF3/CDF2CD2OCF3 + OH are estimated so as to provide theoretical estimation for future laboratory investigation.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Kappa(R) is negative throughout such a region. We summarize evidence supporting the idea that a reaction should be viewed as going through a transition region rather than through a single point transition state. A similar conclusion has come out of transition state spectroscopy.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous.

Both kinetic and thermodynamic control of the reaction cascade are important, depending upon the conditions. Kinetic control was analyzed by the distortion/interaction model and found to be dictated by differences in distortions of the cycloaddends in the transition states.

How realistic are such mechanistic assumptions? In the last few years a number of key compound classes have been discovered that can provide some answers.

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

The process is composed of two separate reactions, the first of which is a partial reduction of the nitro groups of the 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl, a process that we believe proceeds via a SET mechanism to yield the hydroxyamino and nitroso groups. In the following step the cyclization takes place under formation of the -N=N- bond. We believe that this process take place via a radical mechanism through the nitroso radical anion. The novel process affords either benzo[c]cinnoline or benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide, both in high yields, 93% and 91%, respectively. To obtain benzo[c]cinnoline, the reaction is conducted with an alcohol as solvent and an alkoxide as the base, while for benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide, water is used as solvent with sodium hydroxide as the base. To establish the latter procedure, statistical experimental design and multivariate modeling were utilized to reveal the response surface for the reaction and to determine the optimal conditions for the reaction. A proposal for the complex reaction mechanism is given. During the corroboration of the mechanism, a new deoxygenation reaction for converting benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide into benzo[c]cinnoline was discovered. The reaction is conducted by treating the N-oxide with sodium ethoxide at elevated temperature to achieve near-quantitative conversion into benzo[c]cinnoline in a yield of 96%.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

The prominence of the P-S cyclization is brought about by the inheritance from analogous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the biogenetic pathways of natural products, mainly indole alkaloids, with a broad range of biological activities. This knowledge has been the starting point for the biomimetic synthesis or the bio-engineering production of pharmacologically important drugs. The long-lasting life of the P-S reaction depends on the discovery of its multiple facets, the modifications of its parameters and components, as well as the continuous renovation of solutions for the challenging stereochemical outcome of the transformation. This paper deals with an updated visit to the P-S reaction aiming to find the threads of the story without forgetting the numerous facets of the prism. It is organized as a theater piece, with a prologue and the main scene (namely, Act 1) where the readers can follow the parade of the two above-mentioned very recurring motifs (namely, THIQ and THBC) by moving from one step to another (a cyclization, an intramolecular attack, a stereoselective passage) to find the way out of the labyrinth of the P-S reaction.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The structures of reactants, intermediates, products, and transition states were optimized at the MPW1PW91/6-311+G(3df,2p) level of theory, and the potential energy surface of each reaction was refined at the G2M and CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,2p) levels of theory.

In the HOCl + ClO(3) reaction both processes can occur; the barriers of Cl and H abstraction are 16.4 and 17.1 kcal/mol, respectively. In the HOCl + ClO(4) reaction, the H abstraction transition state lies below that of the reactants by 1.4 kcal/mol. The rate constants for all low barrier channels have been calculated in the temperature range 200-3000 K by statistical theory.

Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center.

When I think of Tetsuo Nozoe, these are the images that immediately come to mind. When I think of the Nozoe Autograph Books, I also think of time. For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

Despite the charge difference, the barrier heights and the geometrical requirements upon going from the reactant to the transition structure are surprisingly similar for X- and XH. The barrier heights decrease on going from left to right in the periodic table, and increasing ionization energy (of X- and XH) is correlated with decreasing barrier. The observed trends are explained in terms of substrates with stronger electrostatic character giving rise to lower energetic barriers due to decreased electron repulsion in the transition structure. On the basis of this study, the relationship between the kinetic concept of nucleophilicity and the thermodynamic concept of basicity has been analyzed and clarified. Since the trends in intrinsic nucleophilicity (only defined for identity reactions) and basicity are opposite, overall nucleophilicity (defined for any reaction) will be determined by the relative contribution of the two factors. Only for strongly exothermic reactions will basicity and nucleophilicity be matching.",

It is found that replacement of acetate by acetamidate used as a ligand and a base significantly lowers the barrier to the formation of the key agostic intermediate. The latter shows a peculiar polarization by its immediate ligand environment where a significant electrostatic CHO interaction with the neighboring carboxylato ligand competes with the strong propensity of the latter to bind the metal center, which is stronger in the agostic intermediate when the carboxylato ligand is the acetate and when the metal is Ni. It is also shown that the hereby idealized cyclonickelation is disfavored as compared to cyclopalladation owing to enhanced electrostatic repulsion in almost all stages of the CMD mechanism.",

With the two functionals and the triple-ζ basis set, the zwitterion is 1.70 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the reactants, and close to 1.63 kcal mol(-1) computed using the CCSD(T) approach. The inclusion of vibrational and thermal corrections and of entropic effects increases the relative energy of the zwitterion to 14.7 kcal mol(-1). Bending of the CO2 geometry increases its acidity due to a 1.09 eV reduction in the LUMO energy. Calculation of the CO2 interaction energy with a set of amines revealed that the interaction energies show a high correlation with their basicities, with the stronger bases stabilizing the zwitterion. For the most basic amine computed (3,4,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine), the Gibbs free energy of the zwitterion is 15.8 kcal mol(-1) lower than the reactants.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The heats of formation (ΔHf,298) based on our best estimated atomization energies are 198.3 ± 5 kJ mol(-1) (CrO), -81.3 ± 5 kJ mol(-1) (CrO2), and -286.8 ± 20 kJ mol(-1) (CrO3). Standard G4-type composite methods yield atomization energies that are adequate for CrO, less good for CrO2, and least good for CrO3. CrO3 is highly multireference in character, and therefore, a \"black box\" approach of using a single-reference RHF wave function is inadequate, even for \"high-level\" G4-type methods. We find that, for CrO3, there is a very large difference in the G4 atomization energies depending on whether an RHF or a UHF reference is used, which is mainly associated with large differences in the MP4 components. In general, we propose that a large R-versus-U difference is likely to be an indication of potential problems in the theoretical treatment. Going beyond G4 to a more rigorous UCCSD(T)-based composite scheme [termed U-CM(3:[DZ,TZ]) in the present study], we again find a large difference (but significantly smaller than that for G4) between the CrO3 atomization energies based on RHF or UHF references. Intriguingly, the use of Brueckner orbitals as reference orbitals in all components, as in the corresponding Brueckner Doubles (BD) procedure [B-CM(3:[DZ,TZ])], produces results for CrO3 that are independent of whether RHF or UHF orbitals are used as the starting point.

Possible mechanisms were classified according to four pathways yielding products in the following four possible groups: N2O/N2S + CN, N2 + NCO/NCS, N2 + CNO/CNS, and CNN + NO/NS, labeled in order from p1/p1s to p4/p4s. The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive. The channel leading to p1 (N2O + CN) has the lowest energy (3.81 kcal/mol), whereas the channels leading to p2 (N2 + NCO) and p2s (N2 + NCS) are the most exothermic (100.94 and 107.38 kcal/mol, respectively).",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Where the reaction produces a carbanion and CO2, we would expect that the high energy of the carbanion causes the transition state for C-C bond cleavage also to be high in energy. Since the energy of the carbanion is a thermodynamic property, an enzyme obviously cannot change that property. Yet, enzymes overcome the barrier to forming the carbanion. In thinking about decarboxylation, we had assumed that CO2 is well behaved and forms without its own barriers. However, we analyzed reactions in solution of compounds that resemble intermediates in enzymic reaction and found some of them to be subject to unexpected forms of catalysis. Those results caused us to discard the usual assumptions about CO2 and carbanions. We learned that CO2 can be a very reactive electrophile. In decarboxylation reactions, where CO2 forms in the same step as a carbanion, separation of the products might be the main problem preventing the forward reaction because the carbanion can add readily to CO2 in competition with their separation and solvation. The basicity of the carbanion also might be overestimated because when we see that the decarboxylation is slow, we assume that it is because the carbanion is high in energy. We found reactions where the carbanion is protonated internally; CO2 appears to be able to depart without reversion more rapidly. We tested these ideas using kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions, carbon kinetic isotope effects, and synthesis of predecarboxylation intermediates. In another case, we observed that the decarboxylation is subject to general base catalysis while producing a significant carbon kinetic isotope effect. This requires both a proton transfer from an intermediate and C-C bond-breaking in the rate-determining step. This would occur if the route involves the surprising initial addition of water to the carboxyl, with the cleavage step producing bicarbonate. Interestingly, some enzyme-catalyzed reactions also appear to produce intermediates formed by the initial addition of water or a nucleophile to the carboxyl or to nascent CO2. We conclude that decarboxylation is not necessarily a problem that results from the energy of the carbanionic products alone but from their formation in the presence of CO2. Catalysts that facilitate the separation of the species on either side of the C-C bond that cleaves could solve the problem using catalytic principles that we find in many enzymes that promote hydrolytic processes, suggesting linkages in catalysis through evolution of activity.

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

When I think of Tetsuo Nozoe, these are the images that immediately come to mind. When I think of the Nozoe Autograph Books, I also think of time. For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books. Tetsuo Nozoe would have beamed!--Jeffrey I. Seeman Guest Editor University of Richmond Richmond, Virginia 23173, USA E-mail: jseeman@richmond.edu.",

                    "contents": "Reaction rate theory: what it was, where is it today, and where is it going?\nA brief history is presented, outlining the development of rate theory during the past century. Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, considered by many to be the father of TST, never resolved the question as to the definition of the activation energy for which Arrhenius became famous. In 1978, Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 2959 (1978)] finally showed that especially when considering condensed phases, the activation energy is a free energy, it is the barrier height in the potential of mean force felt by the reacting system. Parallel to the development of rate theory in the chemistry community, Kramers published in 1940 [Physica (Amsterdam) 7, 284 (1940)] a seminal paper on the relation between Einstein's theory of Brownian motion [Einstein, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)] and rate theory. Kramers' paper provided a solution for the effect of friction on reaction rates but left us also with some challenges. He could not derive a uniform expression for the rate, valid for all values of the friction coefficient, known as the Kramers turnover problem. He also did not establish the connection between his approach and the TST developed by the chemistry community. For many years, Kramers' theory was considered as providing a dynamic correction to the thermodynamic TST. Both of these questions were resolved in the 1980s when Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 85, 865 (1986)] showed that Kramers' expression in the moderate to strong friction regime could be derived from TST, provided that the bath, which is the source of the friction, is handled at the same level as the system which is observed. This then led to the Mel'nikov-Pollak-Grabert-Hanggi [Mel'nikov and Meshkov, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1018 (1986); Pollak, Grabert, and Hanggi, ibid. 91, 4073 (1989)] solution of the turnover problem posed by Kramers. Although classical rate theory reached a high level of maturity, its quantum analog leaves the theorist with serious challenges to this very day. As noted by Wigner [Trans. Faraday Soc. 34, 29 (1938)], TST is an inherently classical theory. A definite quantum TST has not been formulated to date although some very useful approximate quantum rate theories have been invented. The successes and challenges facing quantum rate theory are outlined. An open problem which is being investigated intensively is rate theory away from equilibrium. TST is no longer valid and cannot even serve as a conceptual guide for understanding the critical factors which determine rates away from equilibrium. The nonequilibrium quantum theory is even less well developed than the classical, and suffers from the fact that even today, we do not know how to solve the real time quantum dynamics for systems with \"many\" degrees of freedom.",

Various formulations of electronegativity have been proposed on this basis, and predictions made using different formulations generally agree reasonably well with each other and with chemical experience. A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

Recently, CCP4 introduced CCP4i2, a modern graphical interface designed to help structural biologists to navigate the process of structure determination, with an emphasis on pipelining and the streamlined presentation of results. In addition, CCP4i2 provides a framework for writing structure-solution scripts that can be built up incrementally to create increasingly automatic procedures.",

It is impossible to solve for a or b the equation axb=c, where a and b are three-dimensional space vectors, and axb is their cross product. However, the problem becomes solvable if some \"knowledge about the unknown\" (a or b) is available, consisting of one of its components, or the angle it forms with the other operand of the cross product. Independently of the selected reference frame orientation, the known component of a may be parallel to b, or vice versa. The cross divisions provide a compact and insightful symbolic representation of a family of algorithms specifically designed to solve problems of such kind. A generalized algorithm was also defined, incorporating the rules for selecting the appropriate kind of cross division, based on the type of input data. Four examples of practical application were provided, including the computation of the point of application of a force and the angular velocity of a rigid body. The definition and geometrical interpretation of the cross divisions stemmed from the concept of anticrossproduct. The \"anticrossproducts of axb\" were defined as the infinitely many vectors x(i) such that x(i)xb=axb.",

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

A new field of science suggested by Liberman and named Chaimatics combines biology, physics and mathematics. The main idea of Chaimatics is simple: not only measurement, but also calculation is a real physical operation and cannot be done for free-energy and time must be spent on calculation. Quantum physics arose on the basis of discovering the existence of the minimum action-Planck's constant. And this factor imposes physical limits on computation and sets the boundaries to the physical world and its observation.

Complexes 1-3 are isolable as air-stable, analytically pure yellow solids in good to moderate yields by chromatography or fractional crystallization. In solutions, complex 1 exists as two coordination isomers in an 83:17 ratio differing with respect to the endo/exo orientation of the allyl ligand. In contrast, complexes 2 and 3 each exist as four coordination isomers, all differing by the orientation of their allyl ligands which can have either an endo or an exo orientation with the phenyl or methyl groups being either proximal or distal to the nitrosyl ligand. A DFT computational analysis using the major isomer of Cp*W(NO)(H)(η(3)-CH2CHCHMe) (3a) as the model complex has revealed that its lowest-energy thermal-decomposition pathway involves the intramolecular isomerization of 3a to the 16e η(2)-alkene complex, Cp*W(NO)(η(2)-CH2═CHCH2Me). Such η(2)-alkene complexes are isolable as their 18e PMe3 adducts when compounds 1-3 are thermolyzed in neat PMe3, the other organometallic products formed during these thermolyses being Cp*W(NO)(PMe3)2 (5) and, occasionally, Cp*W(NO)(H)(η(1)-allyl)(PMe3). All new complexes have been characterized by conventional spectroscopic and analytical methods, and the solid-state molecular structures of most of them have been established by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses.

However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades.

Purification of 1a and 1b is achieved by sublimation of the excess Hhpp and subsequent recrystallization from either CH(2)Cl(2) or CHCl(3) (or CDCl(3)). By single-crystal X-ray crystallography, the structures of 1a and 1b are shown to contain a central paddlewheel-like M(2)(hpp)(4) core with Mo-Mo = 2.1708(8) A (from CH(2)Cl(2)), 2.1574(5) A (from CDCl(3)), W-W = 2.2328(2) A (from CDCl(3)), and M-N = 2.09(1) (av) A. The Cl ligands are axially ligated (linear Cl-M-M-Cl) with abnormally long M-Cl bond distances that, in turn, depend on the presence or absence of hydrogen bonding to chloroform. The quadruply bonded compounds M(2)(hpp)(4), 2a (M = Mo), and 2b (M = W), can be prepared from the reactions between 1,2-M(2)R(2)(NMe(2))(4) compounds, where R = (i)()Bu or p-tolyl, and Hhpp (4 equiv) in benzene by ligand replacement and reductive elimination. The compounds 2a and 2b are readily oxidized, and in chloroform they react to form 1a and 1b, respectively. The electronic structure and bonding in the compounds 1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b have been investigated using gradient corrected density functional theory employing Gaussian 98. The bonding in the M-M quadruply bonded compounds, 2a and 2b, reveals M-M delta(2) HOMOs and extensive mixing of M-M pi and nitrogen ligand lone-pair orbitals in a manner qualitatively similar to that of the M(2)(formamidinates)(4). The calculations indicate that in the chloride compounds, 1a and 1b, the HOMO is strongly M-Cl sigma antibonding and weakly M-M sigma bonding in character. Formally there is a M-M triple bond of configuration pi(4)sigma(2), and the LUMO is the M-M delta orbital. An interesting mixing of M-M and M-Cl pi interactions occurs, and an enlightening analogy emerges between these d(4)-d(4) and d(3)-d(3) dinuclear compounds and the bonding in C(2), C(2)H(2), and C(2)Cl(2), which is interrogated herein by simple theoretical calculations together with the potential bonding in axially ligated compounds where strongly covalent M-X bonds are present.

The prominence of the P-S cyclization is brought about by the inheritance from analogous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the biogenetic pathways of natural products, mainly indole alkaloids, with a broad range of biological activities. This knowledge has been the starting point for the biomimetic synthesis or the bio-engineering production of pharmacologically important drugs. The long-lasting life of the P-S reaction depends on the discovery of its multiple facets, the modifications of its parameters and components, as well as the continuous renovation of solutions for the challenging stereochemical outcome of the transformation. This paper deals with an updated visit to the P-S reaction aiming to find the threads of the story without forgetting the numerous facets of the prism. It is organized as a theater piece, with a prologue and the main scene (namely, Act 1) where the readers can follow the parade of the two above-mentioned very recurring motifs (namely, THIQ and THBC) by moving from one step to another (a cyclization, an intramolecular attack, a stereoselective passage) to find the way out of the labyrinth of the P-S reaction.

For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4. In this case, computational results support electrochemical data in backing a direct electron transfer reaction.",

The relationship between these reactions and catalytic C-O coupling methods is demonstrated by the reaction of the macrocyclic aryl–Br species with acetic acid and p-fluorophenol in the presence of 10 mol% Cu(I). An aryl-Cu(III)-Br species 2(Br) was observed as an intermediate in the catalytic reaction. Investigation of the stoichiometric C-O bond-forming reactions revealed nucleophile-dependent changes in the mechanism.

The latter trend resembles previous observations with nitrogen nucleophiles.

Under an Ar or N2 atmosphere the reaction is stoichiometric and produces the Cr[triple bond]Cr triply bonded complex [Cr(CO)2(C5R5)]2. Under a CO atmosphere regeneration of [Cr(CO)3(C5R5)]2 (R = H, CH3) occurs competitively and conversion of diazo to ketene occurs catalytically as well as stoichiometrically. Two key intermediates in the reaction, .Cr(CO)2(ketene)(C5R5) and Cr2(CO)5(C5R5)2 have been detected spectroscopically. The complex .Cr(13CO)2(O=13C=CHSiMe3)(C5Me5) has been studied by electron spin resonance spectroscopy in toluene solution: g(iso) = 2.007; A(53Cr) = 125 MHz; A(13CO) = 22.5 MHz; A(O=13C=CHSiMe3) = 12.0 MHz. The complex Cr2(CO)5(C5H5)2, generated in situ, does not show a signal in its 1H NMR and reacts relatively slowly with CO. It is proposed to be a ground-state triplet in keeping with predictions based on high level density functional theory (DFT) studies. Computed vibrational frequencies are also in good agreement with experimental data. The rates of CO loss from 3Cr2(CO)5(C5H5)2 producing 1[Cr(CO)2(C5H5)]2 and CO addition to 3Cr2(CO)5(C5H5)2 producing 1[Cr(CO)3(C5H5)]2 have been measured by kinetics and show DeltaH approximately equal 23 kcal mol(-1) for both processes. Enthalpies of reduction by Na/Hg under CO atmosphere of [Cr(CO)n(C5H5)]2 (n = 2,3) have been measured by solution calorimetry and provide data for estimation of the Cr[triple bond]Cr bond strength in [Cr(CO)2(C5H5)]2 as 72 kcal mol(-1). The complex [Cr(CO)2(C5H5)]2 does not readily undergo 13CO exchange at room temperature or 50 degrees C implying that 3Cr2(CO)5(C5H5)2 is not readily accessed from the thermodynamically stable complex [Cr(CO)2(C5H5)]2. A detailed mechanism for metalloradical based conversion of diazo and CO to ketene and N2 is proposed on the basis of a combination of experimental and theoretical data.",

It was shown that the gas-phase reaction of W with CO2 proceeds with a negligible barrier via an insertion pathway, W(7S)+CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta2-OCO)(6A')--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)(1A)--&gt;WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma). This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center.

Similar correlations are also found with the electronegativity of central atoms in X, deformation energy of the E2 transition state (TS), and the overall enthalpy of reaction. It is revealed that the electronegativity will significantly affect the barrier height, and a more electronegative X will stabilize the E2 and SN2 transition states.

Corresponding studies with DMo(CO)3(Cp) (1-D) showed a normal kinetic isotope effect with kH/kD approximately 1.6, DeltaH(double dagger) = 13.1 +/- 0.4 kcal mol(-1) and DeltaS(double dagger) = 1.1 +/- 1.6 cal K(-1) mol(-1). Spectroscopic studies of the much slower reaction of 1-H and 2 yielding 2-H and 1/2 1(2) showed generation of variable amounts of a complex proposed to be (Ar[t-Bu]N)3Mo-Mo(CO)3(Cp) (1-2). Complex 1-2 can also be formed in small equilibrium amounts by direct reaction of excess 2 and 1(2). The presence of 1-2 complicates the kinetic picture; however, in the presence of excess 2, the second-order rate constant for H atom transfer from 1-H has been measured: 0.09 +/- 0.01 M(-1) s(-1) at 1.3 degrees C and 0.26 +/- 0.04 M(-1) s(-1) at 17 degrees C. Study of the rate of reaction of 1-D yielded kH/kD = 1.00 +/- 0.05 consistent with an early transition state in which formation of the adduct (Ar[t-Bu]N)3Mo...HMo(CO)3(Cp) is rate limiting.",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

In this paper, possible mechanisms including single electron transfer (SET) and the concerted metalation-deprotonation (CMD) pathways of the Co<supII</sup/Co<supIII</sup-catalyzed alkoxylation of C(sp<sup2</sup)-H bonds have been investigated for the first time using the DFT method. Co<supII</sup(OAc)<sub2</sub has been employed as an efficient catalyst in our previous experimental study, but the calculated results unexpectedly indicated that the intermolecular SET pathway with Co<supIII</sup as the actual catalyst might be the most favorable pathway. To support this theoretical prediction, we have explored a series of Cp*Co<supIII</sup(CO)I<sub2</sub catalyzed C(sp<sup2</sup)-H bond alkoxylations, extending the application of cobalt-catalyzed functionalization of C-H bonds. Furthermore, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) data, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data, and TEMPO inhibition experiments also support the SET mechanism in both the Co-catalyzed alkoxylation reactions. Thus, this work should support an understanding of the possible mechanisms of the Co<supII</sup/Co<supIII</sup-catalyzed C(sp<sup2</sup)-H functionalization, and also provide an example of the rational design of novel catalytic reactions guided by theoretical calculations.",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

Ionic bonds, covalent bonds, aromatics, and electron-deficiency compounds can formally be described without loss of information. Even reaction types and the flow of electrons can be described by this algebra. The biggest benefit of this approach is its intrinsic group theoretical structure. This does not bother the chemist for its use but allows a computer to handle and structure huge amounts of chemical data. This is especially important for combinatorial chemistry, which deals with huge sets of chemically distinct molecules, the so-called molecular libraries.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

The geometric parameters of the reactants, products, and transition states are optimized by both UMPW1PW91 and unrestricted coupled-cluster single and double excitation (UCCSD) methods with the 6-311+G(3df) basis set. The potential energy surface has been further refined (with triple excitations, T) at the UCCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) level of theory. The results show that Cl(2) and O ((3)P) can be produced by chlorine atom abstraction via a tight transition state, while ClOCl ((1)A(1)) and ClClO ((1)A') can be formed by barrierless association processes with exothermicities of 31.8 and 16.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In principle the O ((1)D) atom can be generated with a large endothermicity of 56.9 kcal/mol; on the other hand, its barrierless reaction with Cl(2) can readily form ClClO ((1)A'), which fragments rapidly to give ClO + Cl. The rate constants of both forward and reverse processes have been predicted at 150-2000 K by the microcanonical variational transition state theory (VTST)/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

This maintenance of a dynamic state focuses on conditions where the objects are thermodynamically not very stable and should be rare or virtually inexistent. It does not matter whether they are homochirally enriched populations of chiral molecules, a specific composition of some sort of aggregate, supramolecules, or even a set of chemically relatively unstable molecules that constantly transform one into another. What does matter is that these specific interactions prevail in complex mixtures and eventually grow in numbers and frequency through the enhancing action of autocatalysis, which makes such systems ultimately resemble living cells and interacting living populations. Such chemical systems need to be correctly understood, but also intuitively described. They may be so complex that metaphors become practically more important, as a means of communication, than the precise and correct technical description of chemical models and complex molecular or supramolecular relations. This puts systems chemists on a tightrope walk of science communication, between the complex reality and an imaginative model world. This essay addresses, both, scientists who would like to read \"A Brief History of Systems Chemistry\", that is, about its \"essence\", and systems chemists who work with and communicate complex life-like chemical systems. I illustrate for the external reader a light mantra, that I call \"to make more of it\", and I charily draw systems chemists to reflect upon the fact that chemists are not always good at drawing a clear line between a model and \"the reality\": The real thing.

Various formulations of electronegativity have been proposed on this basis, and predictions made using different formulations generally agree reasonably well with each other and with chemical experience. A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

A proposal has been published recently to establish a new definition for the mole based on a fixed value for the Avogadro constant. This would introduce consistent relative uncertainties for the molar and the atomic masses while making no change to the system of relative atomic masses ('atomic weights'). Although the proposal would have little impact on the measurement uncertainty of practical work, it has stimulated considerable debate about the mole and the nature of the quantity amount of substance. In this paper, the rationale for the new definition is explained against the background of changes in the way the quantity amount of substance has been used, from its first use during the early development of thermodynamics through to the use of the 'number of gram-molecules' at the end of the nineteenth century.",

The current definition of the mole shows a certain ambiguity regarding the nature of the quantity \"amount of substance\". The proposed new definition removes the ambiguity, but at a cost: it becomes difficult to justify treating amount of substance as having its own dimension, and hence its own unit, the mole. I argue that the difficulties with amount of substance result from its role as a mediator between macroscopic and microscopic scales. To understand why amount of substance might have its own dimension, we need to connect amount of substance to mass, contra current proposals to separate them.",

Around 1700, Stahl coins the word \"organism\" for a certain concept of order. For him, the concept explains the form of order of living bodies that is categorically different from the order of other (dead) bodies or composites. At the end of the century, the \"organism\" as a specific form of order becomes a major topos in many discourses. I will not so much focus on experiments and objects as on basic problems that contribute to the general framework of the concept of organism as a key concept of the vitalist movement between 1700 and 1800. For this purpose, I will investigate the combination of three explanatory tools. These tools refer to regulating agents, functional interactions, and stimulus-reactions-schemes within individual organic systems of forces. They are related to various themes--especially to energy, sensibility, and sympathy. I will retrace some aspects of these relations.",

One chemical system has been established that spontaneously develops autocatalytic feedback, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. In this essay, I discuss the BZ reaction as a possible model for similar reactions that could have occurred under prebiotic Earth conditions. The main point is that the metabolism of contemporary life evolved from primitive homeostatic networks regulated by negative feedback.

Here, we show using statistical mechanics that this principle is equivalent to a force law ⟨ ⟨ f ⟩ ⟩ &gt; 0 in systems where mass centers and forces can be identified. The sign of this net force--the average mean force along a path from A to B--determines the direction of the process.

We apply instead a framework called Chemical Organization Theory (COT), which shows mathematically under which conditions reaction networks are able to form self-maintaining, autopoietic organizations. We introduce the concepts of perturbation, action, and goal based on an operationalization of the notion of change developed within COT. Next, we incorporate the latter with notions native to the theory of cybernetics aimed to explain goal directedness: reference levels and negative feedback among others. To test and refine these theoretical results, we present some examples that illustrate our approach. We finally discuss how this could result in a realistic, step-by-step scenario for the evolution of goal directedness, thus providing a theoretical solution to the age-old question of the origins of purpose.",

In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory. The electron density distribution in a molecule can now be analyzed using the ELF and other functions of the electron density to show where electron pairs are most probably to be found in a molecule.",

This work presents the use of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem in conjunction with the partitioning of the molecular space into atoms in the spirit of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). Homopolar and heteropolar diatomic molecules of varying polarity are studied in the context of Feynman force components, i.e. the components exerted on each nucleus by the other nucleus and by the electron density distributions of each of the atoms.

The issue of polarization vs. charge transfer is an example; energy decomposition analysis is another.

The \"coarctate rules\" are derived from a topological variant of the aromaticity of the transition state principle. Pseudocoarctate transition states exhibit disconnections in the topology of orbital overlap and do not necessarily follow the coarctate rules.",

The range of reliability of these methods is assessed by calculations of a variety of systems, which include an H-bond, halogen bond, π-tetrel bond, CH··HC interaction, and a pairing of two anions. While the results appear to be meaningful for the equilibrium geometries, and those where the two subunits are progressively pulled apart, these techniques erroneously predict a progressively stronger bonding interaction as the two units are compressed and the interaction becomes clearly repulsive.

The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

As such, we focus herein on the main point of contention, the 4th bond of C2, and discuss the main views. We present new data and an overview of the nature of the 4th bond--its proposed antiferromagnetically coupled nature, its strength, and a derivation of its bond energy from experimentally based thermochemical data. We address the bond-order conundrum of C2 arising from generalized VB (GVB) calculations by comparing it to HC≡CH, and showing that the two molecules behave very similarly, and C2 is in no way an exception. We analyse the root cause of the deviation of C2 from the Badger Rule, and demonstrate that the reason for the smaller force constant (FC) of C2 relative to HC≡CH has nothing to do with the bond energies, or with the number of bonds in the two molecules. The FC is determined primarily by the bond length, which is set by the balance between the bond length preferences of the σ- versus π-bonds in the two molecules. This interplay in the case of C2 clearly shows the fingerprints of the 4th bond. Our discussion resolves the points of contention and shows that the arguments used to dismiss the quadruple bond nature of C2 are not well founded.",

For systems in which no chemical transformation occurs, determination of interaction energies of the whole system with respect to the interaction energies between all individual component pairs (subsystems) will allow determination of cooperativity.

The nature of H+ in condensed media.\nRecent research has taught us that most protonated species are decidedly not well represented by a simple proton addition. What is the actual nature of the hydrogen ion (the \"proton\") when H(+), HA, H2A(+), and so forth are written in formulas, chemical equations, and acid catalyzed reactions? In condensed media, H(+) must be solvated and is nearly always dicoordinate, as illustrated by isolable bisdiethyletherate salts having H(OEt2)2(+) cations and weakly coordinating anions. Even carbocations such as protonated alkenes have significant C-H···anion hydrogen bonding that gives the active protons two-coordinate character. Hydrogen bonding is everywhere, particularly when acids are involved. In contrast to the normal, asymmetric O-H···O hydrogen bonding found in water, ice, and proteins, short, strong, low-barrier (SSLB) H-bonding commonly appears when strong acids are present. Unusually low frequency IR νOHO bands are a good indicator of SSLB H-bonds, and curiously, bands associated with group vibrations near H(+) in low-barrier H-bonding often disappear from the IR spectrum. Writing H3O(+) (the Eigen ion), as often appears in textbooks, might seem more realistic than H(+) for an ionized acid in water. However, this, too, is an unrealistic description of H(aq)(+). The dihydrated H(+) in the H5O2(+) cation (the Zundel ion) gets somewhat closer but still fails to rationalize all the experimental and computational data on H(aq)(+). Researchers do not understand the broad swath of IR absorption from H(aq)(+), known as the \"continuous broad absorption\" (cba). Theory has not reproduced the cba, but it appears to be the signature of delocalized protons whose motion is faster than the IR time scale. What does this mean for reaction mechanisms involving H(aq)(+)? For the past decade, the carborane acid H(CHB11Cl11) has been the strongest known Brønsted acid. (It is now surpassed by the fluorinated analogue H(CHB11F11).) Carborane acids are strong enough to protonate alkanes at room temperature, giving H2 and carbocations. They protonate chloroalkanes to give dialkylchloronium ions, which decay to carbocations. By partially protonating an oxonium cation, they get as close to the fabled H4O(2+) ion as can be achieved outside of a computer. ",

The manner in which a pair of anions can be held together despite an overall Coulombic repulsion is explained.

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies.

The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness.

With the two functionals and the triple-ζ basis set, the zwitterion is 1.70 kcal mol(-1) less stable than the reactants, and close to 1.63 kcal mol(-1) computed using the CCSD(T) approach. The inclusion of vibrational and thermal corrections and of entropic effects increases the relative energy of the zwitterion to 14.7 kcal mol(-1). Bending of the CO2 geometry increases its acidity due to a 1.09 eV reduction in the LUMO energy. Calculation of the CO2 interaction energy with a set of amines revealed that the interaction energies show a high correlation with their basicities, with the stronger bases stabilizing the zwitterion. For the most basic amine computed (3,4,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-2H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine), the Gibbs free energy of the zwitterion is 15.8 kcal mol(-1) lower than the reactants.

The potential energy surface has been further refined (with triple excitations, T) at the UCCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) level of theory. The results show that Cl(2) and O ((3)P) can be produced by chlorine atom abstraction via a tight transition state, while ClOCl ((1)A(1)) and ClClO ((1)A') can be formed by barrierless association processes with exothermicities of 31.8 and 16.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In principle the O ((1)D) atom can be generated with a large endothermicity of 56.9 kcal/mol; on the other hand, its barrierless reaction with Cl(2) can readily form ClClO ((1)A'), which fragments rapidly to give ClO + Cl. The rate constants of both forward and reverse processes have been predicted at 150-2000 K by the microcanonical variational transition state theory (VTST)/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory.

His synthetic and mechanistic studies have contributed to areas including non-benzenoid aromatics, carbenes, pericyclic reactions, and diradical intermediates. Doering's synthesis with L. H. Knox of the highly stable tropylium ion and their investigation of its reactivity were the starting point for the development of the field of non-benzenoid aromatics. Working with A. K. Hoffmann, Doering demonstrated the synthesis of dichloro- and dibromocarbene by base-induced alpha elimination of HCl or HBr from CHCl3 or CHBr3 under anhydrous conditions. These results allowed for the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and derivatives including allenes. Using 14C labeling experiments, Doering and Prinzbach showed that the mechanism of insertion of singlet methylene into a C-H bond was a concerted process.In their work on the Cope rearrangement, Doering and Roth's outstanding stereochemical analysis showed that the rearrangement of acyclic 1,5-hexadienes proceeds concertedly, passing over a chairlike transition state. This work has had an enormous impact on the understanding of stereochemical control in synthetic organic chemistry, and many fruitful applications in synthesis have stemmed directly from this finding. Transition-state resonance structures analogous to those for ground-state aromatics can qualitatively explain the relatively large substituent effects on the rate of the Cope rearrangement. However, quantum chemical calculations have quantitatively described these effects. The rapid degenerate Cope rearrangements in the cis-divinylcyclopropane units of 3,4-homotropilidene, barbaralone, and bullvalene establish these molecules as having fluxional structures. The unique molecule bullvalene has more than 1.2 million possible structures interconnected by degenerate Cope rearrangements, which average all H and all C atoms. Doering has also examined stepwise thermal reorganizations that pass through intermediary 1,3- or 1,4-diradicals and do not show conformational equilibration as would be expected for classical intermediates. Doering calls these processes \"not-obviously concerted\". He discusses \"continuous diradicals\" as transition states and rationalizes the course of these reactions through the concept of a \"caldera\" (a flat surface with small energy wells as found on the top of volcanoes).The understanding of fundamental chemical reactions remains the focus of Doering's research. In his terms, \"understanding\" means not only gaining deep insight but also the intellectual control that allows researchers to predict a reaction's course. Because the interplay between theory and experiment has led to great progress in this predictive ability, Doering's experimental work has provided an important input for computational chemistry and to the essential understanding of chemical reactions.",

Our attempts to generate and detect diazirinone (1) in either the condensed phase (using matrix isolation spectroscopy) or in the gas phase (using millimeter-wave rotational spectroscopy), however, have been unsuccessful. Trapping the volatile products produced from the reaction of 3-chloro-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)diazirine (5) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) under matrix-isolation conditions affords chlorofluorodiazirine (8) and carbon monoxide but fails to provide evidence for diazirinone (1).

This discrepancy lies well outside any expected solvent shift or calculation error at this level of theory. In an effort to reconcile our findings with the earlier reports concerning diazirinone (1), we reconsidered the infrared spectral evidence upon which the original claim of diazirinone synthesis was based.

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

For 1a, 4a, 6, and the previously analyzed 2 and 3 the crystal structures revealed characteristic interactions between the anions X and the three axial (out-of-plane) sulfur atoms S(ax) of the disulfido bridges. The Raman data showed a significant decrease of the S(eq)-S(ax) stretch resonance frequency in the order 4, 5, 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 3. This decrease is paralleled with a slight increase of the S(eq)-S(ax) bond length and with a significant shortening of the X.S(ax) distances when compared to the sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii. A comprehensive quantum chemical study, using both density functional theory and semiempirical calculations, revealed that for hard counterions such as NO(3)(-) and ClO(4)(-) the S(ax).X interactions can be understood in terms of an almost entirely electrostatic interaction, whereas for soft nucleophiles such as I(-) and S(2)(-) significant covalency is observed. In addition, the general reaction of [Mo(3)S(7)](4+) complexes with a nucleophile was modeled. With regard to the side-on bonding of the &amp;mgr;-S(2) groups to Mo, the calculations indicated a significantly higher bond energy for the axial (out-of-plane) sulfur atoms, explaining the much higher lability of the sulfur atoms in the equatorial (in-plane) position. Analogous differences for the ligating atoms of the peripheral ligands, having a cis and trans position with respect to &amp;mgr;(3)-S, are less pronounced.",

Thirteen minimum isomers and 29 transition states are located. The initial association between (1)CHCl and NO(2) proceeds most likely through the carbon-to-middle-nitrogen attack leading to an energy-rich adduct a (HClCNO(2)), which is found to be a barrierless process. Staring from a, the most feasible channel is to undergo a concerted O-shift and C--N bond rupture leading to product P(2) (NO + HClCO). The minor product pathways are the direct O-extrusion of a to P(3) (O + HClCNO-cis) as well as the 1,3-H-shift of a to isomer b (ClCNOOH) followed by a concerted OH-shift leading to d (HOClCNO), which will dissociate to product P(8) (NO + ClCOH) via C--N cleavage. Because the transition states and isomers involved in the most feasible channel all lie below the reactants, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured rate constant at 296 K.

The barrier heights decrease on going from left to right in the periodic table, and increasing ionization energy (of X- and XH) is correlated with decreasing barrier. The observed trends are explained in terms of substrates with stronger electrostatic character giving rise to lower energetic barriers due to decreased electron repulsion in the transition structure. On the basis of this study, the relationship between the kinetic concept of nucleophilicity and the thermodynamic concept of basicity has been analyzed and clarified. Since the trends in intrinsic nucleophilicity (only defined for identity reactions) and basicity are opposite, overall nucleophilicity (defined for any reaction) will be determined by the relative contribution of the two factors.

Conformation and geometry of 1b were determined by comparing measured NMR chemical shifts with the corresponding chemical shifts calculated at the DFT-IGLO level of theory where it had to be considered that the molecule exists in two enantiomeric forms. Measured and calculated 1H chemical shifts agree within 0.1 ppm while the calculated 13C shift of the COO carbon (210.6 ppm) differs by only 0.4 ppm from the measured shift of 211.0 ppm. The two mesityl rings are perpendicular to each other and enclose angles of 40 and 57 degrees with the COO plane. The preferred rearrangement process of 1b is an H migration from one of the ortho-methyl groups to the terminal O atom of the COO unit. The calculated activation enthalpy of this process is 12.7 kcal/mol (B3LYP/cc-pVTZ). In contrast, the activation enthalpy for isomerization to dioxirane is 5 kcal/mol higher. In CCl3F, the activation barrier for the thermal decay was determined to be 13.8 +/- 0.2 kcal/mol and in acetonitrile 13.1 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol. H migration initiates cleavage of the OO bond and the production of an OH and a benzyl radical.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

The results show that Cl(2) and O ((3)P) can be produced by chlorine atom abstraction via a tight transition state, while ClOCl ((1)A(1)) and ClClO ((1)A') can be formed by barrierless association processes with exothermicities of 31.8 and 16.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In principle the O ((1)D) atom can be generated with a large endothermicity of 56.9 kcal/mol; on the other hand, its barrierless reaction with Cl(2) can readily form ClClO ((1)A'), which fragments rapidly to give ClO + Cl. The rate constants of both forward and reverse processes have been predicted at 150-2000 K by the microcanonical variational transition state theory (VTST)/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory. The predicted rate constants are in good agreement with available experimental data within reported errors.",

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies.

A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive. The channel leading to p1 (N2O + CN) has the lowest energy (3.81 kcal/mol), whereas the channels leading to p2 (N2 + NCO) and p2s (N2 + NCS) are the most exothermic (100.94 and 107.38 kcal/mol, respectively).",

Things are too long away now for introducing any change, but one should remember that using Norrish name here is a mistake, while it would be appropriate to add the name of Ciamician for a different name reaction, the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of alkenes and conjugated carbonyls.

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Thirteen minimum isomers and 29 transition states are located. The initial association between (1)CHCl and NO(2) proceeds most likely through the carbon-to-middle-nitrogen attack leading to an energy-rich adduct a (HClCNO(2)), which is found to be a barrierless process. Staring from a, the most feasible channel is to undergo a concerted O-shift and C--N bond rupture leading to product P(2) (NO + HClCO). The minor product pathways are the direct O-extrusion of a to P(3) (O + HClCNO-cis) as well as the 1,3-H-shift of a to isomer b (ClCNOOH) followed by a concerted OH-shift leading to d (HOClCNO), which will dissociate to product P(8) (NO + ClCOH) via C--N cleavage. Because the transition states and isomers involved in the most feasible channel all lie below the reactants, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured rate constant at 296 K.

Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed.

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

P. Hammett's book of that title, although substantial earlier work can be traced back to the turn of the 20th century. Many of the instrumental tools that helped the discipline develop in so many different ways began to appear in the late thirties and during World War II and were soon built to be increasingly operated in the \"hands-on\" mode. This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were (14)C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of (19)F, (13)C, and (15)N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring Huckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists. From the very beginning of my research career, I have been the beneficiary of personal mentoring which has been very crucial to my success in research and is an important theme in what follows.",

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

In this work, a density functional theory study of the reaction mechanism is presented. Earlier experiments have revealed that the same reaction occurring on mercury surfaces generates a mixture of CO and formate. According to the proposed mechanism, an η(1)-CO2 adduct is the precursor for CO evolution, whereas formate is obtained from an η(1)-OCO adduct. Our calculations show that generation of the η(1)-CO2 adduct is energetically favored by ∼14.0 kcal/mol relative to that of the η(1)-OCO complex, thus rationalizing the product selectivity observed experimentally. Binding of η(1)-CO2 to Ni(I) only leads to partial electron transfer from the metal center to CO2. Hence, further CO2 functionalization likely proceeds via an outer-sphere electron-transfer mechanism, for which concerted proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) is calculated to be the most feasible route. Final C-O bond cleavage involves rather low barriers in the presence of H3O(+) and H2CO3 and is therefore essentially concerted with the preceding PCET. As a result, the entire reaction mechanism can be described as concerted proton-electron transfer and C-O bond cleavage. On the basis of the theoretical results, the limitations of the catalytic activity of Ni(cyclam) are discussed, which sheds light on future design of more efficient catalysts. ",

For Ni-, the feed order must be CO2 first, as the weaker donor-acceptor interaction between Ni- and CH4 raises a high C-H activation barrier, which is reduced by [Ni-CO2]-. For Ni-/Pt-, the highly exothermic products A and B are similarly stable with submerged barrier that favors B. The smaller barrier difference between A and B for Ni- suggests the C-C coupling product is more competitive for Ni- than Pt-.  The charge redistribution from M- is the driving force for product B channel. This study adds our understanding of single atomic anions to activate CH4 and CO2 simultaneously.",

Similar correlations are also found with the electronegativity of central atoms in X, deformation energy of the E2 transition state (TS), and the overall enthalpy of reaction. It is revealed that the electronegativity will significantly affect the barrier height, and a more electronegative X will stabilize the E2 and SN2 transition states.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Complex 7 has the open bioctahedral structure [(t-BuNC)2ClRe(mu-dppE)2ReCl2(CN-t-Bu)]+, which is quite different from that of the edge-sharing bioctahedron found in salts of the [Re2Cl3(mu-dppm)2(CNXyl)3]+ cation and its neutral congener Re2Cl3(mu-dppm)2(CNXyl)3; preliminary crystallographic data for the latter compound show the structure to be (XylNC)ClRe(mu-Cl)(mu-CNXyl)(mu-dppm)2ReCl(CNXyl) with an all-cis arrangement of XylNC ligands. The Re-Re bond distances of 2, 6, 7, 11, and 12 occur in the range 2.289-2.380 A and are consistent in all instances with the retention of a Re identical to Re bond, albeit weakened by some degree of Re--&gt;CNR(pi*) back-bonding.",

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4. In this case, computational results support electrochemical data in backing a direct electron transfer reaction.",

Geometries of the reactants, transition states, intermediates, and products were optimized at HF and B3LYP levels of theory using the 6-31G(d) basis set. Energies were also obtained using single point calculations at the MP2/6-31G(d)//HF/6-31G(d), MP2/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) levels of theory. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were performed to characterize the transition states on the potential energy surface. Only one pathway was found for the reaction of Ad=Ad with one Br2 producing a bromonium/bromide ion pair. Three mechanisms for the reaction of Ad=Ad with 2Br2 were found, leading to three different structural forms of the bromonium/Br3- ion pair. Activation energies, free energies, and enthalpies of activation along with the relative stability of products for each reaction pathway were calculated. The reaction of Ad=Ad with 2Br2 was strongly favored over the reaction with only one Br2. According to B3LYP/6-31G(d) and single point calculations at MP2, the most stable bromonium/Br3- ion pair would form spontaneously. The most stable of the three bromonium/Br3- ion pairs has a structure very similar to the observed X-ray structure. Free energies of activation and relative stabilities of reactants and products in CCl4 and CH2ClCH2Cl were also calculated with PCM using the united atom (UA0) cavity model and, in general, results similar to the gas phase were obtained.

Br2 (12), 3 . Br2 (13) and 4 . Br2 (14). A conductometric and spectrophotometric investigation into the reaction between 1-4 and Br2, carried out in MeCN, allows the equilibria involved in the formation of the isolated 10-E-3 (E = S, Se) hypervalent compounds to be hypothesised. In order to understand the reasons why S and Se donors can give different product types on treatment with Br2 and I2, DFT calculations have been carried out on 1-8, 19 and 20, and on their corresponding hypothetical [LEX]+ cations (L = organic framework; E = S, Se; X = Br, I), which are considered to be key intermediates in the formation of the different products. The results obtained in terms of NBO charge distribution on [LEX]+ species explain the different behaviour of 1-8, 19 and 20 in their reactions with Br2 and I2 fairly well. X-ray diffraction studies show 12-14 to have a T-shaped (10-E-3; E = S, Se) hypervalent chalcogen nature. They contain an almost linear Br-E-Br (E = S, Se) system roughly perpendicular to the average plane of the organic molecules. In 12, the Se atom of each adduct molecule has a short interaction with the Br(1) atom of an adjacent unit, such that the Se atom displays a roughly square planar coordination. The Se-Br distances are asymmetric [2.529(1) vs. 2.608(1) A], the shorter distance being that with the Br(1) atom involved in the short intermolecular contact. In contrast, in the molecular adducts 13 and 14, which lie on a two-fold crystallographic axis, the Br-E-Br system is symmetric and no short intermolecular interactions involving chalcogen and bromine atoms are observed. The adducts are arranged in parallel planes; this gives rise to a graphite-like stacking. The new crystalline modification of 10, obtained from acetonitrile solution, confirms the importance of short intermolecular contacts in determining the asymmetry of Br-E-Br (E = S, Se) and I-Se-I groups in hypervalent 10-E-3 compounds. The analogies in the conductometric and spectrophotometric titrations of 1 and 2-4 with Br2, together with the similarity of the vibrational spectra of 11-14, also imply a T-shaped nature for 11. The vibrational properties of the Br-E-Br (E = S, Se) systems resemble those of the Br3- and IBr2- anions: the Raman spectrum of a symmetric Br-E-Br group shows only one peak near 160 cm(-1), as found for symmetric Br3- and IBr2- anions, while asymmetric Br-E-Br groups also show an antisymmetric Br-E-Br mode at around 190 cm(-1), as observed for asymmetric Br3- and IBr2- ions. Therefore, simple IR and Raman measurements provide a useful tool for distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric Br-E-Br groups, and hence allow predictions about the crystal packing of these hypervalent chalcogen compounds to be made when crystals of good quality are not available.",

The course of the reactions was followed by (i) monitoring the vapor pressure inside the reactor, (ii) observing the heat dissipation during ClF uptake, and (iii) measuring the volume of the released nitrogen gas. Since the fluorination of the last cyano group proceeds very slowly, the selective synthesis of K[(CF(3))(3)BCN] on a 0.2 molar scale is possible, as well.

The previously reported crystal structure of 1 was reinvestigated. The X-ray analysis revealed the incorporation of CH(2)Cl(2) in the crystal having the composition [Mo(3)S(7)(dtc)(3)]I.0.5CH(2)Cl(2) (1a), which was in contradiction to the previous protocol. The corresponding ClO(4)(-) compound (4a) is isotypic. Crystal data: C(15.5)H(31)Cl(2)Mo(3)N(3)O(4)S(13), orthorhombic space group Aba2, a = 25.816(5) Å, b = 17.761(4) Å, c = 16.250(3) Å, Z = 8. For 1a, 4a, 6, and the previously analyzed 2 and 3 the crystal structures revealed characteristic interactions between the anions X and the three axial (out-of-plane) sulfur atoms S(ax) of the disulfido bridges. The Raman data showed a significant decrease of the S(eq)-S(ax) stretch resonance frequency in the order 4, 5, 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 3. This decrease is paralleled with a slight increase of the S(eq)-S(ax) bond length and with a significant shortening of the X.S(ax) distances when compared to the sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii. A comprehensive quantum chemical study, using both density functional theory and semiempirical calculations, revealed that for hard counterions such as NO(3)(-) and ClO(4)(-) the S(ax).X interactions can be understood in terms of an almost entirely electrostatic interaction, whereas for soft nucleophiles such as I(-) and S(2)(-) significant covalency is observed. In addition, the general reaction of [Mo(3)S(7)](4+) complexes with a nucleophile was modeled. With regard to the side-on bonding of the &amp;mgr;-S(2) groups to Mo, the calculations indicated a significantly higher bond energy for the axial (out-of-plane) sulfur atoms, explaining the much higher lability of the sulfur atoms in the equatorial (in-plane) position.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO. At a temperature of 50 degrees C under 1 atm of CO the net reaction 4(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + H(2)S --&gt; 2HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO occurs within minutes without formation of detectable amounts of HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5).",

Despite this, his contributions have often been overshadowed by those of Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, who also played critical roles in preparing the gas and understanding its nature. Sadly, Scheele was slow to publish his discovery and therefore Priestley is rightly recognized as the first person to report the preparation of oxygen. This being said, the thinking of both Scheele and Priestley was dominated by the phlogiston theory, and it was left to Lavoisier to elucidate the true nature of oxygen. In addition to his work on oxygen, Scheele was enormously productive in other areas of chemistry. Arguably he discovered seven new elements and many other compounds. However, he kept a low profile during his life as a pharmacist, and he did not have strong links with contemporary prestigious institutions such as the Royal Society in England or the French Académie des Sciences. He was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Science but only attended one meeting.

Experiments were carried out in a plug-flow reactor at temperatures between 873 and 1173 K. Under these conditions, CH(2)CF(2) was a dominant product observed, with CH(2)F(2), C(2)H(2), CH(2)CHF, C(2)F(4), C(2)H(6) and CHFCF(2) also detected. In the presence of less than 6000 ppm of CBrF(3), the rate of formation of CH(2)CF(2) is significantly enhanced, and a much lower rate of formation of the major by-product, C(2)F(4) is observed. Further increasing the proportion of CBrF(3) in the feed resulted in an even higher rate of formation of CH(2)CF(2).

The measurements were carried out in Pyrex reactors using a mixture of CFCl2H, CH4, and Cl2 in either N2 or N2/O2 diluent. Reactants and products were quantified by GC/FID analysis. Cl atoms were generated by irradiation of the mixture with 360 nm light to dissociate the Cl2 for temperatures up to ~550 K. At higher temperature, the Cl2 dissociated thermally, and no irradiation was used. Over the temperature range 298-670 K, k1 is consistently a factor of ~5 smaller than that of k2 with a nearly identical temperature dependence. The optimum non-Arrhenius rate constant is represented by the expression k1 = 1.14 × 10(-22) T(3.49) e(-241/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) with an estimated uncertainty of ±15% including uncertainty in the reference reaction.

As such, the need to follow complex processes in intact media and mixtures is becoming commonplace. Here, a targeted NMR experiment is introduced which selectively detects the formation of 13C-12C bonds in mixtures. This study introduces the experiment on simple standards, and then demonstrates the potential on increasingly complex processes including: fermentation, Arabidopsis thaliana germination/early growth, and metabolism in Daphnia magna both ex vivo and in vivo. As signals from the intact 12C and 13C pools are themselves filtered out, correlations are only observed when a component from each pool combines (i.e. new 13C-12C bonds) in the formation of new structures. This targeted approach significantly reduces the complexity of the mixtures and provides information on the fate and reactivity of carbon in environmental and biological processes. The experiment has application to follow bond formation wherever two pools of carbon are brought together, be it the incorporation of 13C enriched food into a living organism's biomass, or the degradation of 13C enriched plant material in soil.",

Chem., 15, 2004) revealed that these intermediates were formed at high OH(-) concentrations via the chemically preferred pathway of breaking the C-C bond between the two cyclopentanes, thereby eliminating nitro groups, forming conjugated pi bonds, and resulting in a pyrazine three-ring aromatic intermediate.

This regulation makes GBL chemical mixtures, in concentrations greater than 70 percent, subject to List I chemical regulatory requirements of the CSA, except if exempted through an existing categorical exemption. DEA is taking this action because there is a serious threat to the public safety associated with the ease by which GBL is chemically converted to the schedule I controlled substance gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB).

Among the foremost advantages of qHNMR is its accurate function with external calibration, the lack of any requirement for identical reference materials, a high precision and accuracy when properly validated, and an ability to quantitate multiple analytes simultaneously. As a result of the inclusion of over 170 new references, this updated review summarizes a wealth of detailed experiential evidence and newly developed methodology that supports qHNMR as a valuable and unbiased analytical tool for natural product and other areas of research.",

Prior to their application these molecules must be fully characterized with respect to their CO-release mechanism. One widely used CORM for biological application is sodium boranocarbonate (CORM-A1), which shows pH-dependent CO liberation. The complete reaction mechanism of CORM-A1 is not fully understood yet. Therefore, in this contribution time-resolved gas-phase IR spectroscopy is used to monitor the headspace above decaying CORM-A1 solutions at four different pH values (5.8 to 7.4). Borane carbonyl is found as an intermediate in the gas phase, which is formed during CORM degradation and further decays to CO. Concentration profiles of a pseudoconsecutive first-order reaction are successfully fitted to specific band areas of the measured gas-phase spectra, and the rate constants are obtained. The production of borane carbonyl is strongly pH dependent (half-lives between 5 and 106 min), whereas the decay of borane carbonyl in the gas phase is nearly constant with a half-life of about 33 min. The ratio of liberated CO molecules per CORM-A1 is determined to be 0.91±0.09, and boric acid is identified as further end product. ",

Melting and boiling points as characteristic values emerge from this study as products of laboratory standardization, developed by chemists in their struggle to classify, understand and control organic nature. A major argument here concerns the role played by the introduction of organic synthesis in driving these changes. Synthetic organic chemistry vastly increased the number of known organic substances, precipitating the chemical identity crisis of my title. Successful natural product synthesis, moreover, depended on chemists' ability to demonstrate the absolute identity of synthetic product and natural target--something late nineteenth-century chemists eventually achieved by making reliable, replicable melting and boiling point measurements.

At first one cyano group of K[B(CN)(4)] is converted fast into a CF(3) group, and with increasing fluorination the reaction becomes slower and several intermediates could be observed. On the basis of these results, a synthesis was developed for K[B(CF(3))(4)] on a 0.2 molar scale by treatment of K[B(CN)(4)] diluted in aHF with ClF. The course of the reactions was followed by (i) monitoring the vapor pressure inside the reactor, (ii) observing the heat dissipation during ClF uptake, and (iii) measuring the volume of the released nitrogen gas. Since the fluorination of the last cyano group proceeds very slowly, the selective synthesis of K[(CF(3))(3)BCN] on a 0.2 molar scale is possible, as well.

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner.

The course of the reactions was followed by (i) monitoring the vapor pressure inside the reactor, (ii) observing the heat dissipation during ClF uptake, and (iii) measuring the volume of the released nitrogen gas. Since the fluorination of the last cyano group proceeds very slowly, the selective synthesis of K[(CF(3))(3)BCN] on a 0.2 molar scale is possible, as well.

Synthesis, purification, compositional analysis, stability, and experimental/theoretical structure elucidation, including the X-ray structure of C(1)-C(60)Cl(10).\nThe efficacy of various analytical techniques for the characterization of products of C(60) chlorination reactions were evaluated by (i) using samples of C(60)Cl(6) of known purity and (ii) repeating a number of literature syntheses reported to yield pure C(60)Cl(n) compounds. The techniques were NMR, UV-vis, IR, and Raman spectroscopy, FAB, MALDI, LDI, ESI, and APCI mass spectrometry, HPLC, TGA, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Most of these techniques are shown to give ambiguous or erroneous results, calling into question the composition and/or purity of nearly all C(60)Cl(n) compounds reported to date. The optimum analytical method for chlorofullerenes was found to be a combination of HPLC and either MALDI or APCI mass spectrometry. For the first time, the chlorination of C(60) by ICl, ICl(3), and Cl(2) was studied in detail using dynamic HPLC analysis and APCI mass spectrometry. Suitable conditions were found for the preparation of the new chlorofullerenes 1,7-C(60)Cl(2), 1,9-C(60)Cl(2), 1,6,9,18-C(60)Cl(4), and 1,2,7,10,14,24,25,28,29,31-C(60)Cl(10). The latter compound was also studied by (13)C NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, which led to the unambiguous determination of its asymmetric addition pattern. The unusual structure of C(60)Cl(10) was compared with other possible isomers using DFT-predicted relative energies. These results, along with additional experimental data and an analysis of the DFT-predicted frontier orbitals of likely intermediates, were used to rationalize the formation of the new compound C(60)Cl(10) from C(60)Cl(6) and excess ICl without the rearrangement of any C-Cl bonds. For the first time, the stability of C(60)Cl(n) compounds under a variety of conditions was studied in detail, leading to the discovery that they are, in general, very light-sensitive in solution. The X-ray structure of C(60)Cl(6) was also redetermined with higher precision.",

Complexes 1-3 are isolable as air-stable, analytically pure yellow solids in good to moderate yields by chromatography or fractional crystallization. In solutions, complex 1 exists as two coordination isomers in an 83:17 ratio differing with respect to the endo/exo orientation of the allyl ligand. In contrast, complexes 2 and 3 each exist as four coordination isomers, all differing by the orientation of their allyl ligands which can have either an endo or an exo orientation with the phenyl or methyl groups being either proximal or distal to the nitrosyl ligand. A DFT computational analysis using the major isomer of Cp*W(NO)(H)(η(3)-CH2CHCHMe) (3a) as the model complex has revealed that its lowest-energy thermal-decomposition pathway involves the intramolecular isomerization of 3a to the 16e η(2)-alkene complex, Cp*W(NO)(η(2)-CH2═CHCH2Me).

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

At first one cyano group of K[B(CN)(4)] is converted fast into a CF(3) group, and with increasing fluorination the reaction becomes slower and several intermediates could be observed. On the basis of these results, a synthesis was developed for K[B(CF(3))(4)] on a 0.2 molar scale by treatment of K[B(CN)(4)] diluted in aHF with ClF. The course of the reactions was followed by (i) monitoring the vapor pressure inside the reactor, (ii) observing the heat dissipation during ClF uptake, and (iii) measuring the volume of the released nitrogen gas. Since the fluorination of the last cyano group proceeds very slowly, the selective synthesis of K[(CF(3))(3)BCN] on a 0.2 molar scale is possible, as well. The analysis of the mechanisms, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the fluorination reactions is supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Importantly, the scaffolds were accessible in a single operation from commercially available sources containing R-groups which were then linked combinatorially. This resulted in a combinatorial database of over 28 million product structures, each of which is synthetically feasible. These structures can be accessed through a free Web-based 2D structure search engine or downloaded in SMILES, MOL2, and SDF formats. Subsets include a 10% diversity subset, a drug-like subset, and a lead-like subset that are also freely available for download and virtual screening ( http://mmg.rcsi.ie:8080/tin ). ",

Most practicing chemists view it as the electron-attracting power of an atom in a molecule. Various formulations of electronegativity have been proposed on this basis, and predictions made using different formulations generally agree reasonably well with each other and with chemical experience. A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

It can be estimated from the common inhibition plots used in biochemistry by means of the fact that the extrapolated inhibitor concentration at which the rate becomes infinite is equal to -i(0.5). This method is, in principle, more accurate than comparing the rates at various different inhibitor concentrations, and inferring the value of i(0.5) by interpolation. Its reciprocal, 1/i(0.5), is linearly dependent on v(0)/V, the uninhibited rate divided by the limiting rate, and the extrapolated value of v(0)/V at which 1/i(0.5) is zero allows the type of inhibition to be characterized: this value is 1 if the inhibition is strictly competitive; greater than 1 if the inhibition is mixed with a predominantly competitive component; infinite (i.e. 1/i(0.5) does not vary with v(0)/V) if the inhibition is pure non-competitive (i.e. mixed with competitive and uncompetitive components equal); negative if the inhibition is mixed with a predominantly uncompetitive component; and zero if it is strictly uncompetitive. The type of analysis proposed has been tested experimentally by examining inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by oxalate (an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to pyruvate) and oxamate (a competitive inhibitor with respect to pyruvate), and of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase by hydroxymalonate (a mixed inhibitor with respect to oxaloacetate).

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory.

As for the Marcus equation, the new potential function depends only on two parameters, the reaction energy and the activation energy (or the so-called Marcus intrinsic activation energy). Combination of the Marcus potential with the reaction force analysis provides two-parameter analytic expressions for the reaction force, reaction force constant, and reaction works. Moreover, since the parameters necessary to define the Marcus potential energy function can be obtained experimentally, the present model may produce experimental analytic potentials allowing for new and interesting applications, thus emerging as a powerful tool to characterize activation processes in chemical reactions.",

Since then, attempts have been made to generalise the Schild equation, but they are all based on false premises. It turns out that generalisation is usually not needed.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

The minima and maxima of F(R) provide a natural division of the process into several regions. Those in which F(R) is increasing are where the most dramatic changes in electronic properties take place, and where the system goes from activated reactants (at the force minimum) to activated products (at the force maximum). Kappa(R) is negative throughout such a region. We summarize evidence supporting the idea that a reaction should be viewed as going through a transition region rather than through a single point transition state. A similar conclusion has come out of transition state spectroscopy. We describe this region as a chemically-active, or electronically-intensive, stage of the reaction, while the ones that precede and follow it are structurally-intensive. Finally, we briefly address the time dependence of the reaction force and the reaction force constant.",

More uncertain, however, is whether or not these concepts are fundamental to biology and living processes. Of course, at the fundamental level all things are quantum, because all things are built from the quantized states and rules that govern atoms. But when does the quantum mechanical toolkit become the best tool for the job? This review looks at four areas of 'quantum effects in biology'. These are biosystems that are very diverse in detail but possess some commonality. They are all (i) <ieffects</i in biology: rates of a signal (or information) that can be calculated from a form of the 'golden rule' and (ii) they are all protein-pigment (or ligand) complex systems. It is shown, beginning with the rate equation, that all these systems may contain some degree of <iquantum</ieffect, and where experimental evidence is available, it is explored to determine how the quantum analysis aids in understanding of the process.",

Here, we show using statistical mechanics that this principle is equivalent to a force law ⟨ ⟨ f ⟩ ⟩ &gt; 0 in systems where mass centers and forces can be identified. The sign of this net force--the average mean force along a path from A to B--determines the direction of the process.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Topics included the value of Avogadro's constant, the dimensions of a molecule, equations of state for non-ideal gases, then-current theories relating electron configurations to the Periodic Law, the then-new nuclear atom model of Rutherford, and the first findings from X-ray crystallographic studies of matter, a field then in its nascent phase. This article is a sequel to that work. As a vast quantity of research has been addressed to the topic in the intervening period, the view presented here can at best be selective and idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, it attempts to capture some of the important strides in 'matter science', broadly defined, over the past century, highlight some recent areas of interest or novelty, and give a picture of some of the mysteries that remain.",

Lewis and the chemical bond: the electron pair and the octet rule from 1916 to the present day.\nWe describe the development of Lewis's ideas concerning the chemical bond and in particular the concept of the electron pair bond and the octet rule. We show that the concept of the electron pair bond has endured to the present day and is now understood to be a consequence of the Pauli principle. In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory. The electron density distribution in a molecule can now be analyzed using the ELF and other functions of the electron density to show where electron pairs are most probably to be found in a molecule.",

No basis for it is found in thermodynamics or statistical mechanics. The appropriate correction for center-of-mass translational motion is derived from classical statistical mechanics.

In any case, this latter correction, however legitimate, is shown to be futile, since it has long been recognized from classical statistical mechanics that all terms involving momenta (thermal wavelength terms)-be they classified as translational, rotational, vibrational, or whatever-necessarily cancel out in forming the standard free energy change of any chemical reaction from the constituent standard chemical potentials.",

It takes significance tests--which place all value on the replicability of an effect and none on its magnitude--as a special case, one in which the cost of a false positive is revealed to be an order of magnitude greater than the value of a true positive. More realistic utility functions credit both replicability and effect size, integrating them for a single index of merit. The analysis incorporates opportunity cost and is consistent with alternate measures of effect size, such as r2 and information transmission, and with Bayesian model selection criteria.

Conventional elementary mathematical descriptions of quantum mechanics take \"measurement\" to be a primitive concept. Paradoxes arise when we choose to consider smaller or larger systems as measurement devices in their own right, by making different and apparently arbitrary choices of location of the \"Heisenberg cut\". Various quantum interpretations have different resolutions of the paradox. In Belavkin's approach, the classical world around us does really exist, and it evolves stochastically and dynamically in time according to probability laws following from successive applications of the Born law. It is a collapse theory. The quantum/classical distinction is determined by the arrow of time. The underlying unitary evolution of the wave-function of the universe enables the designation of a collection of beables which grows as time evolves, and which therefore can be assigned random, classical trajectories. In a slogan: the past is particles, the future is a wave. We, living in the now, are located on the cutting edge between past and future.",

Participants were shown the colored patterns on each side of a 6-sided die and were asked how sure they were that a conditional holds of the side landing upward when the die is randomly thrown. Participants were presented with 71 trials consisting of all combinations of binary dimensions of shape (e.g., circles and squares) and color (e.g., blue and red) painted onto the sides of each die. In 2 experiments (N₁ = 66, N₂ = 65), the conditional event was the dominant interpretation, followed by conjunction, and material conditional responses were negligible. In both experiments, the percentage of participants giving a conditional event response increased from around 40% at the beginning of the task to nearly 80% at the end, with most participants shifting from a conjunction interpretation. The shift was moderated by the order of shape and color in each conditional's antecedent and consequent: Participants were more likely to shift if the antecedent referred to a color. In Experiment 2 we collected response times: Conditional event interpretations took longer to process than conjunction interpretations (mean difference = 500 ms).

Some conjunction fallacies, however, have been ascribed to the incorrect rules people use to combine probabilities. In 2 experiments, representativeness was pitted against probability combination to determine the contributions of each to the fallacy. Even for exemplar representativeness problems, the fallacy stemmed primarily from the application of incorrect combination rules. Representativeness seemed to be involved only insofar as it influenced the probabilities of a conjunction's component events.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

The total rate constant for the reaction has been measured by means of the cavity ring-down spectrometry (CRDS) in the temperature range 299-501 K at pressures covering 20-75 Torr. The overall bimolecular rate constant can be represented by the expression k = (2.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(11) exp[-(700 +/- 30)/T] cm3 mol-1 s-1, which is slightly faster than for the analogous C6H5 + CH2O reaction determined with the same method in the same temperature range. The reaction mechanism for the C6H5 + CH3CHO reaction was also explored with quantum-chemical calculations at various hybrid density functional theories (DFTs) and using ab initio high-level composite methods. The theories predict that the reaction may occur by two hydrogen-abstraction and two addition channels with the aldehydic hydrogen-abstraction reaction being dominant. The rate constant calculated by the transition state theory for the aldehydic hydrogen-abstraction reaction is in good agreement with the experimental result after a very small adjustment of the predicted reaction barrier (+0.3 kcal mol-1). Contributions from other product channels are negligible under our experimental conditions.

The rate of reaction is not inhibited by CO. The kinetic isotope effect for reaction of D-Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) is k(H)/k(D) = 1.7. These observations are consistent with a first step involving direct H (D) atom transfer from the metal hydride to *NO, forming HNO.

On the fundamental side, the focus is on the approaches of increasing complexity to compute and represent χ(r,r'), its visualisation going from plots of the unintegrated χ(r,r') to an atom condensed matrix. The study on atoms reveals its physical significance, retrieving atomic shell structure, while the results on molecules illustrate that a variety of chemical concepts are retrieved: inductive and mesomeric effects, electron delocalisation, aromaticity and anti-aromaticity, σ and π aromaticity,…. The applications show that the chemistry of aliphatic (saturated and unsaturated) chains, saturated and aromatic/anti-aromatic rings, organic, inorganic or metallic in nature, can be retrieved via the linear response function, including the variation of the electronic structure of the reagents along a reaction path.

Also provided are the thermochemical consequences of functional group replacements, in which one group in a molecule is substituted by another, thus providing quick short cuts to estimating new Δ(f)H(0) values. Results derived from the new additivity terms are consistent with those produced by computational chemistry methods in general use.",

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness. The strong correlation between the hardness and the Fukui potential at the nucleus suggests that the Fukui potential at the nucleus is an alternative definition for the chemical hardness.",

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions.

The geometric parameters of the reactants, products, and transition states are optimized by both UMPW1PW91 and unrestricted coupled-cluster single and double excitation (UCCSD) methods with the 6-311+G(3df) basis set. The potential energy surface has been further refined (with triple excitations, T) at the UCCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) level of theory. The results show that Cl(2) and O ((3)P) can be produced by chlorine atom abstraction via a tight transition state, while ClOCl ((1)A(1)) and ClClO ((1)A') can be formed by barrierless association processes with exothermicities of 31.8 and 16.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In principle the O ((1)D) atom can be generated with a large endothermicity of 56.9 kcal/mol; on the other hand, its barrierless reaction with Cl(2) can readily form ClClO ((1)A'), which fragments rapidly to give ClO + Cl. The rate constants of both forward and reverse processes have been predicted at 150-2000 K by the microcanonical variational transition state theory (VTST)/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory. The predicted rate constants are in good agreement with available experimental data within reported errors.",

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies. The mechanism is similar to those of the HO-C(2)H(2)/C(2)H(4) systems. The rate constants for the low energy channels have been predicted by statistical theory. For the reaction of ClO and C(2)H(2), the main channels are the production of CH(2)CO + Cl (k(1a)) and CHCO + HCl (k(1b)), with k(1a) = 1.19 × 10(-15)T(1.18) exp(-5814/T) and k(1b) = 6.94 × 10(-21) × T(2.60) exp(-6587/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1).

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

Cl atoms were generated by UV photolysis of oxalyl chloride ((COCl)2) at 254 nm, and nitrogen was used as the diluent gas. The rate coefficient for the reaction of Cl atoms with p-cymene at 298 K was measured to be (2.58 ± 1.55) × 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The kinetic data obtained over the temperature range 288-350 K were used to derive an Arrhenius expression: k(T) = (9.36 ± 2.90) × 10(-10) exp[-(488 ± 98)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). Theoretical kinetic calculations were also performed for the title reaction using canonical variational transition state theory (CVT) with small curvature tunneling (SCT) between 250 and 400 K.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Herein we will evaluate from mathematical, physical and applied perspectives the advantages in using the energy representation for the depiction of the kinetics of catalysis, compared to the usual rate constant representation. We will discuss many concepts such as the energy span, the determining states, the determining zone, graph theory, affinity, degrees of rate control, robustness and volcano plots. Special emphasis will be put on the effect of reactants' and products' concentrations, and how to easily and accurately understand their influence on the kinetics. Ultimately, we will try to explore if energy truly is the measure of all things.",

The reaction force constant κ(R), the second derivative of V(R), is negative throughout the transition region, not just at the nominal transition state, at which κ(R) has a minimum. This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous. (We speculate that for a nonconcerted process this maximum is actually positive.) Thus, κ(R) can serve as an indicator of the level of nonsynchronicity.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide-ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.",

Furthermore, we show that it implies Pearson's hard/soft acid/base principle mathematically and confirm this result with numerical examples.

Possible mechanisms were classified according to four pathways yielding products in the following four possible groups: N2O/N2S + CN, N2 + NCO/NCS, N2 + CNO/CNS, and CNN + NO/NS, labeled in order from p1/p1s to p4/p4s. The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive. The channel leading to p1 (N2O + CN) has the lowest energy (3.81 kcal/mol), whereas the channels leading to p2 (N2 + NCO) and p2s (N2 + NCS) are the most exothermic (100.94 and 107.38 kcal/mol, respectively).",

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies.

The calculation indicates that the hydrogen abstraction from -CH(2)- group is the dominant reaction channel, and the displacement process may be negligible because of the high barrier. The rate constants for individual reaction channels are calculated by the improved canonical variational transition-state theory with small-curvature tunneling correction over the temperature range of 220-1500 K.

The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive. The channel leading to p1 (N2O + CN) has the lowest energy (3.81 kcal/mol), whereas the channels leading to p2 (N2 + NCO) and p2s (N2 + NCS) are the most exothermic (100.94 and 107.38 kcal/mol, respectively).",

This study provides new lines of evidence about the reaction through exploration of the reaction mechanism using the CCSD(T) method and solving the corresponding master equation by following two main approaches. According to the results, the rate coefficient of the reaction is significantly influenced by the tunneling and hindered rotation effects, in addition to the selected total angular momentum (<iJ</i). Furthermore, the total rate coefficient of the reaction increases dramatically (from 10<sup7</sup to 10<sup11</sup L mol<sup-1</sup s<sup-1</sup) with the rise of temperature from 100 to 4000 K, while the total rate coefficient is insensitive to pressure (0.1-10 atm). Despite some differences between the results of the two approaches, the rate coefficients of both methods are consistent with the previously reported rate coefficients. Also, in agreement with the previous studies, the major products are <sup2</supHOC + <sup2</supH and <sup2</supHCO + <sup2</supH. In general, the findings approve the occurrence of the title reaction and indicate that the mentioned conflict is due to the sensitivity of the reaction to the investigated temperature and <iJ</i level.

This leads to well-defined mathematical requirements for classification of a dynamical process as a reaction mechanism and also to a straightforward mathematical procedure for the determination of a special class of independent collision mechanisms that are dubbed \"canonical\". Canonical mechanisms result from an exact decomposition of the differential cross section of the reaction and form a complete orthogonal basis in terms of which all reaction mechanisms can be described. Examples involving the benchmark F + H2 and D + H2 reactions at energies ranging from ultralow to hyperthermal illustrate how canonical and other reaction mechanisms can be visualised and also how analysis of a reaction in terms of its canonical mechanisms can provide insight into its dynamics.",

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

According to a recent paper reported by Hasson et al., [J. Phys. Chem., 2004, 108, 5979-5989] this reaction may proceed by three different channels: CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (1a); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OH + O(3) (1b); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)O + OH + O(2) (1c). In experiments, CH(3)C(O)O(2) and HO(2) radicals were generated using Cl-initiated oxidation of acetaldehyde and methanol, respectively, in the presence of oxygen. The addition of amounts of benzene in the system, forming hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals in the presence of OH, allowed us to answer that channel (1c) is &lt;10%. The rate constant k(1) of reaction (1) has been finally measured at (1.50 +/- 0.08) x 10(-11) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) at 298 K, after having considered the combination of all the possible values for the branching ratios k(1a)/k(1,)k(1b)/k(1,)k(1c)/k(1) and has been compared to previous measurements. The branching ratio k(1b)/k(1), determined by measuring ozone in situ, was found to be equal to (20 +/- 1)%, a value consistent with the previous values reported in the literature. DFT calculations show that channel (1c) is also of minor importance: it was deduced unambiguously that the formation of CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)(g)) is the dominant product channel, followed by the second channel (1b) leading to CH(3)C(O)OH and singlet O(3) and, much less importantly, channel (1c) which corresponds to OH formation. These conclusions give a reliable explanation of the experimental observations of this work. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that the CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2) is still predominantly a radical chain termination reaction in the tropospheric ozone chain formation processes.",

N(2)O and HNO(2) are attributed to decomposition of the initial product HNO. Kinetic studies yield the rate law d[P]/dt = -k(2nd)( )(order)[HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][*NO]; k(2nd)( )(order) = 0.14 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C, with DeltaH() = 11.7 +/- 1.5 kcal/mol and DeltaS() = -16.3 +/- 3.5 cal/(mol deg). The rate of reaction is not inhibited by CO. The kinetic isotope effect for reaction of D-Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) is k(H)/k(D) = 1.7. These observations are consistent with a first step involving direct H (D) atom transfer from the metal hydride to *NO, forming HNO. Also supporting this mechanism is the approximately 150-times slower reaction of H-Mo(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and failure to observe reaction for H-W(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) in keeping with metal-hydrogen bond strengths Cr &lt; Mo &lt; W. Reaction of PhS-Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) with NO at 1-2 atm pressure in toluene solution also forms Cr(NO)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) as the sole metal-containing product. The initial product is the unstable nitrosothiol PhS-NO.

The rate of reaction is independent of both NO and CO pressure. The transition state in the first-order process is proposed to involve migration of bound thiolate to coordinated CO, forming Cr(CO)(2) (eta(2)-C(=O)SPh)C(5)Me(5). The enthalpy of reaction of *Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and NO yielding Cr(NO)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) and CO has been measured by solution calorimetry: DeltaH degrees = -33.2 +/- 1.8 kcal/mol. The Cr-NO bond strength is estimated as approximately 70 kcal/mol and provides the net thermodynamic driving force for the proposed elimination of the unstable molecules HNO and PhSNO.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

The geometric parameters of the reactants, products, and transition states are optimized by both UMPW1PW91 and unrestricted coupled-cluster single and double excitation (UCCSD) methods with the 6-311+G(3df) basis set. The potential energy surface has been further refined (with triple excitations, T) at the UCCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df) level of theory. The results show that Cl(2) and O ((3)P) can be produced by chlorine atom abstraction via a tight transition state, while ClOCl ((1)A(1)) and ClClO ((1)A') can be formed by barrierless association processes with exothermicities of 31.8 and 16.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In principle the O ((1)D) atom can be generated with a large endothermicity of 56.9 kcal/mol; on the other hand, its barrierless reaction with Cl(2) can readily form ClClO ((1)A'), which fragments rapidly to give ClO + Cl. The rate constants of both forward and reverse processes have been predicted at 150-2000 K by the microcanonical variational transition state theory (VTST)/Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory. The predicted rate constants are in good agreement with available experimental data within reported errors.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)]. In this work, a historical but contemporary perspective of the discoveries and innovations of the two reactions is given. From a bird's eye view and in a more general sense, the discovery of novel reactions is discussed and how it relates to inventions and innovations.",

This maintenance of a dynamic state focuses on conditions where the objects are thermodynamically not very stable and should be rare or virtually inexistent. It does not matter whether they are homochirally enriched populations of chiral molecules, a specific composition of some sort of aggregate, supramolecules, or even a set of chemically relatively unstable molecules that constantly transform one into another. What does matter is that these specific interactions prevail in complex mixtures and eventually grow in numbers and frequency through the enhancing action of autocatalysis, which makes such systems ultimately resemble living cells and interacting living populations. Such chemical systems need to be correctly understood, but also intuitively described. They may be so complex that metaphors become practically more important, as a means of communication, than the precise and correct technical description of chemical models and complex molecular or supramolecular relations. This puts systems chemists on a tightrope walk of science communication, between the complex reality and an imaginative model world. This essay addresses, both, scientists who would like to read \"A Brief History of Systems Chemistry\", that is, about its \"essence\", and systems chemists who work with and communicate complex life-like chemical systems. I illustrate for the external reader a light mantra, that I call \"to make more of it\", and I charily draw systems chemists to reflect upon the fact that chemists are not always good at drawing a clear line between a model and \"the reality\": The real thing. We are in a constant danger of taking metaphors for real. Yet in real life, we do know very well that we cannot smoke with Magritte's pipe, don't we?",

It is therefore often called the arrow of time. Less often discussed but just as important is the effect of kinetic barriers which intercept equilibration and preserve highly ordered, high energy non-equilibrium states. Examples of such states are many modern materials produced intentionally for technological applications. Furthermore, all living organisms fuelled directly by photosynthesis and those fuelled indirectly by living on high energy nutrition represent preserved non-equilibrium states. The formation of these states represents the local reversal of the arrow of time which only seemingly violates the second law. It has been known since the seminal work of Prigogine that the stabilisation of these states inevitably requires the dissipation of energy in the form of waste heat. It is this feature of waste heat dissipation following the input of energy that drives all processes occurring at a non-zero rate. Photosynthesis, replication of living organisms, self-assembly, crystal shape engineering and distillation have this principle in common with the well-known Carnot cycle in the heat engine. Drawing on this analogy, we subsume these essential and often sophisticated driven processes under the term machinery of life. ",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

We closely follow the formation and evolution of the pivotal C-C, C-O, C[double bond, length as m-dash]O, and C-N bonds, which dictate the chemistry of the molecules of life. In many cases, formation of these bonds is set in motion by proton transfers in which individual water molecules act as catalysts so that water atoms end up in the products. Our results indicate that the prebiotic formation of carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, formic acid, formaldimine, glycolaldehyde, glycine, glycolonitrile, and oxazole derivatives, among others, are best described as highly nonsynchronous concerted single step processes. Nonetheless, for all reactions involving double proton transfer, the formation and breaking of O-H bonds around a particular O atom occur in a synchronous fashion, apparently independently from other primitive processes. For the most part, the first process to initiate seems to be the double proton transfer in the reactions where they are present, then bond breaking/formation around the reactive carbon in the carbonyl group and finally rupture of the C-N bonds in the appropriate cases, which are the most reluctant to break.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

The origins of this effect were explored by varying the order in which MgCl(2) was added to a series of DNA condensation reactions with hexammine cobalt chloride. The interplay between Mg(II), temperature, and absolute cation concentration on DNA condensation was also investigated. These studies reveal that DNA condensation is extremely sensitive to whether Mg(II) is associated with DNA prior to condensation or Mg(II) is added concurrently with hexammine cobalt(III) at the time of condensation. It was also found that, in the presence of Mg(II), temperature and dilution can have opposite effects on the degree of DNA condensation. A systematic comparison of DNA condensates observed in this study clearly illustrates that, under our low-salt conditions, toroid size is determined by the kinetics of toroid nucleation and growth. However, when Mg(II) is present during condensation, toroid size can also be limited by a thermodynamic parameter (e.g., undercharging). The path dependence of DNA condensation presented here illustrates that regardless of which particular factors limit toroid growth, toroids formed under the various conditions of this study are largely nonequilibrium structures.",

Lewis has defined the quantum unit, the \"electron pair bond,\" for construction of a chemical universe, and in so doing he charted a vast chemical territory and affected most profoundly the mental map of chemistry for generations ahead. Nevertheless, not all is known about the chemical bond\" the chemical territory is still teaming with new and exciting problems of in new materials, nanoparticles, quantum dots, metalloenzymes, bonding at surface-vapor interfaces, and so on and so forth.",

The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Despite this, his contributions have often been overshadowed by those of Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, who also played critical roles in preparing the gas and understanding its nature. Sadly, Scheele was slow to publish his discovery and therefore Priestley is rightly recognized as the first person to report the preparation of oxygen. This being said, the thinking of both Scheele and Priestley was dominated by the phlogiston theory, and it was left to Lavoisier to elucidate the true nature of oxygen. In addition to his work on oxygen, Scheele was enormously productive in other areas of chemistry. Arguably he discovered seven new elements and many other compounds. However, he kept a low profile during his life as a pharmacist, and he did not have strong links with contemporary prestigious institutions such as the Royal Society in England or the French Académie des Sciences. He was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Science but only attended one meeting. Partly as a result, he remains a somewhat nebulous figure despite the critical contribution he made to the history of respiratory gases and his extensive researches in other areas of chemistry.

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies.

Melting and boiling points as characteristic values emerge from this study as products of laboratory standardization, developed by chemists in their struggle to classify, understand and control organic nature. A major argument here concerns the role played by the introduction of organic synthesis in driving these changes. Synthetic organic chemistry vastly increased the number of known organic substances, precipitating the chemical identity crisis of my title. Successful natural product synthesis, moreover, depended on chemists' ability to demonstrate the absolute identity of synthetic product and natural target--something late nineteenth-century chemists eventually achieved by making reliable, replicable melting and boiling point measurements. In the period before the establishment of national standards laboratories, chemists and scientific glassblowers worked together to standardize melting and boiling points as physical constants, such collaborations highlighting the essential importance of chemical glassware and glassblowing skill in the development of nineteenth-century organic chemistry.",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO. At a temperature of 50 degrees C under 1 atm of CO the net reaction 4(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + H(2)S --&gt; 2HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO occurs within minutes without formation of detectable amounts of HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5).",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

[HC≡CLiCl](-) reacts with water more rapidly than [HC≡CMgCl2](-), consistent with the higher reactivity of organolithium versus organomagnesium reagents. Addition of LiCl to [HC≡CLiCl](-) or [HC≡CMgCl2](-) enhances their reactivity towards water by a factor of about 2, while addition of MgCl2 to [HC≡CMgCl2](-) enhances its reactivity by a factor of about 4. Ab initio calculations coupled with master equation/RRKM theory kinetic modeling show that these reactions proceed via a mechanism involving formation of a water adduct followed by rearrangement, proton transfer, and acetylene elimination as either discrete or concerted steps. Both the energy and entropy requirements for these elementary steps need to be considered in order to explain the observed kinetics.",

Our attempts to generate and detect diazirinone (1) in either the condensed phase (using matrix isolation spectroscopy) or in the gas phase (using millimeter-wave rotational spectroscopy), however, have been unsuccessful. Trapping the volatile products produced from the reaction of 3-chloro-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)diazirine (5) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) under matrix-isolation conditions affords chlorofluorodiazirine (8) and carbon monoxide but fails to provide evidence for diazirinone (1).

This discrepancy lies well outside any expected solvent shift or calculation error at this level of theory. In an effort to reconcile our findings with the earlier reports concerning diazirinone (1), we reconsidered the infrared spectral evidence upon which the original claim of diazirinone synthesis was based.

Despite the charge difference, the barrier heights and the geometrical requirements upon going from the reactant to the transition structure are surprisingly similar for X- and XH. The barrier heights decrease on going from left to right in the periodic table, and increasing ionization energy (of X- and XH) is correlated with decreasing barrier. The observed trends are explained in terms of substrates with stronger electrostatic character giving rise to lower energetic barriers due to decreased electron repulsion in the transition structure. On the basis of this study, the relationship between the kinetic concept of nucleophilicity and the thermodynamic concept of basicity has been analyzed and clarified. Since the trends in intrinsic nucleophilicity (only defined for identity reactions) and basicity are opposite, overall nucleophilicity (defined for any reaction) will be determined by the relative contribution of the two factors.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The corresponding ClO(4)(-) compound (4a) is isotypic. Crystal data: C(15.5)H(31)Cl(2)Mo(3)N(3)O(4)S(13), orthorhombic space group Aba2, a = 25.816(5) Å, b = 17.761(4) Å, c = 16.250(3) Å, Z = 8. For 1a, 4a, 6, and the previously analyzed 2 and 3 the crystal structures revealed characteristic interactions between the anions X and the three axial (out-of-plane) sulfur atoms S(ax) of the disulfido bridges. The Raman data showed a significant decrease of the S(eq)-S(ax) stretch resonance frequency in the order 4, 5, 6 &gt; 1 &gt; 3. This decrease is paralleled with a slight increase of the S(eq)-S(ax) bond length and with a significant shortening of the X.S(ax) distances when compared to the sum of the corresponding van der Waals radii. A comprehensive quantum chemical study, using both density functional theory and semiempirical calculations, revealed that for hard counterions such as NO(3)(-) and ClO(4)(-) the S(ax).X interactions can be understood in terms of an almost entirely electrostatic interaction, whereas for soft nucleophiles such as I(-) and S(2)(-) significant covalency is observed. In addition, the general reaction of [Mo(3)S(7)](4+) complexes with a nucleophile was modeled. With regard to the side-on bonding of the &amp;mgr;-S(2) groups to Mo, the calculations indicated a significantly higher bond energy for the axial (out-of-plane) sulfur atoms, explaining the much higher lability of the sulfur atoms in the equatorial (in-plane) position.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous. (We speculate that for a nonconcerted process this maximum is actually positive.) Thus, κ(R) can serve as an indicator of the level of nonsynchronicity.",

Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, considered by many to be the father of TST, never resolved the question as to the definition of the activation energy for which Arrhenius became famous. In 1978, Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 2959 (1978)] finally showed that especially when considering condensed phases, the activation energy is a free energy, it is the barrier height in the potential of mean force felt by the reacting system. Parallel to the development of rate theory in the chemistry community, Kramers published in 1940 [Physica (Amsterdam) 7, 284 (1940)] a seminal paper on the relation between Einstein's theory of Brownian motion [Einstein, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)] and rate theory. Kramers' paper provided a solution for the effect of friction on reaction rates but left us also with some challenges. He could not derive a uniform expression for the rate, valid for all values of the friction coefficient, known as the Kramers turnover problem. He also did not establish the connection between his approach and the TST developed by the chemistry community. For many years, Kramers' theory was considered as providing a dynamic correction to the thermodynamic TST. Both of these questions were resolved in the 1980s when Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 85, 865 (1986)] showed that Kramers' expression in the moderate to strong friction regime could be derived from TST, provided that the bath, which is the source of the friction, is handled at the same level as the system which is observed. This then led to the Mel'nikov-Pollak-Grabert-Hanggi [Mel'nikov and Meshkov, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1018 (1986); Pollak, Grabert, and Hanggi, ibid. 91, 4073 (1989)] solution of the turnover problem posed by Kramers. Although classical rate theory reached a high level of maturity, its quantum analog leaves the theorist with serious challenges to this very day. As noted by Wigner [Trans. Faraday Soc. 34, 29 (1938)], TST is an inherently classical theory. A definite quantum TST has not been formulated to date although some very useful approximate quantum rate theories have been invented. The successes and challenges facing quantum rate theory are outlined. An open problem which is being investigated intensively is rate theory away from equilibrium. TST is no longer valid and cannot even serve as a conceptual guide for understanding the critical factors which determine rates away from equilibrium. The nonequilibrium quantum theory is even less well developed than the classical, and suffers from the fact that even today, we do not know how to solve the real time quantum dynamics for systems with \"many\" degrees of freedom.",

These steps form a scheme of independent reactions that can provide a rational basis for elucidating the reaction mechanism (network) while reducing both the component and parametric dimensionality of the description of kinetics. Several particular reaction examples are used to explain the method and show that rates of additional, dependent reactions cannot be unambiguously related to measured component rates.

It does not matter whether they are homochirally enriched populations of chiral molecules, a specific composition of some sort of aggregate, supramolecules, or even a set of chemically relatively unstable molecules that constantly transform one into another. What does matter is that these specific interactions prevail in complex mixtures and eventually grow in numbers and frequency through the enhancing action of autocatalysis, which makes such systems ultimately resemble living cells and interacting living populations. Such chemical systems need to be correctly understood, but also intuitively described. They may be so complex that metaphors become practically more important, as a means of communication, than the precise and correct technical description of chemical models and complex molecular or supramolecular relations.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality.

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)]. In this work, a historical but contemporary perspective of the discoveries and innovations of the two reactions is given. From a bird's eye view and in a more general sense, the discovery of novel reactions is discussed and how it relates to inventions and innovations.",

A quantitative evaluation of binding affinities relies on the determination of binding constants but, whilst the binding constant fully defines the affinity of a reagent for a ligand when only one complex species is formed, the same is not true when the interacting partners form more than one complex of different stoichiometry, because all complexes contribute to the overall binding affinity. Unfortunately, this situation is the rule rather than the exception in chemical systems, but a generally accepted solution for this issue has not yet been settled. In this Personal Account, we describe the evolution, from the initial idea to a fully developed stage, of a binding descriptor that has been developed with the aim of filling this gap, thereby providing scientists in all fields of chemistry with a unifying tool for the assessment of binding affinities based on the knowledge of the binding constants in systems that involve any number of complex species.",

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

Four examples of practical application were provided, including the computation of the point of application of a force and the angular velocity of a rigid body.

However, with quantum mechanics assigning probabilities to such objects, it is often desirable to work with the notion of a \"total\" that takes into account their varied relevance. For example, such an effective count of position states available to a lattice electron could characterize its localization properties. Similarly, the effective total of outcomes in the measurement step of a quantum computation relates to the efficiency of the quantum algorithm. Despite a broad need for effective counting, a well-founded prescription has not been formulated. Instead, the assignments that do not respect the measure-like nature of the concept, such as versions of the participation number or exponentiated entropies, are used in some areas. Here, we develop the additive theory of effective number functions (ENFs), namely functions assigning consistent totals to collections of objects endowed with probability weights. Our analysis reveals the existence of a minimal total, realized by the unique ENF, which leads to effective counting with absolute meaning. Touching upon the nature of the measure, our results may find applications not only in quantum physics, but also in other quantitative sciences.",

The 2,3- and 1,2-ClF interchange reactions compete with 2,3-ClH and 2,3-FH elimination reactions. The total unimolecular rate constant for CF(2)ClCF(2)CH(2)Cl is 0.54 +/- 0.15 x 10(4) s(-1) with branching fractions for 1,2-ClF interchange of 0.03 and 0.97 for 2,3-FH elimination. The total rate constant for CF(2)ClCFClCH(2)F is 1.35 +/- 0.39 x 10(4) s(-1) with branching fractions of 0.20 for 2,3-ClF interchange, 0.71 for 2,3-ClH elimination and 0.09 for 2,3-FH elimination; the products from 1,2-ClF interchange could be observed, but the rate constant was too small to be measured.

Density functional theory was used to assign vibrational frequencies and moments of inertia for the molecules and their transition states. These results were combined with statistical unimolecular reaction theory to assign threshold energies from the experimental rate constants for ClF interchange, ClH elimination and FH elimination. These assignments are compared with results from previous chemical activation experiments with CF(3)CFClCH(2)Cl, CF(3)CF(2)CH(3,) CF(3)CFClCH(3) and CF(2)ClCF(2)CH(3).",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

This maintenance of a dynamic state focuses on conditions where the objects are thermodynamically not very stable and should be rare or virtually inexistent. It does not matter whether they are homochirally enriched populations of chiral molecules, a specific composition of some sort of aggregate, supramolecules, or even a set of chemically relatively unstable molecules that constantly transform one into another. What does matter is that these specific interactions prevail in complex mixtures and eventually grow in numbers and frequency through the enhancing action of autocatalysis, which makes such systems ultimately resemble living cells and interacting living populations. Such chemical systems need to be correctly understood, but also intuitively described. They may be so complex that metaphors become practically more important, as a means of communication, than the precise and correct technical description of chemical models and complex molecular or supramolecular relations. This puts systems chemists on a tightrope walk of science communication, between the complex reality and an imaginative model world. This essay addresses, both, scientists who would like to read \"A Brief History of Systems Chemistry\", that is, about its \"essence\", and systems chemists who work with and communicate complex life-like chemical systems. I illustrate for the external reader a light mantra, that I call \"to make more of it\", and I charily draw systems chemists to reflect upon the fact that chemists are not always good at drawing a clear line between a model and \"the reality\": The real thing. We are in a constant danger of taking metaphors for real. Yet in real life, we do know very well that we cannot smoke with Magritte's pipe, don't we?",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

Here, we derive a theory for chemical reactions in coexisting phases at phase equilibrium. We show that phase equilibrium couples the rates of chemical reactions of components with their diffusive exchanges between the phases. Strikingly, the chemical relaxation kinetics can be represented as a flow along the phase equilibrium line in the phase diagram. A key finding of our theory is that differences in reaction rates between coexisting phases stem solely from phase-dependent reaction rate coefficients.

This paper explores one of the mathematical, rather than physicochemical, explanations for the compensation effect and for the isokinetic relationship. It is demonstrated, both theoretically and by numerical simulations, that random errors in kinetic data generate an apparent compensation effect (sometimes termed the statistical compensation effect) when the true Arrhenius parameters are constant. Expressions for the gradient of data points on a plot of ln A against E are derived when experimental kinetic data are analysed by linear regression, by non-linear regression and by weighted linear regression. It is shown that the most appropriate analysis technique depends critically on the error structure of the kinetic data. Whenever data points on a plot of ln A against E are in a straight line with a gradient close to 1/RT, then confidence ellipses should be calculated for each data point to investigate whether the apparent compensation effect arises from random errors in the kinetic measurements or has some other origin.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Jean Jacques and others have argued that Berthelot's shift can be seen as a result of his flawed understanding of the emerging atomistically based theories of structural chemistry; a sense that he was being left behind by this field, it is maintained, led him to try something different. In contrast, I will argue that thermochemistry was a logical progression of Berthelot's overarching desire to predict chemical action, a great challenge in the middle of the nineteenth century. Berthelot hoped and expected that synthesis and chemical industry would transform the conditions of our existence. He asked such questions as: What substances can we expect to create? From which reagents? And most important: how can we tell in advance whether a particular chemical reaction will occur?",

In the early days of this field, its sole emphasis focused on debunking the concept of vitalism, that living organisms could create forms of matter accessible only to them. Emphasis then turned to the use of synthesis to degrade and reconstitute natural products to establish structure and answer questions about biosynthesis. It then evolved to not only an intricate science but also a celebrated form of art. As the field progressed, a more orderly and logical approach emerged that served to standardize the process. These developments even opened up the possibility of computer-aided design using retrosynthetic analysis. Finally, the elevation of this field to even higher levels of sophistication showed that it was feasible to synthesize any natural product, regardless of complexity, in a laboratory. During this remarkable evolution, as has been reviewed elsewhere, many of the principles and methods of organic synthesis were refined and galvanized. In the modern era, students and practitioners are still magnetically attracted to this field due to the excitement of the journey, the exhilaration of creation, and the opportunity to invent solutions to challenges that still persist. Contemporary total synthesis is less concerned with demonstrating a proof of concept or a feasible approach but rather aims for increased efficiency, scalability, and even \"ideality.\" In general, the molecules of Nature are created biosynthetically with levels of practicality that are still unimaginable using the tools of modern synthesis. Thus, as the community strives to do more with less (i.e., innovation), total synthesis is now focused on a pursuit for simplicity rather than a competition for maximal complexity. In doing so, the practitioner must devise outside-the-box strategies supplemented with forgotten or newly invented methods to reduce step count and increase the overall economy of the approach. The downstream applications of this pursuit not only empower students who often go on to apply these skills in the private sector but also lead to new discoveries that can impact numerous disciplines of societal importance. This account traces some select case studies from our laboratory over the past five years that vividly demonstrate our own motivation for dedicating so much effort to this classic field. In aiming for simplicity, we focus on the elusive goal of achieving ideality, a term that, when taken in the proper context, can serve as a guiding light to point the way to furthering progress in organic synthesis.",

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions.

This Accounts of Chemical Research thematic issue on \"Synthesis, Design, and Molecular Function\" is intended to provide further perspective now from well into the 21st century. Much has happened in the past few decades. The targets, methods, strategies, reagents, procedures, goals, funding, practices, and practitioners of synthesis have changed, some in dramatic ways as documented in impressive contributions to this issue. However, a constant for most synthesis studies continues to be the goal of achieving function with synthetic economy. Whether in the form of new catalysts, reagents, therapeutic leads, diagnostics, drug delivery systems, imaging agents, sensors, materials, energy generation and storage systems, bioremediation strategies, or molecules that challenge old theories or test new ones, the function of a target has been and continues to be a major and compelling justification for its synthesis. While the targets of synthesis have historically been heavily represented by natural products, increasingly design, often inspired by natural structures, is providing a new source of target structures exhibiting new or natural functions and new or natural synthetic challenges. Complementing isolation and screening approaches to new target identification, design enables one to create targets de novo with an emphasis on sought-after function and synthetic innovation with step-economy. Design provides choice. It allows one to determine how close a synthesis will come to the ideal synthesis and how close a structure will come to the ideal function. In this Account, we address studies in our laboratory on function-oriented synthesis (FOS), a strategy to achieve function by design and with synthetic economy. By starting with function rather than structure, FOS places an initial emphasis on target design, thereby harnessing the power of chemists and computers to create new structures with desired functions that could be prepared in a simple, safe, economical, and green, if not ideal, fashion. Reported herein are examples of FOS associated with (a) molecular recognition, leading to the first designed phorbol-inspired protein kinase C regulatory ligands, the first designed bryostatin analogs, the newest bryologs, and a new family of designed kinase inhibitors, (b) target modification, leading to highly simplified but functionally competent photonucleases-molecules that cleave DNA upon photoactivation, (c) drug delivery, leading to cell penetrating molecular transporters, molecules that ferry other attached or complexed molecules across biological barriers, and (d) new reactivity-regenerating reagents in the form of functional equivalents of butatrienes, reagents that allow for back-to-back three-component cycloaddition reactions, thus achieving structural complexity and value with step-economy. While retrosynthetic analysis seeks to identify the best way to make a target, retrofunction analysis seeks to identify the best targets to make. In essence, form (structure) follows function. ",

At the end of the day, he or she will be judged by the artistry of the final work and the weight of the gold discovered in the process.

The measure satisfies three desired properties-causality, specificity, intrinsicality-and is shown to be unique. Causality means that symbols must be transmitted with probability greater than chance. Specificity means that information must be transmitted by an individual symbol. Intrinsicality means that a symbol must be taken as such and cannot be decomposed into signal and noise. It follows that the intrinsic information carried by a specific symbol increases if the repertoire of symbols increases without noise (expansion) and decreases if it does so without signal (dilution). An optimal balance between expansion and dilution is relevant for systems whose elements must assess their inputs and outputs from the intrinsic perspective, such as neurons in a network.",

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

In this paper we explore the mathematical characteristics of the Fukui potential and demonstrate its relationship to the hardness and the ability of an atom in a molecule to change its charge. The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness. The strong correlation between the hardness and the Fukui potential at the nucleus suggests that the Fukui potential at the nucleus is an alternative definition for the chemical hardness.",

Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality.

We first bring basic concepts related to electronic hardness, and then we present an overview of important manifestations of the GMHP for molecular systems such as (i) the tendency of two free radicals to couple, (ii) reduced reactivity of noble gases, (iii) symmetry-breaking distortions related to the Jahn-Teller effect, and/or these connected with (anti)aromatic character of certain organic molecules, (iv) enhanced reactivity of excited states, (v) high-low spin transitions, etc. GMHP is an important qualitative indicator in studies of molecular isomerism and reactivity.

Furthermore, we show that it implies Pearson's hard/soft acid/base principle mathematically and confirm this result with numerical examples.

This indicator was proposed to be especially useful for reactants with multiple reactive sites, especially if the nature of the reactivity at those sites was different. This suggests that this reactivity indicator is especially appropriate for ambidentate molecules; this paper confirms this hypothesis. The general-purpose reactivity indicator not only identifies the most reactive sites, it also identifies which substrates prefer which reactive sites. In particular, the reactivity indicator allows one to clearly distinguish which sites of an ambidentate molecule are most reactive when electron transfer from the attacking reagent is large (a soft reagent) and which sites are most reactive when the attacking reagent is hard and highly charged (so that electron transfer is relatively insignificant). To illustrate the efficacy of the indicator for nucleophiles we consider SCN(-), SeCN(-), NO(2)(-), SO(3)(2-).

Since the development of the chemical industry in the nineteenth century, chemistry has contributed to the deterioration of the environment but has also helped to reduce pollution. Finally, we discuss the role of codes of ethics and whether the current codes of conduct for chemists are adequate for the challenges of today's world. ",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Here, we document the Transitivity code, written in Python, a free open-source code compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS platforms. Procedures are made available to evaluate the phenomenology of the temperature dependence of rate constants for processes from the Arrhenius and Transitivity plots. Reaction rate constants can be calculated by the traditional Transition-State Theory using a set of one-dimensional tunneling corrections (Bell (1935), Bell (1958), Skodje and Truhlar and, in particular, the deformed ( d -TST) approach). To account for the solvent effect on reaction rate constant, implementation is given of the Kramers and of Collins-Kimball formulations. An input file generator is provided to run various molecular dynamics approaches in CPMD code. Examples are worked out and made available for testing. The novelty of this code is its general scope and particular exploit of d <i-</iformulations to cope with non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures, a topic which is the focus of recent intense investigations. We expect that this code serves as a quick and practical tool for data documentation from electronic structure calculations: It presents a very intuitive graphical interface which we believe to provide an excellent working tool for researchers and as courseware to teach statistical thermodynamics, thermochemistry, kinetics, and related areas.",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness. The strong correlation between the hardness and the Fukui potential at the nucleus suggests that the Fukui potential at the nucleus is an alternative definition for the chemical hardness.",

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

We show that the concept of the electron pair bond has endured to the present day and is now understood to be a consequence of the Pauli principle. In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory. The electron density distribution in a molecule can now be analyzed using the ELF and other functions of the electron density to show where electron pairs are most probably to be found in a molecule.",

The minima and maxima of F(R) provide a natural division of the process into several regions. Those in which F(R) is increasing are where the most dramatic changes in electronic properties take place, and where the system goes from activated reactants (at the force minimum) to activated products (at the force maximum). Kappa(R) is negative throughout such a region. We summarize evidence supporting the idea that a reaction should be viewed as going through a transition region rather than through a single point transition state. A similar conclusion has come out of transition state spectroscopy. We describe this region as a chemically-active, or electronically-intensive, stage of the reaction, while the ones that precede and follow it are structurally-intensive.

Even more inexplicably, nature uncovered those laws twice-once unconsciously, once consciously.

What is the law of nature that enabled nature to discover its own laws?

The current definition of the mole shows a certain ambiguity regarding the nature of the quantity \"amount of substance\". The proposed new definition removes the ambiguity, but at a cost: it becomes difficult to justify treating amount of substance as having its own dimension, and hence its own unit, the mole. I argue that the difficulties with amount of substance result from its role as a mediator between macroscopic and microscopic scales. To understand why amount of substance might have its own dimension, we need to connect amount of substance to mass, contra current proposals to separate them.",

This physiological control analysis can most usefully be applied to substances with fluxes into and out of organs that are uniquely dependent only on their plasma concentrations. The organ flux of a substance is defined as the steady-state net flux of a substance into a particular organ. The organ flux control coefficients quantify the extent to which a particular organ controls the flux of a substance into the same or another particular organ. Organ concentration control coefficients quantify the extent to which an organ controls the steady-state concentration of a substance in the blood. The control coefficients are additive and obey summation, connectivity and branching theorems. Thus the control coefficients can be determined experimentally by measuring the sensitivities (elasticities) of organ fluxes to the plasma concentration of the substance. As an example of the application of these concepts, the control of ketone-body metabolism in vivo is analysed using data from the literature.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Possible mechanisms were classified according to four pathways yielding products in the following four possible groups: N2O/N2S + CN, N2 + NCO/NCS, N2 + CNO/CNS, and CNN + NO/NS, labeled in order from p1/p1s to p4/p4s. The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts.

The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness.

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO. At a temperature of 50 degrees C under 1 atm of CO the net reaction 4(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + H(2)S --&gt; 2HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO occurs within minutes without formation of detectable amounts of HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5).",

In contrast, I will argue that thermochemistry was a logical progression of Berthelot's overarching desire to predict chemical action, a great challenge in the middle of the nineteenth century. Berthelot hoped and expected that synthesis and chemical industry would transform the conditions of our existence. He asked such questions as: What substances can we expect to create? From which reagents? And most important: how can we tell in advance whether a particular chemical reaction will occur?",

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

A third Guareschi reaction, the so-called \"Guareschi 1897 reaction\", is one of the most unusual reactions in organic chemistry, involving the radical-mediated paradoxical aerobic generation of hydrocarbons in near-neutral water solution. A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

However, having him listed among the authors of two name reactions, known as Norrish Type I and Type II, plus a subcase of the latter that is the Yang cyclization, is not coherent. Indeed, Norrish had no interest in organic synthesis, while this is a required feature of name reactions. And, at any rate, Professors Ciamician and Paternò had arrived at the same conclusions with the same compounds much earlier, except for the measurement of quantum yields. Things are too long away now for introducing any change, but one should remember that using Norrish name here is a mistake, while it would be appropriate to add the name of Ciamician for a different name reaction, the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of alkenes and conjugated carbonyls.

Our attempts to generate and detect diazirinone (1) in either the condensed phase (using matrix isolation spectroscopy) or in the gas phase (using millimeter-wave rotational spectroscopy), however, have been unsuccessful. Trapping the volatile products produced from the reaction of 3-chloro-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)diazirine (5) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) under matrix-isolation conditions affords chlorofluorodiazirine (8) and carbon monoxide but fails to provide evidence for diazirinone (1). Moreover, sophisticated ab initio calculations of the structure and fundamental vibrational frequencies of diazirinone (1) produce an estimate for the fundamental band origin of the C=O stretch (2046 cm(-1)) that is ca. 100 cm(-1) lower in frequency than the experimental value previously attributed to this band. This discrepancy lies well outside any expected solvent shift or calculation error at this level of theory. In an effort to reconcile our findings with the earlier reports concerning diazirinone (1), we reconsidered the infrared spectral evidence upon which the original claim of diazirinone synthesis was based. New experiments demonstrate that these spectra may be explained and reproduced with a combination of solution-phase and gas-phase absorptions of CO, without recourse to invoke diazirinone (1).",

His synthetic and mechanistic studies have contributed to areas including non-benzenoid aromatics, carbenes, pericyclic reactions, and diradical intermediates. Doering's synthesis with L. H. Knox of the highly stable tropylium ion and their investigation of its reactivity were the starting point for the development of the field of non-benzenoid aromatics. Working with A. K. Hoffmann, Doering demonstrated the synthesis of dichloro- and dibromocarbene by base-induced alpha elimination of HCl or HBr from CHCl3 or CHBr3 under anhydrous conditions. These results allowed for the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and derivatives including allenes. Using 14C labeling experiments, Doering and Prinzbach showed that the mechanism of insertion of singlet methylene into a C-H bond was a concerted process.In their work on the Cope rearrangement, Doering and Roth's outstanding stereochemical analysis showed that the rearrangement of acyclic 1,5-hexadienes proceeds concertedly, passing over a chairlike transition state. This work has had an enormous impact on the understanding of stereochemical control in synthetic organic chemistry, and many fruitful applications in synthesis have stemmed directly from this finding. Transition-state resonance structures analogous to those for ground-state aromatics can qualitatively explain the relatively large substituent effects on the rate of the Cope rearrangement. However, quantum chemical calculations have quantitatively described these effects. The rapid degenerate Cope rearrangements in the cis-divinylcyclopropane units of 3,4-homotropilidene, barbaralone, and bullvalene establish these molecules as having fluxional structures. The unique molecule bullvalene has more than 1.2 million possible structures interconnected by degenerate Cope rearrangements, which average all H and all C atoms. Doering has also examined stepwise thermal reorganizations that pass through intermediary 1,3- or 1,4-diradicals and do not show conformational equilibration as would be expected for classical intermediates. Doering calls these processes \"not-obviously concerted\". He discusses \"continuous diradicals\" as transition states and rationalizes the course of these reactions through the concept of a \"caldera\" (a flat surface with small energy wells as found on the top of volcanoes).The understanding of fundamental chemical reactions remains the focus of Doering's research. In his terms, \"understanding\" means not only gaining deep insight but also the intellectual control that allows researchers to predict a reaction's course. Because the interplay between theory and experiment has led to great progress in this predictive ability, Doering's experimental work has provided an important input for computational chemistry and to the essential understanding of chemical reactions.",

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4. In this case, computational results support electrochemical data in backing a direct electron transfer reaction.",

It was shown that the gas-phase reaction of W with CO2 proceeds with a negligible barrier via an insertion pathway, W(7S)+CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta2-OCO)(6A')--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)(1A)--&gt;WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma). This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center. The overall reaction W+(6D) + CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta1-OCO)+(6A)--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)+(4A)--&gt;WO+(4Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma) is calculated to be exothermic by 25.4 kcal/mol.

Intermediate W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) is 20.0 kcal/mol less stable than OW(eta1-CO)+(4A), and separated from the latter by a 35.2 kcal/mol barrier. Complex W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) is characterized as an ion-molecular complex type of W+-(CO2).

Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol.

According to a recent paper reported by Hasson et al., [J. Phys. Chem., 2004, 108, 5979-5989] this reaction may proceed by three different channels: CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (1a); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OH + O(3) (1b); CH(3)C(O)O(2)+ HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)O + OH + O(2) (1c). In experiments, CH(3)C(O)O(2) and HO(2) radicals were generated using Cl-initiated oxidation of acetaldehyde and methanol, respectively, in the presence of oxygen. The addition of amounts of benzene in the system, forming hydroxycyclohexadienyl radicals in the presence of OH, allowed us to answer that channel (1c) is &lt;10%.

The branching ratio k(1b)/k(1), determined by measuring ozone in situ, was found to be equal to (20 +/- 1)%, a value consistent with the previous values reported in the literature. DFT calculations show that channel (1c) is also of minor importance: it was deduced unambiguously that the formation of CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2) (X (3)Sigma(-)(g)) is the dominant product channel, followed by the second channel (1b) leading to CH(3)C(O)OH and singlet O(3) and, much less importantly, channel (1c) which corresponds to OH formation. These conclusions give a reliable explanation of the experimental observations of this work.

The present work analyses the kinetics of this reaction theoretically, both to explain this unusual temperature-dependence and to identify the major products of the reaction--which have not been well established by experiment. Quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T) theoretical level show that the minimum energy path for reaction proceeds: (a) first, via a potential well, which is 39.3 kJ mol(-1) below the energy of the separated reactants, when allowance is made for zero-point energies, corresponding to a quite strongly bound NC-NH3 complex, and (ii) then over a 'submerged' barrier with a crest 10.9 kJ mol(-1) below the energy of the reactants to the products HCN + NH2. These ab initio calculations also demonstrate that there is no low energy path to the products NCNH2 + H.

The overall bimolecular rate constant can be represented by the expression k = (2.8 +/- 0.2) x 10(11) exp[-(700 +/- 30)/T] cm3 mol-1 s-1, which is slightly faster than for the analogous C6H5 + CH2O reaction determined with the same method in the same temperature range.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

The scale is closely related to (yet different from) L. C. Allen's, which is based on configuration energies. Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others. Outliers in agreement with other scales are oxygen and fluorine, now somewhat less electronegative, but in better agreement with their chemistry with the noble gas elements. Group 11 and 12 electronegativities emerge as high, although Au less so than in other scales. Our scale also gives relatively high electronegativities for Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Tc, Cd, Hg (affected by choice of valence state), and Gd. The new electronegativities provide hints for new alloy/compound design, and a framework is in place to analyze those energy changes in reactions in which electronegativity changes may not be controlling.",

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

Lewis and the chemical bond: the electron pair and the octet rule from 1916 to the present day.\nWe describe the development of Lewis's ideas concerning the chemical bond and in particular the concept of the electron pair bond and the octet rule. We show that the concept of the electron pair bond has endured to the present day and is now understood to be a consequence of the Pauli principle. In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory. The electron density distribution in a molecule can now be analyzed using the ELF and other functions of the electron density to show where electron pairs are most probably to be found in a molecule.",

The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness.

For the abstraction channels, multireference methods including CASSCF, CASPT2, and MRCISD were used with the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets. It has been shown that the production of H + HCOOH is the major channel in the chemical activation mechanism. The minor channels include HCO + H2O and OH + CH2O. The hydrogen abstraction by an O atom from the CH2OH radical produces either OH + CH2O or OH + HCOH. Moreover, the two abstraction reactions are essentially barrierless processes. The rate constants for the association of O with CH2OH have been calculated using the flexible transition state theory. A weak negative temperature dependence of the rate constants is found in the range 250-1000 K. Furthermore, it is estimated that the abstraction processes also play an important role in the O + CH2OH reaction.

The total unimolecular rate constant for CF(2)ClCF(2)CH(2)Cl is 0.54 +/- 0.15 x 10(4) s(-1) with branching fractions for 1,2-ClF interchange of 0.03 and 0.97 for 2,3-FH elimination. The total rate constant for CF(2)ClCFClCH(2)F is 1.35 +/- 0.39 x 10(4) s(-1) with branching fractions of 0.20 for 2,3-ClF interchange, 0.71 for 2,3-ClH elimination and 0.09 for 2,3-FH elimination; the products from 1,2-ClF interchange could be observed, but the rate constant was too small to be measured. The D(CH(2)F-CFClCF(2)Cl) and D(CH(2)Cl-CF(2)CF(2)Cl) were evaluated by calculations for some isodesmic reactions and isomerization energies of CF(3)CFClCH(2)Cl as 84 and 88 kcal mol(-1), respectively; these values give the average energies of formed molecules at 298 K as noted above. Density functional theory was used to assign vibrational frequencies and moments of inertia for the molecules and their transition states. These results were combined with statistical unimolecular reaction theory to assign threshold energies from the experimental rate constants for ClF interchange, ClH elimination and FH elimination. These assignments are compared with results from previous chemical activation experiments with CF(3)CFClCH(2)Cl, CF(3)CF(2)CH(3,) CF(3)CFClCH(3) and CF(2)ClCF(2)CH(3).",

In this review, we propose criteria that define the value of combinatorial strategies and categorize the various approaches by: (a) the type of chemical space to be searched, (b) the tactics employed to synthesize and screen libraries, and (c) the structures of individual molecules in libraries. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various strategies and suggest milestones that can help to track their success.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

The field has evolved in the past 50 years and has substantially shaped how chemical research is performed by providing access to chemical information on a scale unattainable by traditional methods. Many physical, chemical and biological data have been predicted from structural data. For the early phases of drug design, methods have been developed that are used in all major pharmaceutical companies. However, all domains of chemistry can benefit from chemoinformatics methods; many areas that are not yet well developed, but could substantially gain from the use of chemoinformatics methods. The quality of data is of crucial importance for successful results. Computer-assisted structure elucidation and computer-assisted synthesis design have been attempted in the early years of chemoinformatics. Because of the importance of these fields to the chemist, new approaches should be made with better hardware and software techniques. Society's concern about the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment could be met by the development of methods for toxicity prediction and risk assessment. In conjunction with bioinformatics, our understanding of the events in living organisms could be deepened and, thus, novel strategies for curing diseases developed. With so many challenging tasks awaiting solutions, the future is bright for chemoinformatics. ",

Two steps encountered by combinatorial scientists appear well suited to ANOVA: the prediction of synthetic outcomes (purity and yield) of set members and the analysis of screening data to identify combinations of reagent inputs that result in molecules with a desired property. To illustrate, a subset of a combinatorial array, referred to as a reaction rehearsal set, is evaluated to create a model predictive of the individual synthetic outcomes of the full matrix.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive. The channel leading to p1 (N2O + CN) has the lowest energy (3.81 kcal/mol), whereas the channels leading to p2 (N2 + NCO) and p2s (N2 + NCS) are the most exothermic (100.94 and 107.38 kcal/mol, respectively).",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

Where the reaction produces a carbanion and CO2, we would expect that the high energy of the carbanion causes the transition state for C-C bond cleavage also to be high in energy. Since the energy of the carbanion is a thermodynamic property, an enzyme obviously cannot change that property. Yet, enzymes overcome the barrier to forming the carbanion. In thinking about decarboxylation, we had assumed that CO2 is well behaved and forms without its own barriers. However, we analyzed reactions in solution of compounds that resemble intermediates in enzymic reaction and found some of them to be subject to unexpected forms of catalysis. Those results caused us to discard the usual assumptions about CO2 and carbanions. We learned that CO2 can be a very reactive electrophile. In decarboxylation reactions, where CO2 forms in the same step as a carbanion, separation of the products might be the main problem preventing the forward reaction because the carbanion can add readily to CO2 in competition with their separation and solvation. The basicity of the carbanion also might be overestimated because when we see that the decarboxylation is slow, we assume that it is because the carbanion is high in energy. We found reactions where the carbanion is protonated internally; CO2 appears to be able to depart without reversion more rapidly. We tested these ideas using kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions, carbon kinetic isotope effects, and synthesis of predecarboxylation intermediates. In another case, we observed that the decarboxylation is subject to general base catalysis while producing a significant carbon kinetic isotope effect. This requires both a proton transfer from an intermediate and C-C bond-breaking in the rate-determining step. This would occur if the route involves the surprising initial addition of water to the carboxyl, with the cleavage step producing bicarbonate. Interestingly, some enzyme-catalyzed reactions also appear to produce intermediates formed by the initial addition of water or a nucleophile to the carboxyl or to nascent CO2. We conclude that decarboxylation is not necessarily a problem that results from the energy of the carbanionic products alone but from their formation in the presence of CO2. Catalysts that facilitate the separation of the species on either side of the C-C bond that cleaves could solve the problem using catalytic principles that we find in many enzymes that promote hydrolytic processes, suggesting linkages in catalysis through evolution of activity.

The Chemical Society's mistreatment of Maximilian Nierenstein.\nBetween 1920 and 1922, the University of Bristol biochemist, Maximilian Nierenstein, published four papers in a series exploring the structure of catechin in the <iJournal of the Chemical Society.</i The Society then abruptly refused to accept any more of his papers on catechin, or any other subject. It provided him with no reasons for the embargo until 1925. It then transpired that Nierenstein was boycotted because it was deemed that he had not responded adequately to criticisms of his work made by his rival in catechin research, the German natural products chemist, Karl Freudenberg. It was not until 1929 that, as a result of a petition by a group of his former Bristol pupils and friends, that Nierenstein was again permitted to publish in the Society's journal. The paper explores the Chemical Society's treatment of Nierenstein in detail, sheds new light on his career and his reaction to the Society's unprecedented boycott, examines some of the structural chemistry involved in the disputes, and discusses whether Nierenstein's research deserves the label of 'bad science'.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

It is now clear that this was a misconception, and a multitude of gold-catalysed transformations has been reported. However, one consequence of the long-held view of gold as inert metal is that its organometallic chemistry contains many \"unknowns\", and catalytic cycles devised to explain gold's reactivity draw largely on analogies with other transition metals. How realistic are such mechanistic assumptions? In the last few years a number of key compound classes have been discovered that can provide some answers. This Perspective attempts to summarise these developments, with particular emphasis on recently discovered gold(iii) complexes with bonds to hydrogen, oxygen, alkenes and CO ligands. ",

We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial η2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.",

                    "contents": "CDF-XL: computing cumulative distribution functions of reaction time data in Excel.\nIn experimental psychology, central tendencies of reaction time (RT) distributions are used to compare different experimental conditions. This emphasis on the central tendency ignores additional information that may be derived from the RT distribution itself. One method for analysing RT distributions is to construct cumulative distribution frequency plots (CDFs; Ratcliff, Psychological Bulletin 86:446-461, 1979). However, this method is difficult to implement in widely available software, severely restricting its use. In this report, we present an Excel-based program, CDF-XL, for constructing and analysing CDFs, with the aim of making such techniques more readily accessible to researchers, including students (CDF-XL can be downloaded free of charge from the Psychonomic Society's online archive). CDF-XL functions as an Excel workbook and starts from the raw experimental data, organised into three columns (Subject, Condition, and RT) on an Input Data worksheet (a point-and-click utility is provided for achieving this format from a broader data set). No further preprocessing or sorting of the data is required. With one click of a button, CDF-XL will generate two forms of cumulative analysis: (1) \"standard\" CDFs, based on percentiles of participant RT distributions (by condition), and (2) a related analysis employing the participant means of rank-ordered RT bins. Both analyses involve partitioning the data in similar ways, but the first uses a \"median\"-type measure at the participant level, while the latter uses the mean. The results are presented in three formats: (i) by participants, suitable for entry into further statistical analysis; (ii) grand means by condition; and (iii) completed CDF plots in Excel charts.",

A randomization test is not a different statistical test but a different, and always valid, method of determining statistical significance. The familiar t-test and F-test can be carried out by data permutation without any parametric assumptions being fulfilled. A particular advantage of this method is that unbalanced designs and missing values are easily accommodated. Even with only a small number of subjects the number of permutations will be large and a computer is necessary if the randomization test is to be of practical value. To make this method of determining statistical significance generally available an interactive microcomputer program, forming a comprehensive package for the design and analysis of experiments, has been prepared.",

We illustrate the use of the contrast F and t to compare and combine predictions when the raw data are continuous scores, and z contrasts when working with frequencies in 2 x k tables of counts. The traditional effect size correlation indicates the magnitude of the effect on individual scores of participants' assignment to particular conditions. The contrast correlation obtained from the contrast F or t is, in some cases, the easiest way of estimating the effect size correlation in designs using more than two groups. The alerting correlation is another way of appraising the predictive power of a contrast and can be used to compute the contrast F from published results when all we have are condition means and the omnibus F from an overall analysis of variance. Omnibus Fs, those with more than 1 df in the numerator, are rarely useful in data analytic work since they address unfocused questions, yielding only vague answers. Asking focused questions using contrasts increases the clarity of our questions and the clarity and statistical power of our answers.",

Although early studies pointed to the feasibility of such a process, those precedents were never applied by others due to cumbersome setups and limited scope. Here we show that a carefully optimized electroreductive procedure can enable a more sustainable approach to NHK, even in an asymmetric fashion on highly complex medicinally relevant systems. The e-NHK can even enable non-canonical substrate classes, such as redox-active esters, to participate with low loadings of Cr when conventional chemical techniques fail. A combination of detailed kinetics, cyclic voltammetry, and in situ UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry of these processes illuminates the subtle features of this mechanistically intricate process.",

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4. In this case, computational results support electrochemical data in backing a direct electron transfer reaction.",

If V(R(c)) goes through a maximum, as is commonly the case, then F(R(c)) has a characteristic profile: a negative minimum followed by zero at the transition state and then a positive maximum. These features reflect four phases of the reaction: an initial one of reactant preparation, followed by two of transition to products, and then relaxation of the latter. In this study, we have analyzed, in these terms, a gas-phase S(N)2 substitution, selected to be CH3Cl + H2O --&gt; CH3OH + HCl.

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies. The mechanism is similar to those of the HO-C(2)H(2)/C(2)H(4) systems. The rate constants for the low energy channels have been predicted by statistical theory. For the reaction of ClO and C(2)H(2), the main channels are the production of CH(2)CO + Cl (k(1a)) and CHCO + HCl (k(1b)), with k(1a) = 1.19 × 10(-15)T(1.18) exp(-5814/T) and k(1b) = 6.94 × 10(-21) × T(2.60) exp(-6587/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1).

Applications to systems which deviate from the Arrhenius law at low temperature encouraged the development of a user-friendly graphical interface for estimating the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of physical and chemical processes. Here, we document the Transitivity code, written in Python, a free open-source code compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS platforms. Procedures are made available to evaluate the phenomenology of the temperature dependence of rate constants for processes from the Arrhenius and Transitivity plots. Reaction rate constants can be calculated by the traditional Transition-State Theory using a set of one-dimensional tunneling corrections (Bell (1935), Bell (1958), Skodje and Truhlar and, in particular, the deformed ( d -TST) approach). To account for the solvent effect on reaction rate constant, implementation is given of the Kramers and of Collins-Kimball formulations. An input file generator is provided to run various molecular dynamics approaches in CPMD code. Examples are worked out and made available for testing. The novelty of this code is its general scope and particular exploit of d <i-</iformulations to cope with non-Arrhenius behavior at low temperatures, a topic which is the focus of recent intense investigations. We expect that this code serves as a quick and practical tool for data documentation from electronic structure calculations: It presents a very intuitive graphical interface which we believe to provide an excellent working tool for researchers and as courseware to teach statistical thermodynamics, thermochemistry, kinetics, and related areas.",

Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

The measurements were carried out in Pyrex reactors using a mixture of CFCl2H, CH4, and Cl2 in either N2 or N2/O2 diluent. Reactants and products were quantified by GC/FID analysis. Cl atoms were generated by irradiation of the mixture with 360 nm light to dissociate the Cl2 for temperatures up to ~550 K. At higher temperature, the Cl2 dissociated thermally, and no irradiation was used. Over the temperature range 298-670 K, k1 is consistently a factor of ~5 smaller than that of k2 with a nearly identical temperature dependence. The optimum non-Arrhenius rate constant is represented by the expression k1 = 1.14 × 10(-22) T(3.49) e(-241/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) with an estimated uncertainty of ±15% including uncertainty in the reference reaction.

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies.

For the reaction of ClO and C(2)H(2), the main channels are the production of CH(2)CO + Cl (k(1a)) and CHCO + HCl (k(1b)), with k(1a) = 1.19 × 10(-15)T(1.18) exp(-5814/T) and k(1b) = 6.94 × 10(-21) × T(2.60) exp(-6587/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1).

Phys. Chem. 1988 , 92 , 2455 - 2462 ). These corrections necessitated the development of a detailed model of the B̃(2)A1' (3s)-X̃(2)A2″ transition in CH3 and its validation against both low temperature and high temperature experimental absorption cross sections. A master equation (ME) model was developed, using a local linearization of the second-order decay, which allows the use of standard matrix diagonalization methods for the determination of the rate coefficients for CH3 + CH3. The ME model utilized inverse Laplace transformation to link the microcanonical rate constants for dissociation of C2H6 to the limiting high pressure rate coefficient for association, k∞(T); it was used to fit the experimental rate coefficients using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize χ(2) calculated from the differences between experimental and calculated rate coefficients. Parameters for both k∞(T) and for energy transfer ⟨ΔE⟩down(T) were varied and optimized in the fitting procedure. A wide range of experimental data were fitted, covering the temperature range 300-2000 K. A high pressure limit of k∞(T) = 5.76 × 10(-11)(T/298 K)(-0.34) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) was obtained, which agrees well with the best available theoretical expression. ",

Thus, it is well-known how the rate of ionization of R-X is affected by the stabilization of the carbocation R(+), the nature of the leaving group X(-), or the solvent ionizing power. On the other hand, when asked to estimate the half-life of the ionization of a certain substrate in a certain solvent, most chemists resign. This question, however, is crucial in daily laboratory practice. Can a certain substrate R-X be handled in alcoholic or aqueous solution without being solvolyzed? Can a biologically active tertiary amine or azole be released by ionization of a quaternary ammonium ion? In this Account, we describe a straightforward means of addressing such experimental concerns. A semiquantitative answer to these questions is given by the correlation equation log k(25 °C) = s(f)(N(f) + E(f)), in which carbocations R(+) are characterized by the electrofugality parameter E(f), and leaving groups X(-) in a certain solvent are characterized by the nucleofugality parameter N(f) and the nucleofuge-specific sensitivity parameter s(f). As s(f) is typically around 1 (0.8 &lt; s(f) &lt; 1.2), ionization half-lives of around 1 h at 25 °C can be expected when E(f) + N(f) = -4. This correlation equation is formally analogous to the linear free energy relationship that was used to derive the most comprehensive nucleophilicity and electrophilicity scales presently available (Mayr, H.; Bug, T.; Gotta, M. F.; Hering, N.; Irrgang, B.; Janker, B.; Kempf, B.; Loos, R.; Ofial, A. R.; Remennikov, G.; Schimmel, H. Reference Scales for the Characterization of Cationic Electrophiles and Neutral Nucleophiles. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 9500-9512). By subjecting 628 solvolysis rate constants k(25 °C) for different benzhydryl derivatives (aryl(2)CH-X) to a least-squares minimization on the basis of the correlation equation, we obtained and tabulate here (i) the electrofugality parameters E(f) for 39 benzhydrylium ions and (ii) the nucleofuge-specific parameters N(f) and s(f) for 101 combinations of common leaving groups and solvents. We show that the E(f) parameters of the reference electrofuges can be used to determine N(f) and s(f) for almost any combination of leaving group and solvent. The nucleofuge-specific parameters of the reference systems can analogously be used to derive the electrofugalities E(f) of other types of carbocations. While it has long been recognized that good nucleophiles are not necessarily poor nucleofuges, it is now reported that there is also no general inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality. Although more electrophilic methyl- and methoxy-substituted benzhydrylium ions are generally weaker electrofuges, the inverse relationship between electrophilicity and electrofugality breaks down in the series of amino-substituted benzhydrylium ions. Because neither differential solvation of the carbocations nor steric effects are explicitly considered by this treatment, predictions for substrates not belonging to the benzhydrylium series are only reliable within a factor of 10. This is hardly acceptable to physical organic chemists, who are used to high precision within narrow groups of compounds. The synthetic chemist, however, who is seeking orientation in a reactivity range of 25 orders of magnitude, might appreciate the simplicity of this approach, which only requires considering the sum E(f) + N(f) or consulting our summary graphs.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained.

We closely follow the formation and evolution of the pivotal C-C, C-O, C[double bond, length as m-dash]O, and C-N bonds, which dictate the chemistry of the molecules of life. In many cases, formation of these bonds is set in motion by proton transfers in which individual water molecules act as catalysts so that water atoms end up in the products. Our results indicate that the prebiotic formation of carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, formic acid, formaldimine, glycolaldehyde, glycine, glycolonitrile, and oxazole derivatives, among others, are best described as highly nonsynchronous concerted single step processes. Nonetheless, for all reactions involving double proton transfer, the formation and breaking of O-H bonds around a particular O atom occur in a synchronous fashion, apparently independently from other primitive processes. For the most part, the first process to initiate seems to be the double proton transfer in the reactions where they are present, then bond breaking/formation around the reactive carbon in the carbonyl group and finally rupture of the C-N bonds in the appropriate cases, which are the most reluctant to break.

The reaction mechanism and rate constant are also theoretically predicted for the temperature range of 200-2000 K and the He and N 2 pressure range of 10 (-4) Torr to 1000 atm based on dual-channel Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory with the potential energy surface evaluated at the G2M//B3LYP/6-311+G(d) level. In the low-temperature range (&lt;700 K), the most favorable reaction is the barrierless association channel that leads to the intermediate complex (NCN-NO 2). At high temperature, the direct O-abstraction reaction with a barrier of 9.8 kcal/mol becomes the dominant channel. The rate constant calculated by RRKM theory agrees reasonably well with experimental data.",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed.

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis.

Where the reaction produces a carbanion and CO2, we would expect that the high energy of the carbanion causes the transition state for C-C bond cleavage also to be high in energy. Since the energy of the carbanion is a thermodynamic property, an enzyme obviously cannot change that property. Yet, enzymes overcome the barrier to forming the carbanion. In thinking about decarboxylation, we had assumed that CO2 is well behaved and forms without its own barriers. However, we analyzed reactions in solution of compounds that resemble intermediates in enzymic reaction and found some of them to be subject to unexpected forms of catalysis. Those results caused us to discard the usual assumptions about CO2 and carbanions. We learned that CO2 can be a very reactive electrophile. In decarboxylation reactions, where CO2 forms in the same step as a carbanion, separation of the products might be the main problem preventing the forward reaction because the carbanion can add readily to CO2 in competition with their separation and solvation. The basicity of the carbanion also might be overestimated because when we see that the decarboxylation is slow, we assume that it is because the carbanion is high in energy. We found reactions where the carbanion is protonated internally; CO2 appears to be able to depart without reversion more rapidly. We tested these ideas using kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions, carbon kinetic isotope effects, and synthesis of predecarboxylation intermediates. In another case, we observed that the decarboxylation is subject to general base catalysis while producing a significant carbon kinetic isotope effect. This requires both a proton transfer from an intermediate and C-C bond-breaking in the rate-determining step. This would occur if the route involves the surprising initial addition of water to the carboxyl, with the cleavage step producing bicarbonate. Interestingly, some enzyme-catalyzed reactions also appear to produce intermediates formed by the initial addition of water or a nucleophile to the carboxyl or to nascent CO2. We conclude that decarboxylation is not necessarily a problem that results from the energy of the carbanionic products alone but from their formation in the presence of CO2. Catalysts that facilitate the separation of the species on either side of the C-C bond that cleaves could solve the problem using catalytic principles that we find in many enzymes that promote hydrolytic processes, suggesting linkages in catalysis through evolution of activity.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

An ab initio calculation of the potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction at the CCSD(T)/CEP-31G//DFT-B3LYP/CEP-31G level of theory was also performed.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

For the abstraction channels, multireference methods including CASSCF, CASPT2, and MRCISD were used with the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets.

The hydrogen abstraction by an O atom from the CH2OH radical produces either OH + CH2O or OH + HCOH. Moreover, the two abstraction reactions are essentially barrierless processes. The rate constants for the association of O with CH2OH have been calculated using the flexible transition state theory. A weak negative temperature dependence of the rate constants is found in the range 250-1000 K.

For systems in which no chemical transformation occurs, determination of interaction energies of the whole system with respect to the interaction energies between all individual component pairs (subsystems) will allow determination of cooperativity. For systems comprising of chemical transformations, cooperativity can be evaluated by determining the activation energy of the synergistic system and by comparing this with activation energies of the corresponding subsystems that lack an activating moiety.

Phys. Chem. 1988 , 92 , 2455 - 2462 ). These corrections necessitated the development of a detailed model of the B̃(2)A1' (3s)-X̃(2)A2″ transition in CH3 and its validation against both low temperature and high temperature experimental absorption cross sections. A master equation (ME) model was developed, using a local linearization of the second-order decay, which allows the use of standard matrix diagonalization methods for the determination of the rate coefficients for CH3 + CH3. The ME model utilized inverse Laplace transformation to link the microcanonical rate constants for dissociation of C2H6 to the limiting high pressure rate coefficient for association, k∞(T); it was used to fit the experimental rate coefficients using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize χ(2) calculated from the differences between experimental and calculated rate coefficients. Parameters for both k∞(T) and for energy transfer ⟨ΔE⟩down(T) were varied and optimized in the fitting procedure. A wide range of experimental data were fitted, covering the temperature range 300-2000 K.

This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous. (We speculate that for a nonconcerted process this maximum is actually positive.) Thus, κ(R) can serve as an indicator of the level of nonsynchronicity.",

New features include a treatment of the C isotope effect and a proposed nonstatistical effect in the reaction. The latter was prompted by existing kinetic results and molecular-beam data of Simons and co-workers on incomplete intramolecular energy transfer to the highest vibrational frequency mode in HOCO(*). In treating the many kinetic properties two small customary vertical adjustments of the barriers of the two transition states were made. The resulting calculations show reasonable agreement with the experimental data on (1) the pressure and temperature dependence of the HD effect, (2) the pressure-dependent (12)C(13)C isotope effect, (3) the strong non-Arrhenius behavior observed at low temperatures, (4) the high-temperature data, and (5) the pressure dependence of rate constants in various bath gases. The kinetic carbon isotopic effect is usually less than 10 per mil. A striking consequence of the nonstatistical assumption is the removal of a major discrepancy in a plot of the k(OH+CO)k(OD+CO) ratio versus pressure.

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C.

The prominence of the P-S cyclization is brought about by the inheritance from analogous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the biogenetic pathways of natural products, mainly indole alkaloids, with a broad range of biological activities. This knowledge has been the starting point for the biomimetic synthesis or the bio-engineering production of pharmacologically important drugs. The long-lasting life of the P-S reaction depends on the discovery of its multiple facets, the modifications of its parameters and components, as well as the continuous renovation of solutions for the challenging stereochemical outcome of the transformation. This paper deals with an updated visit to the P-S reaction aiming to find the threads of the story without forgetting the numerous facets of the prism. It is organized as a theater piece, with a prologue and the main scene (namely, Act 1) where the readers can follow the parade of the two above-mentioned very recurring motifs (namely, THIQ and THBC) by moving from one step to another (a cyclization, an intramolecular attack, a stereoselective passage) to find the way out of the labyrinth of the P-S reaction.

His synthetic and mechanistic studies have contributed to areas including non-benzenoid aromatics, carbenes, pericyclic reactions, and diradical intermediates. Doering's synthesis with L. H. Knox of the highly stable tropylium ion and their investigation of its reactivity were the starting point for the development of the field of non-benzenoid aromatics. Working with A. K. Hoffmann, Doering demonstrated the synthesis of dichloro- and dibromocarbene by base-induced alpha elimination of HCl or HBr from CHCl3 or CHBr3 under anhydrous conditions. These results allowed for the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and derivatives including allenes. Using 14C labeling experiments, Doering and Prinzbach showed that the mechanism of insertion of singlet methylene into a C-H bond was a concerted process.In their work on the Cope rearrangement, Doering and Roth's outstanding stereochemical analysis showed that the rearrangement of acyclic 1,5-hexadienes proceeds concertedly, passing over a chairlike transition state. This work has had an enormous impact on the understanding of stereochemical control in synthetic organic chemistry, and many fruitful applications in synthesis have stemmed directly from this finding. Transition-state resonance structures analogous to those for ground-state aromatics can qualitatively explain the relatively large substituent effects on the rate of the Cope rearrangement. However, quantum chemical calculations have quantitatively described these effects. The rapid degenerate Cope rearrangements in the cis-divinylcyclopropane units of 3,4-homotropilidene, barbaralone, and bullvalene establish these molecules as having fluxional structures. The unique molecule bullvalene has more than 1.2 million possible structures interconnected by degenerate Cope rearrangements, which average all H and all C atoms. Doering has also examined stepwise thermal reorganizations that pass through intermediary 1,3- or 1,4-diradicals and do not show conformational equilibration as would be expected for classical intermediates. Doering calls these processes \"not-obviously concerted\". He discusses \"continuous diradicals\" as transition states and rationalizes the course of these reactions through the concept of a \"caldera\" (a flat surface with small energy wells as found on the top of volcanoes).The understanding of fundamental chemical reactions remains the focus of Doering's research. In his terms, \"understanding\" means not only gaining deep insight but also the intellectual control that allows researchers to predict a reaction's course. Because the interplay between theory and experiment has led to great progress in this predictive ability, Doering's experimental work has provided an important input for computational chemistry and to the essential understanding of chemical reactions.",

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Special emphasis will be put on the effect of reactants' and products' concentrations, and how to easily and accurately understand their influence on the kinetics. Ultimately, we will try to explore if energy truly is the measure of all things.",

Combinatorial analysis of C1 chemistry\nMost chemical reactions occur over multiple steps whose identity is elucidated by experiment, yielding a reaction mechanism.

The MECHEM computer program searches this space comprehensively for the simplest plausible mechanisms. We use MECHEM to find mechanisms for Fischer-Tropsch chemistry and CO2 re-forming of methane, both heterogeneous catalytic reactions of current importance. The results reveal hundreds of equally simple mechanisms consistent with evidence. Hence, mechanism elucidation in catalysis is a much harder problem than is ordinarily realized.",

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Some features that contribute to its popularity include: it produces all possible structural combinations of the monomers, it has outstanding productivity, it leads to the formation of individual compounds in nearly equimolar quantities (affected by statistics and incomplete reactions), and it can be applied to all classes of organic compounds. Since an enormously large number of compounds can be produced in principle in a relatively short time, some practical considerations are discussed that can be useful in library design. Encoding organic libraries by peptide or nucleotide sequences or with binary tags are also described together with methods for tagging macroscopic support units with electronic chips, two dimensional bar codes or colored resin and capsule caps. Among the deconvolution strategies, the iteration method, positional scanning, omission libraries, the Selectide and the Pharmacopeia methods are mentioned. A collection of libraries prepared by portioning-mixing is also included in graphical format.",

These constraints reinforce the limitations of the synthetic biology ideal, limitations that are often freely acknowledged by synthetic biology's own practitioners. The synthetic biology methodology reflects a series of constraints imposed on finite human designers who wish, as far as is practicable, to communicate with each other and to intervene in nature in reasonably targeted and well-understood ways.

Multivariate normal distributions are typically used. The number of clusters is usually determined from the data, often using BIC. In practice, however, individual clusters can be poorly fitted by Gaussian distributions, and in that case model-based clustering tends to represent one non-Gaussian cluster by a mixture of two or more Gaussian distributions. If the number of mixture components is interpreted as the number of clusters, this can lead to overestimation of the number of clusters. This is because BIC selects the number of mixture components needed to provide a good approximation to the density, rather than the number of clusters as such. We propose first selecting the total number of Gaussian mixture components, K, using BIC and then combining them hierarchically according to an entropy criterion. This yields a unique soft clustering for each number of clusters less than or equal to K. These clusterings can be compared on substantive grounds, and we also describe an automatic way of selecting the number of clusters via a piecewise linear regression fit to the rescaled entropy plot. We illustrate the method with simulated data and a flow cytometry dataset. Supplemental Materials are available on the journal Web site and described at the end of the paper.",

In BHG, we assume that the configuration of image elements is generated by a mixture of distinct objects, each of which generates image elements according to some generative assumptions. Grouping, in this framework, means estimating the number and the parameters of the mixture components that generated the image, including estimating which image elements are \"owned\" by which objects. We present a tractable implementation of the framework, based on the hierarchical clustering approach of Heller and Ghahramani (2005). We illustrate it with examples drawn from a number of classical perceptual grouping problems, including dot clustering, contour integration, and part decomposition. Our approach yields an intuitive hierarchical representation of image elements, giving an explicit decomposition of the image into mixture components, along with estimates of the probability of various candidate decompositions. We show that BHG accounts well for a diverse range of empirical data drawn from the literature. Because BHG provides a principled quantification of the plausibility of grouping interpretations over a wide range of grouping problems, we argue that it provides an appealing unifying account of the elusive Gestalt notion of Prägnanz.",

The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance.

We characterize the manifold of decorrelating matrices and show that it lies along the ridges of high-likelihood unmixing matrices in the space of all unmixing matrices.

The prominence of the P-S cyclization is brought about by the inheritance from analogous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the biogenetic pathways of natural products, mainly indole alkaloids, with a broad range of biological activities. This knowledge has been the starting point for the biomimetic synthesis or the bio-engineering production of pharmacologically important drugs. The long-lasting life of the P-S reaction depends on the discovery of its multiple facets, the modifications of its parameters and components, as well as the continuous renovation of solutions for the challenging stereochemical outcome of the transformation. This paper deals with an updated visit to the P-S reaction aiming to find the threads of the story without forgetting the numerous facets of the prism. It is organized as a theater piece, with a prologue and the main scene (namely, Act 1) where the readers can follow the parade of the two above-mentioned very recurring motifs (namely, THIQ and THBC) by moving from one step to another (a cyclization, an intramolecular attack, a stereoselective passage) to find the way out of the labyrinth of the P-S reaction.

However, if no proton transfer takes place and the result is a molecular cocrystal, a crystal lattice with an unexpected chemical content or stoichiometry is much less likely (3/61; 5%). These results indicate that the process of converting a neutral carboxylic acid into a carboxylate anion can have important structural consequences that make structure prediction and targeted supramolecular synthesis of salts much more difficult than of cocrystals.

Meta-analysis has several advantages: it estimates the size of an effect; it improves the generalizability; it compels to rigor; it lessens the part of subjectivity.

Because the results of a meta-analysis depend on the quality of the included studies, the quality and risk of bias of all studies should be systematically assessed. Quantitative summary of results is only practicable if the studies are homogeneous, i.e. sufficiently similar with respect to the study populations, interventions or exposure, outcomes and point of measurement. In cases of clinical heterogeneity, meta-analysis could be conducted in clinically homogeneous subgroups. Statistical heterogeneity can be discounted by using a random-effects model.

Developing Summary of Findings tables - dichotomous outcomes].\nSummary of Findings (SoF) tables present, for each of the seven (or fewer) most important outcomes, the following: the number of studies and number of participants; the confidence in effect estimates (quality of evidence); and the best estimates of relative and absolute effects. Potentially challenging choices in preparing SoF tables include using direct evidence (which may have very few events) or indirect evidence (from a surrogate) as the best evidence for a treatment effect. If a surrogate is chosen, it must be labeled as substituting for the corresponding patient-important outcome. Another such choice is presenting evidence from low-quality randomised trials or high-quality observational studies. When in doubt, a reasonable approach is to present both sets of evidence; if the two bodies of evidence have similar quality but discrepant results, one would rate down further for inconsistency. For binary outcomes, relative risks (RRs) are the preferred measure of relative effect and, in most instances, are applied to the baseline or control group risks to generate absolute risks. Ideally, the baseline risks come from observational studies including representative patients and identifying easily measured prognostic factors that define groups at differing risk. In the absence of such studies, relevant randomised trials provide estimates of baseline risk. When confidence intervals (CIs) around the relative effect include no difference, one may simply state in the absolute risk column that results fail to show a difference, omit the point estimate and report only the CIs, or add a comment emphasizing the uncertainty associated with the point estimate. KEY STATEMENTS: Summary of Findings (SoF) tables provide succinct; easily digestible presentations of confidence in effect estimates (quality of evidence) and magnitude of effects. SoF tables should present the seven (or fewer) most important outcomes. These outcomes must always be patient-important outcomes and never be surrogates, although surrogates can be used to estimate effects on patient-important outcomes. SoF tables should present the highest quality evidence. When the quality of two bodies of evidence (e.g., randomised trials and observational studies) is similar, SoF tables may include summaries from both. SoF tables should include both relative and absolute effect measures, and separate estimates of absolute effect for identifiable patient groups with substantially different baseline or control group risks.",

In this, the first of a two-part series exploring concepts in linear regression analysis, the four fundamental assumptions and the mechanics of simple linear regression are reviewed. The most common technique used to derive the regression line, the method of least squares, is described. The reader will be acquainted with other important concepts in simple linear regression, including: variable transformations, dummy variables, relationship to inference testing, and leverage. Simplified clinical examples with small datasets and graphic models are used to illustrate the points. This will provide a foundation for the second article in this series: a discussion of multiple linear regression, in which there are multiple predictor variables.",

As with all statistical methods, there are indications and contraindications for the use of meta-analysis. Additionally, meta-analysis is dependent upon the quality of data applied, the bias of the test itself, and the interpretation of the results.

These include reaction energies of both open- and closed-shell reactions, atomization energies, electron affinities, ionization potentials, equilibrium geometries, and harmonic vibrational frequencies. For all these quantities, results better than the AV5Z quality are obtained already with AVTZ basis sets, and usually AVDZ treatments reach at least the conventional AVQZ quality. For larger molecules, the additional cost for these improvements is only a few percent of the time for a standard CCSD(T) calculation.

Application to diatomic force curves and transition states of several well-characterized reactions are made.

The 2,3- and 1,2-ClF interchange reactions compete with 2,3-ClH and 2,3-FH elimination reactions. The total unimolecular rate constant for CF(2)ClCF(2)CH(2)Cl is 0.54 +/- 0.15 x 10(4) s(-1) with branching fractions for 1,2-ClF interchange of 0.03 and 0.97 for 2,3-FH elimination. The total rate constant for CF(2)ClCFClCH(2)F is 1.35 +/- 0.39 x 10(4) s(-1) with branching fractions of 0.20 for 2,3-ClF interchange, 0.71 for 2,3-ClH elimination and 0.09 for 2,3-FH elimination; the products from 1,2-ClF interchange could be observed, but the rate constant was too small to be measured. The D(CH(2)F-CFClCF(2)Cl) and D(CH(2)Cl-CF(2)CF(2)Cl) were evaluated by calculations for some isodesmic reactions and isomerization energies of CF(3)CFClCH(2)Cl as 84 and 88 kcal mol(-1), respectively; these values give the average energies of formed molecules at 298 K as noted above. Density functional theory was used to assign vibrational frequencies and moments of inertia for the molecules and their transition states. These results were combined with statistical unimolecular reaction theory to assign threshold energies from the experimental rate constants for ClF interchange, ClH elimination and FH elimination. These assignments are compared with results from previous chemical activation experiments with CF(3)CFClCH(2)Cl, CF(3)CF(2)CH(3,) CF(3)CFClCH(3) and CF(2)ClCF(2)CH(3).",

In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory. The electron density distribution in a molecule can now be analyzed using the ELF and other functions of the electron density to show where electron pairs are most probably to be found in a molecule.",

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

To achieve this, the minimum number of diagrams is evaluated, which is less than in the corresponding CC model. For all practical purposes, nCC is also the proper definition of a size-extensive CI. 2CC is also an orbitally invariant coupled electron pair approximation. The numerical results of nCC are close to those for the full CC variant, and in some cases are closer to the full CI reference result. As 2CC is exact for separated electron pairs, it is the natural zeroth-order approximation for the correlation problem in molecules with other effects introduced as these units start to interact. The nCC hierarchy of approximations has all the attractive features of CC including its size extensivity, orbital invariance, and orbital insensitivity, but in a conceptually appealing form suited to bond breaking, while being computationally less demanding.

The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

Improvements on the original ccCA formalism include replacing the small basis set quadratic configuration interaction computation with a coupled cluster computation, employing a correction for scalar relativistic effects, utilizing the tight-d forms of the second-row correlation-consistent basis sets, and revisiting the basis set chosen for geometry optimization. With two types of complete basis set extrapolation of MP2 energies, ccCA results in an almost zero mean deviation for the G3/99 set (with a best value of -0.10 kcal mol(-1)), and a 0.96 kcal mol(-1) mean absolute deviation, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the G3X model chemistry. There are no optimized or empirical parameters included in the computation of ccCA energies.

It was shown that the gas-phase reaction of W with CO2 proceeds with a negligible barrier via an insertion pathway, W(7S)+CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta2-OCO)(6A')--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)(1A)--&gt;WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma). This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center. The overall reaction W+(6D) + CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta1-OCO)+(6A)--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)+(4A)--&gt;WO+(4Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma) is calculated to be exothermic by 25.4 kcal/mol. The cationic reaction proceeds with a somewhat large (9.9 kcal/mol) barrier and produces two intermediates, W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) and OW(eta1-CO)+(4A). Intermediate W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) is 20.0 kcal/mol less stable than OW(eta1-CO)+(4A), and separated from the latter by a 35.2 kcal/mol barrier. Complex W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) is characterized as an ion-molecular complex type of W+-(CO2). Gas-phase reactions of M=W/W+ with CO lead to the formation of a W-carbonyl complex M(eta1-CO) for both M=W and W+. The C-O insertion product, OMC, lies by 5.2 and 69.3 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding M(eta1-CO) isomer, for M=W and W+, respectively, and is separated from the latter by a large energy barrier.",

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies. The mechanism is similar to those of the HO-C(2)H(2)/C(2)H(4) systems. The rate constants for the low energy channels have been predicted by statistical theory. For the reaction of ClO and C(2)H(2), the main channels are the production of CH(2)CO + Cl (k(1a)) and CHCO + HCl (k(1b)), with k(1a) = 1.19 × 10(-15)T(1.18) exp(-5814/T) and k(1b) = 6.94 × 10(-21) × T(2.60) exp(-6587/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1).

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO. At a temperature of 50 degrees C under 1 atm of CO the net reaction 4(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + H(2)S --&gt; 2HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO occurs within minutes without formation of detectable amounts of HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5).",

The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive. The channel leading to p1 (N2O + CN) has the lowest energy (3.81 kcal/mol), whereas the channels leading to p2 (N2 + NCO) and p2s (N2 + NCS) are the most exothermic (100.94 and 107.38 kcal/mol, respectively).",

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4.

Redox (trace-metal) catalysis also involves the oxidation and reduction of radical intermediates with a metal species which oscillates between several oxidation states (4). The oxidation and reduction of free radicals with metal complexes follow two general mechanisms, electron transfer and ligand transfer. Direct analogy exists with wholly inorganic descriptions of outer-sphere and innersphere processes. In an electron transfer or outersphere mechanism the redox process is derived largely by transfer of an electron from reductant to oxidant, with only indirect contributions from the solvent and ligand. Carbonium ion intermediates and transition states are important considerations, and the scission of the beta-hydrogen bond is minor during oxidation of alkyl radicals to alkenes. In contrast, ligand transfer or inner-sphere mechanism demands maximum involvement of the ligand in the transition state. Free-radical character prevails; cationic contributions from the organic moiety are minimal. Oxidation and reduction are conjugate processes. In an electron transfer mechanism the oxidation of alkyl radicals to carbonium ions is conceptually represented by a microscopic reverse reaction in which a carbonium ion is reduced to an alkyl radical. A similar duality exists in the interconversion of carbanions and free radicals by metal complexes. The reversibility of the ligand transfer process is easier to observe. For example, the chlorine-transfer oxidation of alkyl radicals is represented by a microscopic reverse reduction of alkyl chlorides to alkyl radicals by cuprous chlorides. A ligand transfer counterpart of the reduction of radicals R*+Cu(II)Cl(n)&lt;----&gt;R-Cl+Cu(I)Cl(n-1) can also be described. Hopefully, these simple redox mechanisms will be utilized in rationalizing complex reactions and formulating new syntheses. The limited number of examples cited in this short review represent only an introduction to the vast area of chemical research to be tapped in the study of the mechanisms and the synthetic utility of oxidation-reduction reactions and catalysis.",

N(2)O and HNO(2) are attributed to decomposition of the initial product HNO.

The rate of reaction is not inhibited by CO. The kinetic isotope effect for reaction of D-Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) is k(H)/k(D) = 1.7. These observations are consistent with a first step involving direct H (D) atom transfer from the metal hydride to *NO, forming HNO.

The gas-phase affinity of the anilide ion to CO2 is significantly higher than that of the phenoxide anion (m/z 93), which adds to CO2 only very sluggishly. Our results suggest that the efficacy of CO2 capture depends on the natural charge density on the nitrogen atom, and relative nucleophilicity of the anilide anion.

For example, the anion generated from p-methoxyaniline (PA = 367 kcal/mol) reacts significantly faster than that obtained from p-nitroaniline (PA = 343 kcal/mol). Although deprotonated p-aminobenzoic acid adds very poorly because the negative charge is now located primarily on the carboxylate group, it reacts more efficiently with CO2 if the carboxyl group is esterified. Moreover, mixture of CO2 and He as the collision gas was found to afford more efficient adduct formation than CO2 alone, or as mixtures made with nitrogen or argon, because helium acts as an effective \"cooling\" gas and reduces the internal energy of reactant ions.",

S(N)Ar reaction of 4-nitroaniline (2a) in aqueous NaOH for 16 h yields 4-nitrophenol (4a) quantitatively, whereas a similar reaction of 4-nitrochlorobenzene (1a) gave 4a in 2% yield together with recovered 1a in 97%, suggesting that the leaving ability of the NH(2) group far surpasses that of Cl under these conditions. An essential feature of S(N)Ar reactions of nitroanilines is probably that the NH(2) leaving group participates in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with H(2)O. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a set of 4-nitroaniline, OH(-), and H(2)O suggest a possible formation of a Meisenheimer complex stabilized by hydrogen-bonding interactions and a six-membered ring structure.

This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous. (We speculate that for a nonconcerted process this maximum is actually positive.) Thus, κ(R) can serve as an indicator of the level of nonsynchronicity.",

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained.

Examples involving the benchmark F + H2 and D + H2 reactions at energies ranging from ultralow to hyperthermal illustrate how canonical and other reaction mechanisms can be visualised and also how analysis of a reaction in terms of its canonical mechanisms can provide insight into its dynamics.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, considered by many to be the father of TST, never resolved the question as to the definition of the activation energy for which Arrhenius became famous. In 1978, Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 2959 (1978)] finally showed that especially when considering condensed phases, the activation energy is a free energy, it is the barrier height in the potential of mean force felt by the reacting system. Parallel to the development of rate theory in the chemistry community, Kramers published in 1940 [Physica (Amsterdam) 7, 284 (1940)] a seminal paper on the relation between Einstein's theory of Brownian motion [Einstein, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)] and rate theory. Kramers' paper provided a solution for the effect of friction on reaction rates but left us also with some challenges. He could not derive a uniform expression for the rate, valid for all values of the friction coefficient, known as the Kramers turnover problem. He also did not establish the connection between his approach and the TST developed by the chemistry community. For many years, Kramers' theory was considered as providing a dynamic correction to the thermodynamic TST. Both of these questions were resolved in the 1980s when Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 85, 865 (1986)] showed that Kramers' expression in the moderate to strong friction regime could be derived from TST, provided that the bath, which is the source of the friction, is handled at the same level as the system which is observed. This then led to the Mel'nikov-Pollak-Grabert-Hanggi [Mel'nikov and Meshkov, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1018 (1986); Pollak, Grabert, and Hanggi, ibid. 91, 4073 (1989)] solution of the turnover problem posed by Kramers. Although classical rate theory reached a high level of maturity, its quantum analog leaves the theorist with serious challenges to this very day. As noted by Wigner [Trans. Faraday Soc. 34, 29 (1938)], TST is an inherently classical theory. A definite quantum TST has not been formulated to date although some very useful approximate quantum rate theories have been invented. The successes and challenges facing quantum rate theory are outlined. An open problem which is being investigated intensively is rate theory away from equilibrium. TST is no longer valid and cannot even serve as a conceptual guide for understanding the critical factors which determine rates away from equilibrium. The nonequilibrium quantum theory is even less well developed than the classical, and suffers from the fact that even today, we do not know how to solve the real time quantum dynamics for systems with \"many\" degrees of freedom.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

We summarize evidence supporting the idea that a reaction should be viewed as going through a transition region rather than through a single point transition state. A similar conclusion has come out of transition state spectroscopy. We describe this region as a chemically-active, or electronically-intensive, stage of the reaction, while the ones that precede and follow it are structurally-intensive.

Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, considered by many to be the father of TST, never resolved the question as to the definition of the activation energy for which Arrhenius became famous. In 1978, Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 2959 (1978)] finally showed that especially when considering condensed phases, the activation energy is a free energy, it is the barrier height in the potential of mean force felt by the reacting system. Parallel to the development of rate theory in the chemistry community, Kramers published in 1940 [Physica (Amsterdam) 7, 284 (1940)] a seminal paper on the relation between Einstein's theory of Brownian motion [Einstein, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)] and rate theory. Kramers' paper provided a solution for the effect of friction on reaction rates but left us also with some challenges. He could not derive a uniform expression for the rate, valid for all values of the friction coefficient, known as the Kramers turnover problem. He also did not establish the connection between his approach and the TST developed by the chemistry community. For many years, Kramers' theory was considered as providing a dynamic correction to the thermodynamic TST. Both of these questions were resolved in the 1980s when Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 85, 865 (1986)] showed that Kramers' expression in the moderate to strong friction regime could be derived from TST, provided that the bath, which is the source of the friction, is handled at the same level as the system which is observed. This then led to the Mel'nikov-Pollak-Grabert-Hanggi [Mel'nikov and Meshkov, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1018 (1986); Pollak, Grabert, and Hanggi, ibid. 91, 4073 (1989)] solution of the turnover problem posed by Kramers. Although classical rate theory reached a high level of maturity, its quantum analog leaves the theorist with serious challenges to this very day. As noted by Wigner [Trans. Faraday Soc. 34, 29 (1938)], TST is an inherently classical theory. A definite quantum TST has not been formulated to date although some very useful approximate quantum rate theories have been invented. The successes and challenges facing quantum rate theory are outlined. An open problem which is being investigated intensively is rate theory away from equilibrium. TST is no longer valid and cannot even serve as a conceptual guide for understanding the critical factors which determine rates away from equilibrium. The nonequilibrium quantum theory is even less well developed than the classical, and suffers from the fact that even today, we do not know how to solve the real time quantum dynamics for systems with \"many\" degrees of freedom.",

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5).

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction.

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

We first bring basic concepts related to electronic hardness, and then we present an overview of important manifestations of the GMHP for molecular systems such as (i) the tendency of two free radicals to couple, (ii) reduced reactivity of noble gases, (iii) symmetry-breaking distortions related to the Jahn-Teller effect, and/or these connected with (anti)aromatic character of certain organic molecules, (iv) enhanced reactivity of excited states, (v) high-low spin transitions, etc. GMHP is an important qualitative indicator in studies of molecular isomerism and reactivity. Quantitative aspects, traditionally measured by changes of electronic plus nuclear energy, are readily explained by changes of hardness (or polarizability) of a molecular system.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

The results show that in both systems, the interaction between the Cl atom of the ClO radical and the triple and double bonds of C(2)H(2) and C(2)H(4) forms prereaction van der Waals complexes with the O-Cl bond pointing perpendicularly toward the π-bonds, both with 2.1 kcal/mol binding energies.

For the reaction of ClO and C(2)H(2), the main channels are the production of CH(2)CO + Cl (k(1a)) and CHCO + HCl (k(1b)), with k(1a) = 1.19 × 10(-15)T(1.18) exp(-5814/T) and k(1b) = 6.94 × 10(-21) × T(2.60) exp(-6587/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). For the ClO + C(2)H(4) reaction, the main pathway leads to C(2)H(4)O + Cl (k(2a)) with the predicted rate constant k(2a) = 2.13 × 10(-17)T(1.52) exp(-3849/T) in the temperature range of 300-3000 K. These rate constants are pressure-independent below 100 atm.",

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

Other minor mechanisms include direct hydrogen abstraction, which may play a significant role at high temperatures, and a high-barrier S(N)2 displacement. The initial adduct is the CH3OCH2O radical, which has many product channels via decomposition and isomerization. It is confirmed that beta-CH bond cleavage is the dominant product channel and all the remaining processes are of marginal significance. The rate coefficients for the barrierless association of O with CH3OCH2 are calculated to be in the range of (2.23-0.86) x 10(-10) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1) with an apparently negative temperature dependence from 200-2000 K. For the H-atom production channel, the tunneling effect plays an important role and the barrier height is estimated to be 14.2 kcal mol(-1).",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition.

The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

Upper bounds of &lt;10<sup-8</sup cm<sup3</sup s<sup-1</sup were found for the reaction of C<sup+</sup with Br<sup-</sup and I<sup-</sup, and a rate constant of 4.2 ± 1.1 × 10<sup-9</sup cm<sup3</sup s<sup-1</sup was measured for the reaction with Cl<sup-</sup. The C<sup+</sup + Cl<sup-</sup mutual neutralization reaction was studied theoretically from first principles, and a rate constant of 3.9 × 10<sup-10</sup cm<sup3</sup s<sup-1</sup, an order of magnitude smaller than experiment, was obtained with spin-orbit interactions included using a semiempirical model. The discrepancy between the measured and calculated rate constants could be explained by the fact that in the experiment, the total loss of C<sup+</sup ions was measured, while the theoretical treatment did not include the associative ionization channel. The charge transfer was found to take place at small internuclear distances, and the spin-orbit interaction was found to have a minor effect on the rate constant.",

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Three hydrogen abstraction channels and one displacement process are found for the title reaction. The calculation indicates that the hydrogen abstraction from -CH(2)- group is the dominant reaction channel, and the displacement process may be negligible because of the high barrier. The rate constants for individual reaction channels are calculated by the improved canonical variational transition-state theory with small-curvature tunneling correction over the temperature range of 220-1500 K. Our results show that the tunneling correction plays an important role in the rate constant calculation in the low-temperature range. Agreement between the calculated and experimental data available is good. The Arrhenius expression k(T) = 2.33 x 10(-16) T(1.83) exp(-185.01/T) over a wide temperature range is obtained. Furthermore, the kinetic isotope effects for the reaction C(2)H(5)I + Cl are estimated so as to provide theoretical estimation for future laboratory investigation.",

This is due, at least in part, to a widespread failure to recognize that its greatest value may be conceptual rather than numerical, i.e., in achieving insight into molecular properties and behavior. In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous.

In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the electron pair). The octet rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i.e., plausible alternative Lewis structures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for example in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett's double quartet theory.

This maintenance of a dynamic state focuses on conditions where the objects are thermodynamically not very stable and should be rare or virtually inexistent. It does not matter whether they are homochirally enriched populations of chiral molecules, a specific composition of some sort of aggregate, supramolecules, or even a set of chemically relatively unstable molecules that constantly transform one into another. What does matter is that these specific interactions prevail in complex mixtures and eventually grow in numbers and frequency through the enhancing action of autocatalysis, which makes such systems ultimately resemble living cells and interacting living populations. Such chemical systems need to be correctly understood, but also intuitively described. They may be so complex that metaphors become practically more important, as a means of communication, than the precise and correct technical description of chemical models and complex molecular or supramolecular relations. This puts systems chemists on a tightrope walk of science communication, between the complex reality and an imaginative model world. This essay addresses, both, scientists who would like to read \"A Brief History of Systems Chemistry\", that is, about its \"essence\", and systems chemists who work with and communicate complex life-like chemical systems. I illustrate for the external reader a light mantra, that I call \"to make more of it\", and I charily draw systems chemists to reflect upon the fact that chemists are not always good at drawing a clear line between a model and \"the reality\": The real thing.

The techniques were NMR, UV-vis, IR, and Raman spectroscopy, FAB, MALDI, LDI, ESI, and APCI mass spectrometry, HPLC, TGA, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Most of these techniques are shown to give ambiguous or erroneous results, calling into question the composition and/or purity of nearly all C(60)Cl(n) compounds reported to date. The optimum analytical method for chlorofullerenes was found to be a combination of HPLC and either MALDI or APCI mass spectrometry. For the first time, the chlorination of C(60) by ICl, ICl(3), and Cl(2) was studied in detail using dynamic HPLC analysis and APCI mass spectrometry. Suitable conditions were found for the preparation of the new chlorofullerenes 1,7-C(60)Cl(2), 1,9-C(60)Cl(2), 1,6,9,18-C(60)Cl(4), and 1,2,7,10,14,24,25,28,29,31-C(60)Cl(10).

The unusual structure of C(60)Cl(10) was compared with other possible isomers using DFT-predicted relative energies. These results, along with additional experimental data and an analysis of the DFT-predicted frontier orbitals of likely intermediates, were used to rationalize the formation of the new compound C(60)Cl(10) from C(60)Cl(6) and excess ICl without the rearrangement of any C-Cl bonds.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The course of the reactions was followed by (i) monitoring the vapor pressure inside the reactor, (ii) observing the heat dissipation during ClF uptake, and (iii) measuring the volume of the released nitrogen gas. Since the fluorination of the last cyano group proceeds very slowly, the selective synthesis of K[(CF(3))(3)BCN] on a 0.2 molar scale is possible, as well.

The self-assembly of these architectures occurs through the simultaneous creation of more than 25 covalent bonds per molecular entity. It appears that the thermodynamic selection is directed by the packing efficiency of these adducts, explaining the spectacular building block discrimination between homologues differing by one carbon unit. This selectivity, combined with the reversible nature of the system, provided pure molecular building blocks after a simple chemical disconnection, promoting CO(2) as a green auxiliary to purify polyaldehyde or polyamine from mixtures of homologous structures.

The application of this method to the Ugi and Biginelli reactions is described. The condensation products of these two reactions, amino acid amides and dihydropyrimidines, are easily obtained without chromatography in high purities, even though the other reagents are used in very large excesses. This is the first demonstration of the suitability of fluorous phase methods for combinatorial synthesis of \"druglike\" organic molecules.",

Kinetic Evidence for Formation of the Substituted Radical Complex (*)Cr(CO)(2)(H(2)S)C(5)Me(5).\nReaction of a large excess of H(2)S with 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yields HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) and HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5). Kinetic studies of this reaction show two reaction pathways are followed. At pressures of CO above 10-15 atm and temperatures &lt;/=10 degrees C, a third-order rate law d[P]/dt = k(3rd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)](2)[H(2)S] is followed. The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C. As the pressure of CO is reduced, mixed-order kinetics is followed, and under argon atmosphere the reaction obeys the following second-order rate law: d[P]/dt = k(2nd) (order)[(*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5)][H(2)S]. The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Both kinetic and thermodynamic control of the reaction cascade are important, depending upon the conditions. Kinetic control was analyzed by the distortion/interaction model and found to be dictated by differences in distortions of the cycloaddends in the transition states. A new mechanism competing with that originally proposed in the application of these reactions to the histrionicotoxin synthesis was discovered in these studies.",

Earlier, some dispute arose as to which of the three scientists, Carl Wilhelm Scheele (Sweden), Joseph Priestley (United Kingdom) or Antoine Lavoisier (France), should get credit for the air of life.Today it is agreed that the Swede discovered it first, the fire air in 1772. The British chemist published it first, the dephlogisticated air in 1775, and the Frenchman understood it first, the oxygen in 1775-1778. Surely, there is credit enough for all three to split the \"Nobel Prize\" awarded by Carl Djerassi and Roald Hoffmann in their play Oxygen. Molecular oxygen means life. So-called aerobes - these include humans, animals, and plants - need O2 to conserve the energy they have to gain from their environment. Eliminate O2 and these organisms cannot support an active lifestyle. What makes dioxygen that special? It is a non-metal and oxidizing agent that readily reacts with most elements to form compounds, notably oxides. From a biological point of view, the most important compound of course is water, H2O, which provides an excellent solvent for biomolecules. It influences the climate of the Earth, and it is the source of almost all of the molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. ",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books.

The value of k(2nd) (order) was found to be 0.20 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 1 degrees C and 0.30 +/- 0.05 M(-)(1) s(-)(1) at 10 degrees C. This reaction channel is proposed to proceed by rate-determining ligand substitution and formation of the hydrogen sulfide substituted radical complex (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition. The complex HSCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) can react with an additional 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) yielding HCr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) + C(5)Me(5)(CO)(2)Cr=S=Cr(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) + 2CO.

Redox (trace-metal) catalysis also involves the oxidation and reduction of radical intermediates with a metal species which oscillates between several oxidation states (4). The oxidation and reduction of free radicals with metal complexes follow two general mechanisms, electron transfer and ligand transfer. Direct analogy exists with wholly inorganic descriptions of outer-sphere and innersphere processes. In an electron transfer or outersphere mechanism the redox process is derived largely by transfer of an electron from reductant to oxidant, with only indirect contributions from the solvent and ligand. Carbonium ion intermediates and transition states are important considerations, and the scission of the beta-hydrogen bond is minor during oxidation of alkyl radicals to alkenes. In contrast, ligand transfer or inner-sphere mechanism demands maximum involvement of the ligand in the transition state. Free-radical character prevails; cationic contributions from the organic moiety are minimal. Oxidation and reduction are conjugate processes. In an electron transfer mechanism the oxidation of alkyl radicals to carbonium ions is conceptually represented by a microscopic reverse reaction in which a carbonium ion is reduced to an alkyl radical. A similar duality exists in the interconversion of carbanions and free radicals by metal complexes. The reversibility of the ligand transfer process is easier to observe. For example, the chlorine-transfer oxidation of alkyl radicals is represented by a microscopic reverse reduction of alkyl chlorides to alkyl radicals by cuprous chlorides. A ligand transfer counterpart of the reduction of radicals R*+Cu(II)Cl(n)&lt;----&gt;R-Cl+Cu(I)Cl(n-1) can also be described. Hopefully, these simple redox mechanisms will be utilized in rationalizing complex reactions and formulating new syntheses.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

The gas-phase affinity of the anilide ion to CO2 is significantly higher than that of the phenoxide anion (m/z 93), which adds to CO2 only very sluggishly. Our results suggest that the efficacy of CO2 capture depends on the natural charge density on the nitrogen atom, and relative nucleophilicity of the anilide anion. Generally, conjugate bases generated from aniline derivatives with proton affinities (PA) less than 350 kcal/mol do not tend to add CO2 to form gaseous carbamate ions. For example, the anion generated from p-methoxyaniline (PA = 367 kcal/mol) reacts significantly faster than that obtained from p-nitroaniline (PA = 343 kcal/mol). Although deprotonated p-aminobenzoic acid adds very poorly because the negative charge is now located primarily on the carboxylate group, it reacts more efficiently with CO2 if the carboxyl group is esterified. Moreover, mixture of CO2 and He as the collision gas was found to afford more efficient adduct formation than CO2 alone, or as mixtures made with nitrogen or argon, because helium acts as an effective \"cooling\" gas and reduces the internal energy of reactant ions.",

It was shown that the gas-phase reaction of W with CO2 proceeds with a negligible barrier via an insertion pathway, W(7S)+CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta2-OCO)(6A')--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)(1A)--&gt;WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma). This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center.

The local structures, transition structures, and potential-energy surfaces with respect to the reaction coordinates are calculated, and the barriers are compared. In the NCN + NO reaction, out of several adduct structures, only the nitroso adduct NCNNO lies lower in energy than the reactants, by 21.89 kcal/mol; that adduct undergoes rapid transformation into the products, in agreement with experimental observation. For the NS counterpart, both thionitroso NCNNS and thiazyl NCNSN adducts have energies much lower than those of the reactants, by 43 and 29 kcal/mol, respectively, and a five-membered-ring NCNNS (having an energy lower than those of the reactants by 36 kcal/mol) acts as a bridge in connecting these two adducts. The net energy barriers leading to product channels other than p4s are negative for the NS reaction, whereas those for the NO analogue are all positive.

The measurements were carried out in Pyrex reactors using a mixture of CFCl2H, CH4, and Cl2 in either N2 or N2/O2 diluent. Reactants and products were quantified by GC/FID analysis. Cl atoms were generated by irradiation of the mixture with 360 nm light to dissociate the Cl2 for temperatures up to ~550 K. At higher temperature, the Cl2 dissociated thermally, and no irradiation was used. Over the temperature range 298-670 K, k1 is consistently a factor of ~5 smaller than that of k2 with a nearly identical temperature dependence. The optimum non-Arrhenius rate constant is represented by the expression k1 = 1.14 × 10(-22) T(3.49) e(-241/T) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) with an estimated uncertainty of ±15% including uncertainty in the reference reaction. CFCl3 formed from the reaction CFCl2 + Cl2 (k3) is the sole product in N2 diluent. In ~20% O2 at 298 K, the CFCl3 product is suppressed. The rate constant of reaction 3 was measured relative to that of reaction 4 [CFCl2 + O2 (k4)] giving the result k3/k4 = 0.0031 ± 0.0005 at 298 K. An earlier experiment by others observed C(O)FCl to be the major product of reaction channel 4 [formed via the sequence, CFCl2(O2) → CFCl2O → C(O)FCl + Cl]. Our current experiments verified that there is a Cl atom chain reaction in the presence of O2 as required by this mechanism.",

In this work, a historical but contemporary perspective of the discoveries and innovations of the two reactions is given. From a bird's eye view and in a more general sense, the discovery of novel reactions is discussed and how it relates to inventions and innovations.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

However, in recent years, the recognition that Lewis bases can also serve in this capacity has grown enormously. Most importantly, it has become increasingly apparent that the behavior of Lewis bases as agents for promoting chemical reactions is not merely as an electronic complement of the cognate Lewis acids: in fact Lewis bases are capable of enhancing both the electrophilic and nucleophilic character of molecules to which they are bound.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

A prime example are fuel cells, which have undergone five such cycles, but here we discuss a general concept of kinetics-the pre-exponential factor of a rate constant-which has undergone two such cycles. The first cycle was in the 1950-1980s, when the methods of electrochemical kinetics were developed, and the interpretation was based on transition-state theory.

The Fukui potential not only determines the active site for electron transfer, but it also approximates the distribution of hardness of a molecule: it is the Coulomb contribution to the frontier local hardness. The Fukui potential at the position of the nuclei is equal to the variation of the chemical potential with the nuclear charge and therefore measures the sensitivity of the system to changes in atom type. In the specific case of atoms and slightly charged ions, the Fukui potential at the nucleus measures the hardness. The strong correlation between the hardness and the Fukui potential at the nucleus suggests that the Fukui potential at the nucleus is an alternative definition for the chemical hardness.",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

The value of the third-order rate constant 70 +/- 5 M(-)(2) s(-)(1) is essentially independent of temperature in the range -30 to +10 degrees C.

The rate of ligand substitution of (*)Cr(CO)(3)C(5)Me(5) by PMe(2)Ph yielding the phosphine-substituted radical (*)Cr(PMe(2)Ph)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5) has been reinvestigated and shown to have rate constants and activation parameters similar to those proposed for rate-determining formation of (*)Cr(H(2)S)(CO)(2)C(5)Me(5). A reasonable fit to data at intermediate pressures of CO is obtained at T &lt;/= 10 degrees C by combining the 17e(-) second order and 19e(-) third-order mechanisms for oxidative addition.

A comprehensive quantum chemical study, using both density functional theory and semiempirical calculations, revealed that for hard counterions such as NO(3)(-) and ClO(4)(-) the S(ax).X interactions can be understood in terms of an almost entirely electrostatic interaction, whereas for soft nucleophiles such as I(-) and S(2)(-) significant covalency is observed.

Our attempts to generate and detect diazirinone (1) in either the condensed phase (using matrix isolation spectroscopy) or in the gas phase (using millimeter-wave rotational spectroscopy), however, have been unsuccessful. Trapping the volatile products produced from the reaction of 3-chloro-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)diazirine (5) with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) under matrix-isolation conditions affords chlorofluorodiazirine (8) and carbon monoxide but fails to provide evidence for diazirinone (1).

This discrepancy lies well outside any expected solvent shift or calculation error at this level of theory. In an effort to reconcile our findings with the earlier reports concerning diazirinone (1), we reconsidered the infrared spectral evidence upon which the original claim of diazirinone synthesis was based.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The energy profile of plausible reaction paths was evaluated by DFT calculations, and various reaction intermediates were isolated or observed in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that the reaction proceeds in three steps, all promoted by titanium: (1) formation of the enolate ion of methyl acetoacetate, (2) Knoevenagel condensation of the enolate ion and aldehyde, and (3) Michael addition of indole to the Knoevenagel adduct. The study sheds light on the role of titanium in the reaction, providing a mechanistic model for analogous reactions. ",

The breaking of a nearly equidistant hydrogen bond by solvent molecules initiates heterolytic C-C cleavage. The decarboxylation rate decreases with increasing CO(2) partial pressure, proving the competitiveness of protonation and re-carboxylation of the carbanionic intermediate.

Addition of an excess of methyllithium to the sodium salt triggers a reaction sequence comprising a deprotonation, carboxylate transfer, and nucleophilic trapping of the rearranged carboxylate by another equivalent of methyllithium.

The gas-phase affinity of the anilide ion to CO2 is significantly higher than that of the phenoxide anion (m/z 93), which adds to CO2 only very sluggishly. Our results suggest that the efficacy of CO2 capture depends on the natural charge density on the nitrogen atom, and relative nucleophilicity of the anilide anion. Generally, conjugate bases generated from aniline derivatives with proton affinities (PA) less than 350 kcal/mol do not tend to add CO2 to form gaseous carbamate ions. For example, the anion generated from p-methoxyaniline (PA = 367 kcal/mol) reacts significantly faster than that obtained from p-nitroaniline (PA = 343 kcal/mol). Although deprotonated p-aminobenzoic acid adds very poorly because the negative charge is now located primarily on the carboxylate group, it reacts more efficiently with CO2 if the carboxyl group is esterified. Moreover, mixture of CO2 and He as the collision gas was found to afford more efficient adduct formation than CO2 alone, or as mixtures made with nitrogen or argon, because helium acts as an effective \"cooling\" gas and reduces the internal energy of reactant ions.",

Similar correlations are also found with the electronegativity of central atoms in X, deformation energy of the E2 transition state (TS), and the overall enthalpy of reaction. It is revealed that the electronegativity will significantly affect the barrier height, and a more electronegative X will stabilize the E2 and SN2 transition states.

This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center.

The optimum analytical method for chlorofullerenes was found to be a combination of HPLC and either MALDI or APCI mass spectrometry. For the first time, the chlorination of C(60) by ICl, ICl(3), and Cl(2) was studied in detail using dynamic HPLC analysis and APCI mass spectrometry. Suitable conditions were found for the preparation of the new chlorofullerenes 1,7-C(60)Cl(2), 1,9-C(60)Cl(2), 1,6,9,18-C(60)Cl(4), and 1,2,7,10,14,24,25,28,29,31-C(60)Cl(10). The latter compound was also studied by (13)C NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, which led to the unambiguous determination of its asymmetric addition pattern. The unusual structure of C(60)Cl(10) was compared with other possible isomers using DFT-predicted relative energies. These results, along with additional experimental data and an analysis of the DFT-predicted frontier orbitals of likely intermediates, were used to rationalize the formation of the new compound C(60)Cl(10) from C(60)Cl(6) and excess ICl without the rearrangement of any C-Cl bonds. For the first time, the stability of C(60)Cl(n) compounds under a variety of conditions was studied in detail, leading to the discovery that they are, in general, very light-sensitive in solution. The X-ray structure of C(60)Cl(6) was also redetermined with higher precision.",

The structures of reactants, intermediates, products, and transition states were optimized at the MPW1PW91/6-311+G(3df,2p) level of theory, and the potential energy surface of each reaction was refined at the G2M and CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,2p) levels of theory. The most favorable reaction channels are predicted to be Cl-abstraction in HOCl + ClO with a barrier of 18.5 kcal/mol and H abstraction in HOCl + OClO with a barrier of 23.9 kcal/mol. In the HOCl + ClO(3) reaction both processes can occur; the barriers of Cl and H abstraction are 16.4 and 17.1 kcal/mol, respectively. In the HOCl + ClO(4) reaction, the H abstraction transition state lies below that of the reactants by 1.4 kcal/mol. The rate constants for all low barrier channels have been calculated in the temperature range 200-3000 K by statistical theory.

The overall reaction is exothermic by 18.8 kcal/mol and proceeds via precomplexation of the CO(2) (necessary for activation). The reaction barrier is calculated to be 11.9 kcal/mol (relative to the precomplex 2a) and represents a lower boundary for the activation energy. The reaction barrier is shown to originate from specific solvent effects. A detailed survey of the electronic effects governing the reaction is given. The ab initio results were then compared with semiempirical PM3 calculations, which were extended to include the heterocumulenes COS and CS(2). As expected, the reduced electrophilicity of these molecules leads to a higher activation barrier by retention of the same reaction mechanism.",
