This interaction accounts for the observed overall nucleophilic character and electrophilic character of the alkene and peracid, respectively.

Thus if the molecule is in the ground state it will proceed through the conrotatory mechanism (i.e. under thermal control) to avoid an electronic barrier. However, if the molecule is in the first excited state (i.e. under photochemical control), the electronic barrier is present in the conrotatory mechanism and the reaction will proceed through the disrotatory mechanism. These are not completely distinct as both the conrotatory and disrotatory mechanisms lie on the same potential surface. Thus a more correct statement is that as a ground state molecule explores the potential energy surface, it is more likely to achieve the activation barrier to undergo a conrotatory mechanism.

Since the early 1950s, it had been postulated by many that the TDR mechanism involved a carbonium ion. However, a major breakthrough in the development of the TDR mechanism came with the improved understanding of the phenomenon behind amine groups reacting with nitrous acid. Meticulous kinetic studies throughout the late 1950s led scientists to believe that nitrous acid reacts with an amine by first producing a nitrous acid derivative, potentially N2O3. While this derivative would prove incorrect as it relates to TDR, scientists of the time still correctly came to the conclusion that the derivative would react with the amine to produce the diazonium ion. The inferred instability of this diazonium ion gave solid evidence for the existence of a carbocation in the TDR mechanism.",

Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

In 1894, Link, a German chemist, had published the reaction in Chemisches Zentralblatt and patented it. However, he wrote the product was either a ketone or a phenol, specifically he claimed it was a \"hydrpxyphenyl hydroxyisopropyl keton\" or \"hydroxyisobutyrylphenol.\" When Bargellini conducted the same experiment and began testing the product, the chemical properties could not be from a ketone or a phenol.

Formed by removing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH, producing an anion, which joins with a cation forming a salt. For example, the sodium benzoate is an ionic compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O− Na+, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5CO2Na. The suffix comes from \"-oic acid\".

Classification Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus.

Classification Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus. Another distinction, based on the size of organic compounds, distinguishes between small molecules and polymers.",

Carbenium ions are generally highly reactive due to having an incomplete octet of electrons; however, certain carbenium ions, such as the tropylium ion, are relatively stable due to the positive charge being delocalised between the carbon atoms.

Somehow, Couper realised that carbon can form four bonds, thereby attaching itself with different strengths to other carbon atoms in a compound: In diamond all four bonds are connected to other carbon atoms in three-dimensions, making it so hard. In graphite only three bonds are connected to other carbon atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, allowing layers to slide over each other, making graphite soft.",

In turn, integration with respect to time implies that likewise takes on an approximately constant value through the course of the reaction, namely . In terms of the ground state and transition state energies, the product ratio can therefore be written as: .

The distinction is relevant when product A forms faster than product B because the activation energy for product A is lower than that for product B, yet product B is more stable. In such a case A is the kinetic product and is favoured under kinetic control and B is the thermodynamic product and is favoured under thermodynamic control.

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

In the process, the catalyst is regenerated. In principle, often only small amounts of catalysts are required to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes slow or are even consumed in secondary processes. The catalyst does often appear in the rate equation. As a simple example in the gas phase, the reaction 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3 can be catalyzed by adding nitric oxide. The reaction mechanism occurs in two steps: 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2 (slow) NO2 + SO2 → NO + SO3 (fast, twice) The overall reaction is the first equation plus twice the second reaction, so that the NO catalyst is regenerated and does not participate in the net reaction. The overall rate is the rate of the slow step v = 2k1[NO]2[O2].",

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

No decade has gone by without an important addition or twist of the reaction taking place. In the author's own words, \"The first phase in the reaction is probably the formation of acetonechloroform--(which may, indeed, be used in place of the chloroform), this being then acted on by sodium hydroxide in presence of acetone, yielding α-hydroxyisobutyric acid, which, with the phenol, gives α-phenoxyisobutyric acid. The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that. One hundred years later, the Bargellini reaction itself was used for the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and his own named reaction produced it.

Werner proposed that these are two geometric isomers of formula [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl, with one Cl− ion dissociated as confirmed by conductivity measurements. The Co atom is surrounded by four NH3 and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices. Werner also prepared complexes with optical isomers, and in 1914 he reported the first synthetic chiral compound lacking carbon, known as hexol with formula [Co(Co(NH3)4(OH)2)3]Br6.",

When R = OCH2CH3, the rate of the reaction is the fastest because the reaction has the smallest energy of activation (ΔG‡). The ethoxy and cyano groups are able to delocalize the radical ion in the transition state, thus stabilizing the radical center. The rate enhancement is due to the captodative effect. When R = H, the reaction has the largest energy of activation because the radical center is not stabilized by the captodative effect. The hydrogen atom is not able to delocalize the radical ion. Thus, the reaction is slow relative to the R = OCH2CH3 case. When R = CH3, the rate of the reaction is faster relative to when R = H because methyl groups have more electron donating capability. However, the reaction rate is slower relative to when R = OCH2CH3 because the radical ion is not delocalized over the methyl group . Thus, the captodative does not influence the reaction",

Formed by removing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH, producing an anion, which joins with a cation forming a salt.

The Co atom is surrounded by four NH3 and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices.

The chemistry forms the basis for olefin metathesis, and Schrock ultimately shared the Nobel Prize with Robert Grubbs, a CRD consultant, for the metathesis work. Anthony Arduengo’s persistent carbenes opened up a new area of chemistry and they have proven to be important ligands in the metathesis process. There was a vigorous effort on the activation of C-H bonds with contributions by Parshall, Thomas Herskovitz, Ittel, and David Thorn.

Several reviews have been published. It is named after the German chemist Karl Heinz Dötz (b. 1943) and the American chemist William D. Wulff (b. 1949) at Michigan State University. The reaction was first discovered by Karl Dötz and was extensively developed by his group and W. Wulff's group. They subsequently share the name of the reaction. The position of the substituents is highly predictable with the largest alkyne substituent (RL) neighboring the phenol and the smallest alkyne substituent (RS) neighboring the methoxy group. Hence, this reaction is more useful for terminal alkynes than internal alkynes.",

Mechanism and applications The reaction mechanism involves an intramolecular 5-membered cyclic transition state, leading to a syn elimination product, an Ei pathway. This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group. The amine oxide is prepared by oxidation of the corresponding amine with an oxidant such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). The actual elimination just requires heat. Illustrative of the Cope reaction is a synthesis of methylenecyclohexane: Piperidines are resistant to an intramolecular Cope reaction but with pyrrolidine and with rings of size 7 and larger, the reaction product is an unsaturated hydroxyl amine. This result is consistent with the 5-membered cyclic transition state.",

Prior to the Wöhler synthesis, the work of John Dalton and Jöns Jacob Berzelius had already convinced chemists that organic and inorganic matter obey the same chemical laws. It took until 1845 when Kolbe reported another inorganic – organic conversion (of carbon disulfide to acetic acid) before vitalism started to lose support.

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

Proposed by Andrzej Stanislaw Cieplak in 1980, it predicts anomalous results that other models of the time, such as the Cram and Felkin–Anh models, cannot justify. In the Cieplak model, electrons from a neighboring bond delocalize into the forming carbon–nucleophile (C–Nuc) bond, lowering the energy of the transition state and accelerating the rate of reaction. Whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the C–Nuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to. The nucleophile may be a number of reagents, most commonly organometallic or reducing agents. The Cieplak effect is subtle, and often competes with sterics, solvent effects, counterion complexation of the carbonyl oxygen, and other effects to determine product distribution. Subsequent work has questioned its legitimacy (see Criticisms).",

Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2.

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

This formed the basis of his liquid drop model and later provided a theory base for nuclear fission after its discovery by chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman, and explanation and naming by physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.",

These electron pairs are known as shared pairs or bonding pairs, and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is known as covalent bonding. For many molecules, the sharing of electrons allows each atom to attain the equivalent of a full valence shell, corresponding to a stable electronic configuration. In organic chemistry, covalent bonds are much more common than ionic bonds. Covalent bonding also includes many kinds of interactions, including σ-bonding, π-bonding, metal-to-metal bonding, agostic interactions, bent bonds, three-center two-electron bonds and three-center four-electron bonds. The term covalent bond dates from 1939. The prefix co- means jointly, associated in action, partnered to a lesser degree, etc.; thus a \"co-valent bond\", in essence, means that the atoms share \"valence\", such as is discussed in valence bond theory.",

Moreover, this definition still leads to somewhat arbitrary divisions in sets of carbon-halogen compounds. For example, CF4 and CCl4 would be considered by this rule to be \"inorganic\", whereas CF3H, CHCl3, and C2Cl6 would be organic, though these compounds share many physical and chemical properties. Classification Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus. Another distinction, based on the size of organic compounds, distinguishes between small molecules and polymers.",

Marvel worked with a wide variety of compounds, including dialkyl mercury, hexa-substituted ethanes, dienynes, alkyl lithium and Grignard reagents, quaternary phosphonium, and ammonium compounds, preparing them and investigating their reactions. He developed organic chemical reagents to be used in the characterization, identification, and analysis of chemical compounds. Much of this research was carried out before techniques such as Infrared spectroscopy or Mass spectrometry were developed: for example, Marvel's exploration of intermolecular hydrogen bonding relied on studying solubilities and heats of mixing.",

The chemistry forms the basis for olefin metathesis, and Schrock ultimately shared the Nobel Prize with Robert Grubbs, a CRD consultant, for the metathesis work. Anthony Arduengo’s persistent carbenes opened up a new area of chemistry and they have proven to be important ligands in the metathesis process. There was a vigorous effort on the activation of C-H bonds with contributions by Parshall, Thomas Herskovitz, Ittel, and David Thorn. Chad Tolman developed his “ligand cone angle” theory that developed into the widely accepted electronic and steric effects of ligands on inorganic and organometallic complexes.",

In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810.

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

For example, a rate law of the form represents concurrent first order and second order reactions (or more often concurrent pseudo-first order and second order) reactions, and can be described as mixed first and second order. For sufficiently large values of [A] such a reaction will approximate second order kinetics, but for smaller [A] the kinetics will approximate first order (or pseudo-first order). As the reaction progresses, the reaction can change from second order to first order as reactant is consumed.",

Catchpole independently described a thermodynamic and kinetic reaction control model in 1948. They were reinvestigating a certain allylic rearrangement reported in 1930 by Jakob Meisenheimer. Solvolysis of gamma-phenylallyl chloride with AcOK in acetic acid was found to give a mixture of the gamma and the alpha acetate with the latter converting to the first by equilibration. This was interpreted as a case in the field of anionotropy of the phenomenon, familiar in prototropy, of the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control in ion-recombination.

During a chemical reaction reactants are transformed into products after passing through a high energy transition state. This process results in the consumption of the reactants. It can be a spontaneous reaction or mediated by catalysts which lower the energy of the transition state, and by solvents which provide the chemical environment necessary for the reaction to take place. When represented in chemical equations products are by convention drawn on the right-hand side, even in the case of reversible reactions. The properties of products such as their energies help determine several characteristics of a chemical reaction such as whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic. Additionally the properties of a product can make it easier to extract and purify following a chemical reaction, especially if the product has a different state of matter than the reactants.

Debate It is disputed that Wöhler's synthesis sparked the downfall of the theory of vitalism, which states that organic matter possessed a certain vital force common to all living things. Prior to the Wöhler synthesis, the work of John Dalton and Jöns Jacob Berzelius had already convinced chemists that organic and inorganic matter obey the same chemical laws. It took until 1845 when Kolbe reported another inorganic – organic conversion (of carbon disulfide to acetic acid) before vitalism started to lose support. A 2000 survey found that 90% of chemical textbooks repeat some version of the Wöhler myth. References Name reactions Organic reactions",

When R = OCH2CH3, the rate of the reaction is the fastest because the reaction has the smallest energy of activation (ΔG‡). The ethoxy and cyano groups are able to delocalize the radical ion in the transition state, thus stabilizing the radical center. The rate enhancement is due to the captodative effect. When R = H, the reaction has the largest energy of activation because the radical center is not stabilized by the captodative effect. The hydrogen atom is not able to delocalize the radical ion. Thus, the reaction is slow relative to the R = OCH2CH3 case. When R = CH3, the rate of the reaction is faster relative to when R = H because methyl groups have more electron donating capability. However, the reaction rate is slower relative to when R = OCH2CH3 because the radical ion is not delocalized over the methyl group . Thus, the captodative does not influence the reaction",

The Co atom is surrounded by four NH3 and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices.

The Co atom is surrounded by four NH3 and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices. Werner also prepared complexes with optical isomers, and in 1914 he reported the first synthetic chiral compound lacking carbon, known as hexol with formula [Co(Co(NH3)4(OH)2)3]Br6.",

For example, methyl benzoate is a molecular compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O–CH3, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5COOCH3. Formed by removing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH, producing an anion, which joins with a cation forming a salt. For example, the sodium benzoate is an ionic compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O− Na+, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5CO2Na. The suffix comes from \"-oic acid\".

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

Berzelius was among the first to articulate the differences between inorganic compounds and organic compounds. Among the many minerals and elements he studied, he is credited with discovering cerium and selenium, and with being the first to isolate silicon and thorium.

Although Proust proved his theory by accurate measurements, his theory was not immediately accepted partially due to Berthollet's authority.

Teaching One of McBay's main goals was to pass along his love for chemistry to his students. He regularly demonstrated how two materials could be combined to produce something with completely different properties. One of his frequent demonstrations combined a metallic poison, sodium, with a gaseous poison, chlorine, to produce table salt. He wanted his students to share his fascination with such processes, which he believed to be minor miracles.",

The convention had reverted to defining the atomic mass of hydrogen as 1, although at the level of precision of measurements at that time – relative uncertainties of around 1% – this was numerically equivalent to the later standard of oxygen = 16. However the chemical convenience of having oxygen as the primary atomic mass standard became ever more evident with advances in analytical chemistry and the need for ever more accurate atomic mass determinations.",

He also performed numerous investigations with an air pump, and noted that the mercury fell as air was pumped out. He also observed that pumping the air out of a container would extinguish a flame and kill small animals placed inside.

When Watt returned to Britain, he began experiments along these lines with hopes of finding a commercially viable process. He discovered that a mixture of salt, manganese dioxide and sulphuric acid could produce chlorine, which Watt believed might be a cheaper method. He passed the chlorine into a weak solution of alkali, and obtained a turbid solution that appeared to have good bleaching properties.

For example, he explained the existence of two tetrammine isomers, \"Co(NH3)4Cl3\", one green and one purple. Werner proposed that these are two geometric isomers of formula [Co(NH3)4Cl2]Cl, with one Cl− ion dissociated as confirmed by conductivity measurements. The Co atom is surrounded by four NH3 and two Cl ligands at the vertices of an octahedron. The green isomer is \"trans\" with the two Cl ligands at opposite vertices, and the purple is \"cis\" with the two Cl at adjacent vertices. Werner also prepared complexes with optical isomers, and in 1914 he reported the first synthetic chiral compound lacking carbon, known as hexol with formula [Co(Co(NH3)4(OH)2)3]Br6.",

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

The Dean-Stark trap does involve returning some distillate to the reaction flask: a solution is distilled and the condensed liquid is collected in a tube wherein water settles to the bottom and is drained out, while an organic solvent returns to the boiling solution. However, the process is not manual, most of the solvent does not leave the reaction flask, and the apparatus achieves a useful purpose (removing water from the reaction mixture).

By adding a correction factor, known as the activity (, the activity of the ith component) to the liquid phase fraction of a liquid mixture, some of the effects of the real solution can be accounted for. The activity of a real chemical is a function of the thermodynamic state of the system, i.e. temperature and pressure.",

The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.",

The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.",

An elementary reaction involves a few molecules, usually one or two, because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time. The most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis–trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.",

The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

Associated with the figures are several terms derived from Ceva's name: cevian (the lines AD, BE, CF are the cevians of O), cevian triangle (the triangle DEF is the cevian triangle of O); cevian nest, anticevian triangle, Ceva conjugate.

Even for the simple case of adding natural numbers, there are many possible interpretations and even more visual representations. Combining sets Possibly the most fundamental interpretation of addition lies in combining sets: When two or more disjoint collections are combined into a single collection, the number of objects in the single collection is the sum of the numbers of objects in the original collections. This interpretation is easy to visualize, with little danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics (for the rigorous definition it inspires, see below). However, it is not obvious how one should extend this version of addition to include fractional numbers or negative numbers.",

Prior to the Wöhler synthesis, the work of John Dalton and Jöns Jacob Berzelius had already convinced chemists that organic and inorganic matter obey the same chemical laws. It took until 1845 when Kolbe reported another inorganic – organic conversion (of carbon disulfide to acetic acid) before vitalism started to lose support.

Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810.

Formed by removing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH, producing an anion, which joins with a cation forming a salt. For example, the sodium benzoate is an ionic compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O− Na+, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5CO2Na. The suffix comes from \"-oic acid\".

Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus.

The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically feasible, and has experimental support in isolated intermediates (see next section) or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. It also describes each reactive intermediate, activated complex, and transition state, and which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the reactants and catalyst used, the stereochemistry observed in reactants and products, all products formed and the amount of each.",

In organic synthesis B and C from the above equations usually represent different compounds. However, they could also just be different positions in the same molecule. A side reaction is also referred to as competing reaction when different compounds (B, C) compete for another reactant (A). If the side reaction occurs about as often as the main reaction, it is spoken of parallel reactions (especially in the kinetics, see below).",

The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.",

Put another way, If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, temperature or total pressure, the equilibrium will shift in order to minimize that change. This qualitative law enables one to envision the displacement of equilibrium of a chemical reaction. For example: a change in concentration of a reaction in equilibrium for the following equation: N2(g) + 3H2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g) If one increases the pressure of the reactants, the reaction will tend to move towards the products to decrease the pressure of the reaction.

Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [2+2] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light.

This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group. The amine oxide is prepared by oxidation of the corresponding amine with an oxidant such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). The actual elimination just requires heat. Illustrative of the Cope reaction is a synthesis of methylenecyclohexane: Piperidines are resistant to an intramolecular Cope reaction but with pyrrolidine and with rings of size 7 and larger, the reaction product is an unsaturated hydroxyl amine. This result is consistent with the 5-membered cyclic transition state.",

If mineral acid is added to the acetic acid mixture, increasing the concentration of hydronium ion, the amount of dissociation must decrease as the reaction is driven to the left in accordance with this principle. This can also be deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction: If {H3O+} increases {CH3CO2H} must increase and must decrease.

He pays a visit to Master Ye, who, as it turns out, was offended when Bruce created Jeet Kune Do. He felt that Bruce was being arrogant and disrespectful. Bruce assures Master Ye that Jeet Kune Do is a practical style of fighting that owes much to Master Ye's Yong Chun Quan. George once again comes to Bruce with a television project. Still wary of another deception, Bruce meets George with skepticism. However, George gives him a contract and a $2000 deposit upfront. This removes Bruce's doubts and he agrees to work on the TV series The Green Hornet as Kato. The Green Hornet turns into a hit series and a second season is promised, but Mr. William decides to discontinue the show.",

Only his most complex experiment, which took place in 1982 and is the closest to the initial specifications, will be described here. Photon source The first experiments testing Bell's inequalities possessed low-intensity photon sources and necessitated a continuous week to complete. One of Alain Aspect's first improvements consisted in using a photon source several orders of magnitude more efficient. This source allowed a detection rate of 100 photons per second, thus shortening the length of the experiment to 100 seconds. The source used is a calcium radiative cascade, excited with a krypton laser.",

In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810.

If a dynamic equilibrium is disturbed by changing the conditions, the position of equilibrium moves to partially reverse the change. For example, adding more S from the outside will cause an excess of products, and the system will try to counteract this by increasing the reverse reaction and pushing the equilibrium point backward (though the equilibrium constant will stay the same). If mineral acid is added to the acetic acid mixture, increasing the concentration of hydronium ion, the amount of dissociation must decrease as the reaction is driven to the left in accordance with this principle. This can also be deduced from the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction: If {H3O+} increases {CH3CO2H} must increase and must decrease. The H2O is left out, as it is the solvent and its concentration remains high and nearly constant.",

He believed that salts are compounds formed of acids and bases, and discovered that the anions in acids were attracted to a positive electrode (the anode), whereas the cations in a base were attracted to a negative electrode (the cathode). Berzelius did not believe in the Vitalism Theory, but instead in a regulative force which produced organization of tissues in an organism. Berzelius is also credited with originating the chemical terms \"catalysis\", \"polymer\", \"isomer\", and \"allotrope\", although his original definitions differ dramatically from modern usage. For example, he coined the term \"polymer\" in 1833 to describe organic compounds which shared identical empirical formulas but which differed in overall molecular weight, the larger of the compounds being described as \"polymers\" of the smallest.

Boyle argued that matter's basic elements consisted of various sorts and sizes of particles, called \"corpuscles\", which were capable of arranging themselves into groups. In 1680, using the corpuscular theory as a basis, French chemist Nicolas Lemery stipulated that the acidity of any substance consisted in its pointed particles, while alkalis were endowed with pores of various sizes. A molecule, according to this view, consisted of corpuscles united through a geometric locking of points and pores. 18th century",

Moreover, this definition still leads to somewhat arbitrary divisions in sets of carbon-halogen compounds. For example, CF4 and CCl4 would be considered by this rule to be \"inorganic\", whereas CF3H, CHCl3, and C2Cl6 would be organic, though these compounds share many physical and chemical properties. Classification Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus. Another distinction, based on the size of organic compounds, distinguishes between small molecules and polymers.",

Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms.",

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

For example, the diagram illustrates how to add 150° to 270°. The answer should be , but when thinking in terms of the circle group, we need to \"forget\" the fact that we have wrapped once around the circle. Therefore, we adjust our answer by 360° which gives ). Another description is in terms of ordinary addition, where only numbers between 0 and 1 are allowed (with 1 corresponding to a full rotation). To achieve this, we might need to throw away digits occurring before the decimal point. For example, when we work out , the answer should be 2.155, but we throw away the leading 2, so the answer (in the circle group) is just 0.155.",

Most chemists relied on the familiar thermodynamics of heat (enthalpy) of Berthelot, Ostwald, and Van’t Hoff, and the calorimetric school. Heat of reaction is not, of course, a measure of the tendency of chemical changes to occur, and Lewis realized that only free energy and entropy could provide an exact chemical thermodynamics. He derived free energy from fugacity; he tried, without success, to obtain an exact expression for the entropy function, which in 1901 had not been defined at low temperatures. Richards too tried and failed, and not until Nernst succeeded in 1907 was it possible to calculate entropies unambiguously. Although Lewis’ fugacity-based system did not last,",

In linear synthesis the overall yield quickly drops with each reaction step: A → B → C → D Suppose the yield is 50% for each reaction; the overall yield of D is only 12.5% from A. In a convergent synthesis A → B (50%) C → D (50%) B + D → E (25%) the overall yield of E (25%) looks much better. Convergent synthesis is applied in the synthesis of complex molecules and involves fragment coupling and independent synthesis.

The values are usually stated for reactions with the same initial and final temperatures and pressures (while conditions are allowed to vary during the course of the reactions). Hess's law can be used to determine the overall energy required for a chemical reaction that can be divided into synthetic steps that are individually easier to characterize.

This interpretation is easy to visualize, with little danger of ambiguity. It is also useful in higher mathematics (for the rigorous definition it inspires, see below).

The chemical substance index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition. Non-stoichiometric compounds are a special case (in inorganic chemistry) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, as in the case of palladium hydride. Broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found, for example: \"the term 'chemical substance' means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including – (i) any combination of",

The ratio of each element in the compound is expressed in a ratio in its chemical formula.

Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions. Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more thermal energy available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms.",

Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

Mechanism and applications The reaction mechanism involves an intramolecular 5-membered cyclic transition state, leading to a syn elimination product, an Ei pathway. This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group. The amine oxide is prepared by oxidation of the corresponding amine with an oxidant such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). The actual elimination just requires heat. Illustrative of the Cope reaction is a synthesis of methylenecyclohexane: Piperidines are resistant to an intramolecular Cope reaction but with pyrrolidine and with rings of size 7 and larger, the reaction product is an unsaturated hydroxyl amine. This result is consistent with the 5-membered cyclic transition state.",

Classification Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus.

No decade has gone by without an important addition or twist of the reaction taking place.

The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that. One hundred years later, the Bargellini reaction itself was used for the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and his own named reaction produced it.

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

For example, in the reaction of aryldiazonium ions with nucleophiles in aqueous solution ArN2+ + X− → ArX + N2, the rate equation is v = k[ArN2+], where Ar indicates an aryl group. Second order A reaction is said to be second order when the overall order is two. The rate of a second-order reaction may be proportional to one concentration squared , or (more commonly) to the product of two concentrations . As an example of the first type, the reaction NO2 + CO → NO + CO2 is second-order in the reactant NO2 and zero order in the reactant CO.

Classification Organic compounds may be classified in a variety of ways. One major distinction is between natural and synthetic compounds. Organic compounds can also be classified or subdivided by the presence of heteroatoms, e.g., organometallic compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a metal, and organophosphorus compounds, which feature bonds between carbon and a phosphorus. Another distinction, based on the size of organic compounds, distinguishes between small molecules and polymers.",

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

For example, ethane consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, with each carbon atom having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH3CH3. In ethylene there is a double bond between the carbon atoms (and thus each carbon only has two hydrogens), therefore the chemical formula may be written: CH2CH2, and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is implicit because carbon has a valence of four. However, a more explicit method is to write H2C=CH2 or less commonly H2C::CH2. The two lines (or two pairs of dots) indicate that a double bond connects the atoms on either side of them.",

The 1.5 L formula was short-lived, with Formula Junior effectively replacing first Formula Three and then Formula Two until 1963—but the 1961 1.5 L Formula One was effectively a continuation of this Formula Two. For 1960, in preparation for the new Formula One, two international championships were held, the Formula Two Constructors' Championship and the Formula Two Drivers' Championship. The Drivers' championship was won by Jack Brabham, while the Manufacturers' championship ended in a tie between Porsche and Cooper.",

In the Cieplak model, electrons from a neighboring bond delocalize into the forming carbon–nucleophile (C–Nuc) bond, lowering the energy of the transition state and accelerating the rate of reaction. Whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the C–Nuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to. The nucleophile may be a number of reagents, most commonly organometallic or reducing agents. The Cieplak effect is subtle, and often competes with sterics, solvent effects, counterion complexation of the carbonyl oxygen, and other effects to determine product distribution.

Mechanism and applications The reaction mechanism involves an intramolecular 5-membered cyclic transition state, leading to a syn elimination product, an Ei pathway. This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group. The amine oxide is prepared by oxidation of the corresponding amine with an oxidant such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). The actual elimination just requires heat. Illustrative of the Cope reaction is a synthesis of methylenecyclohexane: Piperidines are resistant to an intramolecular Cope reaction but with pyrrolidine and with rings of size 7 and larger, the reaction product is an unsaturated hydroxyl amine. This result is consistent with the 5-membered cyclic transition state.",

Secondary task reaction time (STRT) is a measure of the amount of resources allocated to attention. STRT involves people engaging in a primary task such as watching TV while also monitoring a second task such as pressing a button whenever a cue such as a tone sounds or a light comes on. The amount of resources that are available (i.e., resources allocated minus resources required) has been demonstrated to influence how long it takes people to respond in the STRT. When there are a lot of resources available, people quickly notice the light or tone and are quick to press a button. But when resources are low or taxed, people take longer to notice the light or tone and are slower to respond. For example, a cut to an unrelated scene tends to tax resources because of the new information that needs to be processed, and STRT is slower. Critically, STRT is a function",

Using other common oxidants in the place of PCC usually leads to dehydration, because such alcohols cannot be oxidized directly. Other reactions PCC also converts suitable unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes to cyclohexenones.

In the next step a bisulfite anion adds to C3 through 1e. This results in the formation of 3a which tautomerizes to the more stable 3b to the sulfonic acid of tetralone. A nucleophilic addition follows of the amine with formation of 4a and its tautomer 4b loses water to form the resonance stabilized cation 5a. This compound is deprotonated to the imine 5b or the enamine 5c but an equilibrium exists between both species. The enamine eliminates sodium bisulfite with formation of naphthylamine 6.

When R = OCH2CH3, the rate of the reaction is the fastest because the reaction has the smallest energy of activation (ΔG‡). The ethoxy and cyano groups are able to delocalize the radical ion in the transition state, thus stabilizing the radical center. The rate enhancement is due to the captodative effect. When R = H, the reaction has the largest energy of activation because the radical center is not stabilized by the captodative effect. The hydrogen atom is not able to delocalize the radical ion. Thus, the reaction is slow relative to the R = OCH2CH3 case. When R = CH3, the rate of the reaction is faster relative to when R = H because methyl groups have more electron donating capability. However, the reaction rate is slower relative to when R = OCH2CH3 because the radical ion is not delocalized over the methyl group . Thus, the captodative does not influence the reaction",

This followed from a simple application of the likelihood principle: if the outcome of an experiment is to be only reported in a form of a \"accept\"/\"reject\" decision, then the overall procedure is equivalent to an experiment that has only two possible outcomes, with probabilities , and , under . The likelihood ratio associated with the outcome \"reject \" is therefore and hence should determine the evidential interpretation of this result. (Since, for a test of two simple hypotheses, the likelihood ratio is a compact representation of the likelihood function). On the other hand, if the likelihood principle is to be followed consistently, then the likelihood ratio of the original outcome should be used and not , making the basis of such an interpretation questionable.

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction.

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

Molecularity Molecularity in chemistry is the number of colliding molecular entities that are involved in a single reaction step. A reaction step involving one molecular entity is called unimolecular. A reaction step involving two molecular entities is called bimolecular. A reaction step involving three molecular entities is called trimolecular or termolecular. In general, reaction steps involving more than three molecular entities do not occur, because is statistically improbable in terms of Maxwell distribution to find such transition state.

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system. A truly irreversible chemical reaction is usually achieved when one of the products exits the reacting system, for example, as does carbon dioxide (volatile) in the reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2↑ History",

Reactive intermediates or other unstable high energy intermediates are not involved. Concerted reaction rates tend not to depend on solvent polarity ruling out large buildup of charge in the transition state. The reaction is said to progress through a concerted mechanism as all bonds are formed and broken in concert. Pericyclic reactions, the SN2 reaction, and some rearrangements - such as the Claisen rearrangement - are concerted reactions. The rate of the SN2 reaction is second order overall due to the reaction being bimolecular (i.e. there are two molecular species involved in the rate-determining step). The reaction does not have any intermediate steps, only a transition state. This means that all the bond making and bond breaking takes place in a single step.

This derivative is called the reaction Gibbs energy (or energy change) and corresponds to the difference between the chemical potentials of reactants and products at the composition of the reaction mixture.

Pericyclic reactions stand in contrast to linear reactions, encompassing most organic transformations and proceeding through an acyclic transition state, on the one hand and coarctate reactions, which proceed through a doubly cyclic, concerted transition state on the other hand. Pericyclic reactions are usually rearrangement or addition reactions. The major classes of pericyclic reactions are given in the table below (the three most important classes are shown in bold). Ene reactions and cheletropic reactions are often classed as group transfer reactions and cycloadditions/cycloeliminations, respectively, while dyotropic reactions and group transfer reactions (if ene reactions are excluded) are",

Using other common oxidants in the place of PCC usually leads to dehydration, because such alcohols cannot be oxidized directly. Other reactions PCC also converts suitable unsaturated alcohols and aldehydes to cyclohexenones. This pathway, an oxidative cationic cyclization, is illustrated by the conversion of (−)-citronellol to (−)-pulegone. PCC also effects allylic oxidations, for example, in conversion of dihydrofurans to furanones. Related reagents",

In a more general description the RC reaction is any coupling of one active alkene / latent enolate to a second Michael acceptor, creating a new C–C bond between the alpha-position of one activated alkene and the beta-position of a second alkene under the influence of a nucleophilic catalyst. The reaction mechanism is essentially that of the related and better known Baylis–Hillman reaction (DABCO not phosphine, carbonyl not enone) but the Rauhut–Currier reaction actually predates it by several years. In comparison to the MBH reaction, the RC reaction lacks substrate reactivity and regioselectivity.",

General Reaction Scheme The reaction scheme below shows the synthesis of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline from benzaldehyde and 2,2-diethylethylamine. Reaction Mechanism A possible mechanism is depicted below: First the benzaliminoacetal 3 is built by the condensation of benzaldehyde 1 and 2,2-diethylethylamine 2. After the condensation the C=N-double bond in 3 is hydrogenated to form 4. Subsequently, an ethanol is removed. Next, the compound 5 is built including the cyclization step. After that the C=C-double bond in 5 is hydrogenated . Thus, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 6 is formed.",

He provided many more resolved formulas in his paper than Kekulé had, and in two cases even suggested (hetero)cyclical formulas, which could have influenced Kekulé in his later suggestion of the benzene ring. Couper adopted the atomic weight of oxygen as 8 rather than 16, so there are twice as many oxygen atoms in Couper's formulas as in those of Kekulé. Finally, Couper used dotted lines or dashes between the atoms in his formulas, approximating the appearance of later formula styles. In this respect, his work was probably influential on the early structural theorists Aleksandr Butlerov and Alexander Crum Brown. See also History of the molecule References",

In this type of synthesis several individual pieces of a complex molecule are synthesized in stage one, and then in stage two these pieces are combined to form the final product. In linear synthesis the overall yield quickly drops with each reaction step: A → B → C → D Suppose the yield is 50% for each reaction; the overall yield of D is only 12.5% from A. In a convergent synthesis A → B (50%) C → D (50%) B + D → E (25%) the overall yield of E (25%) looks much better. Convergent synthesis is applied in the synthesis of complex molecules and involves fragment coupling and independent synthesis. This technique is more useful if the compound is large and symmetric, where at least two aspects of the molecule can be formed separately and still come together.",

The model may represent the population from which observations arise as a mixture of several components, and the problem is that of a mixture model, in which the task is to infer from which of a discrete set of sub-populations each observation originated.

Mixture densities can be used to model a statistical population with subpopulations, where the mixture components are the densities on the subpopulations, and the weights are the proportions of each subpopulation in the overall population.

The converse is often included as part of the theorem. The theorem is often attributed to Giovanni Ceva, who published it in his 1678 work De lineis rectis. But it was proven much earlier by Yusuf Al-Mu'taman ibn Hűd, an eleventh-century king of Zaragoza. Associated with the figures are several terms derived from Ceva's name: cevian (the lines AD, BE, CF are the cevians of O), cevian triangle (the triangle DEF is the cevian triangle of O); cevian nest, anticevian triangle, Ceva conjugate. (Ceva is pronounced Chay'va; cevian is pronounced chev'ian.) The theorem is very similar to Menelaus' theorem in that their equations differ only in sign. Proofs Several proofs of the theorem have been given. Two proofs are given in the following.",

The exclusive-or relation, in which only one of the alternatives is true, but not both, is expressed by a different word, \"onoi\". Again, the word is chosen to make clear the logical equivalence of \"A o no B\" and \"A onoi B\": \"Tu fa titci o no tu fa morce.\" = You will eat if and only if you do not die. \"Tu fa titci onoi tu fa morce.\" = You will eat, or you will die. A special conjunction \"ze\" is used to create a \"mixed\" predicate which may be true even if it is not necessarily true for either of the component predicates. For example, \"Le negda ga nigro ze blabi\" means \"The egg is black-and-white\". This would be true if the egg were striped or speckled; in that case it would not be true that the egg is black nor that it is white. On the other hand, \"Le negda ga nigro e blabi\" would make the claim that \"The egg is black and (it is also) white\".",

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

The deficiencies in Hofmann's model were essentially geometric: carbon bonding was shown as planar, rather than tetrahedral, and the atoms were out of proportion, e.g. carbon was smaller in size than the hydrogen. In 1864, Scottish organic chemist Alexander Crum Brown began to draw pictures of molecules, in which he enclosed the symbols for atoms in circles, and used broken lines to connect the atoms together in a way that satisfied each atom's valence.",

The stabilizing interaction of donating electron density into the transition state σ* orbital of a forming bond was immediately questioned, as this interaction has been widely invoked to explain exactly the opposite—the destabilization of bonds. Traditionally, forming bonds are stabilized when they donate electron density from their bonding HOMO into a neighboring antibonding LUMO, not by accepting electron density into their LUMO. To this end, David A. Evans said of Cieplak's proposal: \"Structures are stabilized by stabilizing their highest energy filled states. This is one of the fundamental assumptions in frontier molecular orbital theory. The Cieplak hypothesis is nonsense.\" However, Hahn and le Noble refute this point by invoking the principle of microscopic reversibility, where the process of bond formation and cleavage are fundamentally equivalent in an",

Epicureanism According to Lucretius, the unpredictable swerve occurs \"at no fixed place or time\": When atoms move straight down through the void by their own weight, they deflect a bit in space at a quite uncertain time and in uncertain places, just enough that you could say that their motion has changed. But if they were not in the habit of swerving, they would all fall straight down through the depths of the void, like drops of rain, and no collision would occur, nor would any blow be produced among the atoms. In that case, nature would never have produced anything.",

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system. A truly irreversible chemical reaction is usually achieved when one of the products exits the reacting system, for example, as does carbon dioxide (volatile) in the reaction CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2↑ History",

In the Cieplak model, electrons from a neighboring bond delocalize into the forming carbon–nucleophile (C–Nuc) bond, lowering the energy of the transition state and accelerating the rate of reaction. Whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the C–Nuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to.

However, one must be cautious when examining a multistep reaction or one with the possibility of rearrangements during an intermediate stage. In some cases, the final products appear in skewed ratios in favor of a more unstable product (called the kinetic product) rather than the more stable product (the thermodynamic product). In this case one must examine the rate-limiting step and the intermediates. Often, the rate-limiting step is the initial formation of an unstable species such as a carbocation. Then, once the carbocation is formed, subsequent rearrangements can occur. In these kinds of reactions, especially when run at lower temperatures, the reactants simply react before the rearrangements necessary to form a more stable intermediate have time to occur.

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

The chemical substance index published by CAS also includes several alloys of uncertain composition. Non-stoichiometric compounds are a special case (in inorganic chemistry) that violates the law of constant composition, and for them, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound, as in the case of palladium hydride.

For example, the reaction corresponding to the standard enthalpy of formation must be written such that one mole of a single product is formed. This will often require that some reactant coefficients be fractional, as is the case with the formation of lithium fluoride: Li(s) + F2(g) → LiF(s) Matrix method Generally, any chemical equation involving J different molecules can be written as: where Rj is the symbol for the j-th molecule, and νj is the stoichiometric coefficient for the j-th molecule, positive for products, negative for reactants (or vice versa).

When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

Mechanism and applications The reaction mechanism involves an intramolecular 5-membered cyclic transition state, leading to a syn elimination product, an Ei pathway. This organic reaction is closely related to the Hofmann elimination, but the base is a part of the leaving group. The amine oxide is prepared by oxidation of the corresponding amine with an oxidant such as meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). The actual elimination just requires heat. Illustrative of the Cope reaction is a synthesis of methylenecyclohexane: Piperidines are resistant to an intramolecular Cope reaction but with pyrrolidine and with rings of size 7 and larger, the reaction product is an unsaturated hydroxyl amine. This result is consistent with the 5-membered cyclic transition state.",

They also sought to answer a fundamental question, namely: is there a pattern to the elements? John Dalton's atoms Scientists had recently discovered that when elements combine to form compounds, they always do so in the same proportions, by weight. John Dalton thought that for this to happen, each element had to be made of its own unique building blocks, which he called atoms.",

Lewis introduced the \"electron dot diagrams\" in this paper to symbolize the electronic structures of atoms and molecules. Now known as Lewis structures, they are discussed in virtually every introductory chemistry book. Lewis in 1923 developed the electron pair theory of acids and base: Lewis redefined an acid as any atom or molecule with an incomplete octet that was thus capable of accepting electrons from another atom; bases were, of course, electron donors. His theory is known as the concept of Lewis acids and bases. In 1923, G. N.

The elementary steps should add up to the original reaction. (Meaning, if we were to cancel out all the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction, we would be left with the original reaction.) When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on parameters such as temperature, pressure, and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier's principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.",

However for many reactions this agrees poorly with experiment, so the rate constant is written instead as . Here P is an empirical steric factor, often much less than 1.00, which is interpreted as the fraction of sufficiently energetic collisions in which the two molecules have the correct mutual orientation to react. Transition state theory The Eyring equation, another Arrhenius-like expression, appears in the \"transition state theory\" of chemical reactions, formulated by Wigner, Eyring, Polanyi and Evans in the 1930s. The Eyring equation can be written: where is the Gibbs energy of activation, is the entropy of activation, is the enthalpy of activation, is Boltzmann's constant, and is Planck's constant.",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

Over time, however, scientists learned how to synthesize organic compounds in the lab. The number of organic compounds is immense and the known number of defined compounds is close to 10 million. However, an indefinitely large number of such compounds is theoretically possible. By definition, an organic compound must contain at least one atom of carbon, but this criterion is not generally regarded as sufficient. Indeed, the distinction between organic and inorganic compounds is ultimately a matter of convention, and there are several compounds that have been classified either way, such as: COCl2, CSCl2, CS(NH2)2, CO(NH2)2. With carbon bonded to metals the field of organic chemistry crosses over into organometallic chemistry. Inorganic compounds",

A CAAC-copper complex even allows OLEDs to be used with a quantum efficiency close to 100% at high brightness. The discovery of stable carbenes was a breakthrough for fundamental chemistry, a real paradigm shift, but its importance also comes, and perhaps more importantly, from applications.

They are of two types: Formed by replacing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH by some other radical, usually an alkyl or aryl radical forming an ester. For example, methyl benzoate is a molecular compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O–CH3, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5COOCH3.

Scientists had no idea how many more they might find, or indeed if there were an infinite number of elements.

Conversely, if one reactant has a known quantity and the quantity of the products can be empirically determined, then the amount of the other reactants can also be calculated.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

In linear synthesis the overall yield quickly drops with each reaction step: A → B → C → D Suppose the yield is 50% for each reaction; the overall yield of D is only 12.5% from A. In a convergent synthesis A → B (50%) C → D (50%) B + D → E (25%) the overall yield of E (25%) looks much better. Convergent synthesis is applied in the synthesis of complex molecules and involves fragment coupling and independent synthesis.

These complex compounds are desirable for their ranging abilities and properties. In order to produce the complex compounds, the simpler ones must “cooperate” in a specific way. This can be very difficult and requires patience, because of the time required to make the bonds so their uses and properties can be tested. There was a need for optimization of this process in order to speed up the development and testing of new compounds. Catellani and her team in 1997 found such a method to optimize this process. Catellani discovered a chain reaction process that simplified and increased yield for desirable complex compounds. One bond the Catellani Reaction is heavily used to create is Carbon-Carbon bonds. These bonds are desirable for their stability and strength. These qualities make the bonds very useful in the makeup of more complex compounds.",

He is credited with the development of several important chemical reactions which bear his name including the Cope elimination and the Cope rearrangement. Cope was born on June 27, 1909, in Dunreith, Indiana. He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Butler University in Indianapolis in 1929 and a PhD in 1932 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His research continued at Harvard University in 1933 as a National Research Council Fellow. In 1934, he joined the faculty of Bryn Mawr College. There, his research included the first syntheses of a number of barbiturates including delvinyl sodium. At Bryn Mawr, Cope also developed a reaction involving the thermal rearrangement of an allyl group which eventually became known as the Cope rearrangement.",

In 1978, he moved to Oxford to become head of the Dyson Perrins Laboratory, where he upgraded its facilities and revolutionised the type of work done, while building links between Organic Chemistry and basic biological research. The laboratory formally closed in 2003, but his group moved to the new research facility, the Chemistry Research Laboratory on Mansfield Road. One of Baldwin's passions was finding out how nature makes chemicals that researchers cannot.

The rule was formulated by Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov in 1870. Explanation The rule states that with the addition of a protic acid HX or other polar reagent to an asymmetric alkene, the acid hydrogen (H) or electropositive part gets attached to the carbon with more hydrogen substituents, and the halide (X) group or electronegative part gets attached to the carbon with more alkyl substituents. This is in contrast to Markovnikov's original definition, in which the rule is stated that the X component is added to the carbon with the fewest hydrogen atoms while the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms.",

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

In some cases, CuCl2 is supported on silica in presence of KCl, LaCl3, or AlCl3 as cocatalysts. Aside from silica, a variety of supports have also been used including various types of alumina, diatomaceous earth, or pumice.

The current definitions were proposed by the chemist George Andrew Olah in 1972, and are now widely accepted. Carbenium ions are generally highly reactive due to having an incomplete octet of electrons; however, certain carbenium ions, such as the tropylium ion, are relatively stable due to the positive charge being delocalised between the carbon atoms. Nomenclature Carbenium ions are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on whether the number of carbon atoms bonded to the ionized carbon is 1, 2, or 3.

Thus, hydrogen chloride (HCl) adds to propene, CH3-CH=CH2 to produce 2-chloropropane CH3CHClCH3 rather than the isomeric 1-chloropropane CH3CH2CH2Cl. The rule is useful in predicting the molecular structures of products of addition reactions.

This idea, however, was initially met with a high degree of skepticism, and only 20 years later, with the synthesis of acetic acid from carbon by Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe, was the idea accepted. Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis of their physical properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, crystallinity, or color).

Liebig published on a wide variety of topics, personally averaging 30 papers per year between 1830 and 1840. Liebig not only isolated individual substances, but also studied their interrelationships and the ways in which they degraded and metamorphosed into other substances, looking for clues to the understanding of both chemical composition and physiological function. Other significant contributions by Liebig during this time include his examination of the nitrogen content of bases; the study of chlorination and the isolation of chloral (1832); the identification of the ethyl radical (1834); the oxidation of alcohol and formation of aldehyde (1835); the polybasic theory of organic acids (1838); and the degradation of urea (1837).",

Debate It is disputed that Wöhler's synthesis sparked the downfall of the theory of vitalism, which states that organic matter possessed a certain vital force common to all living things. Prior to the Wöhler synthesis, the work of John Dalton and Jöns Jacob Berzelius had already convinced chemists that organic and inorganic matter obey the same chemical laws. It took until 1845 when Kolbe reported another inorganic – organic conversion (of carbon disulfide to acetic acid) before vitalism started to lose support. A 2000 survey found that 90% of chemical textbooks repeat some version of the Wöhler myth. References Name reactions Organic reactions",
