The tripodal ligands contain urea, amido or sulfonamido hydrogen-bond donors, which are aligned to bind to the regions of greatest electron density along the faces and edges of the octahedral anion. The ligand structure incorporates a protonatable bridgehead nitrogen centre that provides a positive charge to ensure the solubility of a neutral 2:1 [LH](+)/[PtCl(6)](2-) complex in water-immiscible solvents. The extraction of [PtCl(6)](2-) from acidic chloride solutions was evaluated by using a pH-swing mechanism to control the loading and stripping of the metallate anion. The ligands L(1)-L(3), L(5)-L(9), L(11)-L(13) and L(15) showed extremely high loading (up to 95% in some cases) and high selectivity for [PtCl(6)](2-) over chloride ions (present in a 60-fold excess) compared with trioctylamine, a model Alamine reagent, which, under identical conditions, only extracted 10% of the Pt(IV) anions. Generally, extraction was observed to be greater for urea-containing ligands than their amido analogues, and a quantitative recovery of platinum from feed solutions was achieved.

Tremorgens have been implicated in a number of neurologic diseases of cattle collectively known as staggers syndromes, and pose significant agricultural and health problems for both cattle and humans. Although the effects of tremorgens are thought to result from transient perturbations of amino acid neurotransmitter release mechanisms, there is reason to believe that acute exposures to toxins with such synaptic effects may result in degeneration of neuronal fiber processes. To test this hypothesis, rats were given a single tremorgenic (3 mg/kg, IP) dose of aflatrem, and kinetics of amino acid neurotransmitter uptake was assessed in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals at 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks after injection. Results indicate a decrease in the capacity of the GABA and glutamate uptake systems, which was interpreted as a loss of nerve terminals. The affinity constants suggest a decrease in release of these transmitters as well. In addition to its transient influence on transmitter release, a single low dose of aflatrem is able to induce degeneration of neuronal processes in hippocampal neurotransmitter systems and therefore represents a long-term health threat.",

This hitherto unidentified disease was characterized by hypersensitivity, incoordination, a peculiar stiff-legged gait of the hind legs, severe generalized tumors of the sketetal muscles, progressive paresis, paralysis and constipation. The most notable gross pathological lesions were degenerative and necrotic changes in certain skeletal muscles, haemorrhages on the serosal surfaces, especially on the dorsal aspect of the rumen, and gastro-intestinal stasis. Microscopical examination of the central nervous system revealed cytopathological changes consisting of degeneration and necrosis of the large motor cells in the ventral horns of the spinal cord and bigger neurones in numerous nuclei of the medulla oblongata, midbrain and thalamus. By feeding the suspect ration and its component parts to cattle and sheep, it was possible to identify mouldy sorghum beer residue as the toxic component in the ration. A. clavatus, the dominant fungus on the toxic residue, was readily isolated in pure culture. The entire syndrome was then reproduced in a yearling Friesland steer dosed with pure cultures of the A. clavatus isolate grown on autoclaved non-toxic sorghum beer residue.

Except for a few toxins that are produced by Claviceps paspali, a plant parasitic fungus, most tremorgenic mycotoxins are synthesized by common saprophytic moulds of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus. Since these compounds produce sustained tremor in the abscence of other neurotoxic effects, several authors have suggested that they are the causative agents of a number of naturally occurring incoordination syndromes in ruminants. The nature of the tremor produced by these compounds in laboratory animals is clinically indistinguishable from that occurring naturally. In particular, the most implicated tremorgenic mycotoxins are those that contain a single nitrogen atom in their molecules. Although individual compounds within this group are produced by unrelated fungal species, they all contain a similar biologically active chemical moiety. To date, their mechanism of action is unknown, and their role in neuropharmacology has not yet been defined. However, the presence of a GABA-like conformation within their active nucleus and the limited torsional flexibility of this moiety suggest that they are partial agonists of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). A hypothetical mode of action of these toxins at the GABA receptor sites is presented and discussed.",

Their biosynthetic gene (ftm) cluster was identified on the basis of the genome sequence of A. fumigatus. However, it has been reported that the ftm cluster in genome reference strain Af293 is inactive, which makes complete understanding of the FTM pathway difficult. Hence, we used an FTM-producing strain of A. fumigatus, BM939, to dissect the FTM pathway. Here, we delineate the genetic determinant for the observed defect in the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293. Metabolite profiling and sequence comparison of the two strains revealed a point mutation in ftmD as a possible cause of altered metabolite production in strain Af293. FTM production in Af293 was restored when a DNA fragment containing ftmD from BM939 was introduced. Biochemical analysis indicated that FtmD is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of 6-hydroxytryprostatin B into tryprostatin A. The mutated FtmD retained enzymatic activity but did not function under physiological conditions, resulting in blockage of the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293.",

A few animals variously had reduced milk production, hyperaesthesia, drooling of saliva, hypermetria of hind limbs or muscle spasms. Degeneration of large neurones was seen in the brain stem and spinal cord grey matter. The syndrome was consistent with A clavatus tremorgenic mycotoxicosis of ruminants. The cases are the earliest known to be associated with this fungus in Australia. They highlight a potential hazard of hydroponic fodder production systems, which appear to favour A clavatus growth on sprouted grain, exacerbated in some cases by equipment malfunctions that increase operating temperatures.",

Aspergillus nidulans, a model filamentous fungus studied for more than fifty years, produces the mycotoxin sterigmatocystin (ST). This mycotoxin, ST, and the well-known carcinogenic compounds called aflatoxins (AF), produced by related species such as A. flavus, A. parasiticus, and A. nomius [6], are both synthesized through a conserved metabolic pathway [7,8,9] where ST is the penultimate precursor. The genes responsible for ST/AF production are clustered. Within these clusters, the regulatory gene aflR encodes a transcription factor that acts as a specific cluster activator [10,11,12].\n\nThe range of secondary metabolites produced by A. nidulans also includes bioactive compounds with demonstrated beneficial effects and applications for medical treatments, including antibiotics, such as the beta-lactam penicillin (PN) [13,14], or anti-tumoral metabolites such as terrequinone [15,16], with potential direct application in the medical field. In both cases the genes involved in the synthesis of these compounds are also found clustered [16,17].",

The tremor produced by these CNS routes was compared with that produced by i.p. administration of the toxin or the dried mycelium of the fungus that synthesizes the verruculogen. The nature and degree of tremor produced by the central vs peripheral routes suggest that the site of action of verruculogen is not immediately adjacent to the cannula sites in the brain. Measures of the amino acids in the superfusates collected during the verruculogen-induced tremor showed an increase in the excitatory neurotransmitters, glutamate and aspartate in superfusates from the lateral ventricle but not in superfusates from the cortical surface. The differential effect on transmitter release suggests that a subcortical action of verruculogen is responsible for its tremorgenic activity.",

It was the first example of a group of polyether toxins produced by marine microalgae, which is responsible for the natural phenomena known as Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, DSP red tides. These toxins are accumulated in the digestive glands of the shellfish with a disastrous effect upon the shellfish industry in many parts of the world. Thus, it has been demonstrated that OA is a highly selective inhibitor of protein phosphatases type 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), subsequently that it causes dramatic increases in phosphorylation of numerous proteins as well as being a potent tumour promoter.

The most prominent feature of okadaic acid is its potent and specific action to inhibit protein phosphatases type 2A, I, and 2B [12]. Because many biological events, including tumor promotion, are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signal proteins, the acid is extensively used in biochemical studies. Okadaic acid and its analogs produced by planktonic dinoflagellates Dinophysis spp. are accumulated by bivalve shellfish and cause worldwide human intoxication named diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. Dinophysisfortii produces another polyether macrolide, pectenotoxin-2, in addition to okadaic acid. Though pectenotoxin-2 shows potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells of human origin, its hepatotoxicity prohibits its potential use for therapeutic purpose.\n\nThe three toxins shown in Fig. 5 are examples which show the extraordinarily complex structures of marine toxins.

Okadaic acid exhibits a cyclic structure, which is maintained via an intramolecular hydrogen bond. This is reminiscent of other macrocyclic protein phosphatase inhibitors.

Molecular models for bound motuporin, microcystins, okadaic acid, and calyculin A.\nThe hepatotoxic cyclic heptapeptide microcystins and cyclic pentapeptide nodularins are powerful liver tumor promoters and potent inhibitors of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase-1 and -2A (PP-1c and PP-2Ac). In marked contrast to microcystins, which interact covalently with PP-1 and PP-2A, the nodularins do not bind covalently to PP-1 and PP-2A and may additionally possess unique carcinogenic properties. The conformation of microcystin-LR has been determined in solution and bound to PP-1c. We show here that the free NMR solution structures of two distinct microcystin structural congeners (microcystin-LR and -LL) are remarkably similar to the bound crystal structure of microcystin-LR. We have exploited this finding by using Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling to dock the solution structures of microcystin-LL and the marine toxin motuporin (nodularin-V) onto the crystal structure of PP-1c. Both of these toxins occupy a position similar to that of microcystin-LR when bound to PP-1c. However, although there are relatively minor differences in the structural orientation of microcystin-LL compared with microcystin-LR, there is a striking difference in the position of the N-methyldehydrobutyrine residue in motuporin relative to the comparable N-methyldehydroalanine residue in microcystin-LR. We propose that this difference in orientation provides a molecular explanation for why nodularins are incapable of forming a covalent linkage with PP-1c. Furthermore, the predicted position of N-methyldehydrobutyrine in motuporin is at the surface of the PP-1c-toxin complex, which may thus facilitate chemical interaction with a further macromolecule(s) possibly relating to its carcinogenic properties. PP-1c and PP-2Ac are also targets for other marine toxins such as okadaic acid and calyculin A. It was therefore of interest to use Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling to dock the known free crystal structures of okadaic acid and calyculin A to the crystal structure of PP-1c. These experiments predict that both okadaic acid and calyculin A are strikingly similar to microcystins and motuporin in their tertiary structure and relative PP-1c binding position.",

At 5 DIC or 19 DIC (EC50 approximately 2.5 nM and approximately 4.5 nM respectively), neurons appeared to be less sensitive to OKA. Neurotoxicity by OKA was not reduced by VSCC antagonists such as nifedipine and verapamil, nor by antagonists of excitatory aminoacid (EAA) receptors including APV, MK801 or CNQX. VSCC antagonists and EAA receptors antagonists fully protected from neurotoxicity induced by depolarization with KCl. These results suggest that OKA mechanism of neurotoxicity may not directly involve VSCC, endogenous EAA release and EAA receptors, but may depend upon other neurochemical events.",

Okadaic acid is found in the marine sponges Halichondria okadai and Halichondria melanodocia and shellfish. It is a metabolite of Prorocentrum lima. It is a diarrhetic shellfish toxin. Okadaic acid is a toxin that accumulates in bivalves and causes diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. The molecular formula of okadaic acid, which is a derivative of a C38 fatty acid, is C44H68O13. The IUPAC name of okadaic acid is (2R)-2-hydroxy-3-{(2S,5R,6R,8S)-5-hydroxy-[(1R,2E)-3-((2R,5R,6'S,8'R,8a'S)-8'-hydroxy-6'-{(1S,3S)-1-hydroxy-3-[(3R,6S)-3-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undec-2-yl]butyl}-7'-methyleneoctahydro-3H,3'H-spiro[furan-2,2'-pyrano[3,2-b]pyran]-5-yl)-1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl]-10-methyl-1,7-dioxaspiro[5.5]undec-10-en-2-yl}-2-methylpropanoic acid. Okadaic acid was named from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai, from which okadaic acid was isolated for the first time. It has also been isolated from another marine sponge, H. malanodocia, as a cytotoxin. The real producer of okadaic acid is a marine dinoflagellate. Okadaic acid has been shown to exhibit anti-tumor, signalling, apoptotic and lipolytic functions  Okadaic acid belongs to the family of Okadaic Acids and Derivatives. These are heat-stable polyether and lipophilic compounds that accumulate in the fatty tissue of shellfish. (A3211, A3212, A3213, A3214).\"]",

Phosphatases are important modulators of enzyme activity and cell signaling pathways. However, the interactions between the OA/DTX toxins and phosphatases are not fully understood. This study sought to identify phosphatase targets and characterize their structure-activity relationships (SAR) with these algal toxins using a combination of phosphatase activity and cytotoxicity assays. Preliminary screening of 21 human and yeast phosphatases indicated that only three ser/thr PPs (PP2a, PP1, PP5) were inhibited by physiologically saturating concentrations of DTX2 (200 nM). SAR studies employed naturally-isolated OA, DTX1, and DTX2, which vary in degree and/or position of methylation, in addition to synthetic 2-<iepi</i-DTX2. OA/DTX analogs induced cytotoxicity and inhibited PP activity with a relatively conserved order of potency: OA = DTX1 \u2265 DTX2 &gt;&gt; 2-<iepi</i-DTX. The PPs were also differentially inhibited with sensitivities of PP2a &gt; PP5 &gt; PP1. These findings demonstrate that small variations in OA/DTX toxin structures, particularly at the head region (i.e., C1/C2), result in significant changes in toxicological potency, whereas changes in methylation at C31 and C35 (tail region) only mildly affect potency. In addition to this being the first study to extensively test OA/DTX analogs' activities towards PP5, these data will be helpful for accurately determining toxic equivalence factors (TEFs), facilitating molecular modeling efforts, and developing highly selective phosphatase inhibitors.",

In addition, a protein phosphatase inhibitor distinct from okadaic acid/dinophysistoxin-1 was identified in diarrhetic mussels with a potency equivalent to 900 ng okadaic acid/g digestive tract.

Outbreaks of DSP have been increasing and are of worldwide public health concern; therefore, there is a growing demand for more rapid, reliable, and economical analytical methods for the detection of this toxin. In this study, anti-okadaic acid single-chain variable fragment (scFv) genes were prepared by cloning heavy and light chain genes from hybridoma cells, followed by fusion of the chains via a linker peptide. An scFv-pLIP6/GN recombinant plasmid was constructed and transformed into Escherichia coli for expression, and the target scFv was identified with IC-CLEIA (chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay). The IC15 was 0.012\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0\u03bcg/L, and the IC50 was 0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0\u03bcg/L. The three-dimensional structure of the scFv was simulated with computer modeling, and okadaic acid was docked to the scFv model to obtain a putative structure of the binding complex. Two predicted critical amino acids, Ser32 and Thr187, were then mutated to verify this theoretical model. Both mutants exhibited significant loss of binding activity. These results help us to understand this specific scFv-antigen binding mechanism and provide guidance for affinity maturation of the antibody in\u00a0vitro. The high-affinity scFv developed here also has potential for okadaic acid toxin detection.",

Neither methyl okadaate (a weak phosphatase inhibitor) nor OA modify the total amount of F-actin, but both toxins cause similar changes in the F-actin cytoskeleton, with strong retraction and rounding, and in many cases cell detachment. OA and dinophysistoxin-1 (35S-methylokadaic acid) cause rapid changes in the structural organization of intermediate filaments, followed by a loss of microtubules, solubilization of intermediate filament proteins, and disruption of desmosomes.

These DSP toxins include the polyketide inhibitors okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-4 which are produced by dinoflagellates. Other natural protein phosphatase inhibitors include cyclic peptide inhibitors such as microcystins and nodularins, as well as calyculin and tautomycin (Gupta et al., 1997). The toxins, though structurally dissimilar from one another, all seem to bind at the active site of each phosphatase, where they contact multiple residues near the active site (Suganuma et al., 1989). A free carboxyl and hydroxyl group in the molecule is essential for receptor binding in the case of okadaic acid (see Figure 3). These moieties are important for such compounds to bind to a receptorial site on PP 1 and PP2A, thus inhibiting their activity and interfering with signal transduction processes, including ion channel regulation (Sasaki, K. et al., 1994).  (Catterall, W. A. , 1997).\n\nAs the diarrheic effect of okadaic acid and related toxins has been attributed to the accumulation of phosphorylated proteins that control sodium secretion in intestinal cells, a detection method for such cathartic compounds based on the inhibition of protein phosphatases is of particular interest. Using the specific inhibition of both PPl and PP2A catalytic subunits provides a sensitive method to detect diarrhetic shellfish poisoning.

Regarding its structure (see Figure 1), OA is a cyclic polyether C38 fatty acid with a remarkable variety of functionalities and structural features. OA contains 17 stereogenic centers, 3 spiroketal moieties, a trans alkene, a 1-disubstituted exocyclic alkene, an \u03b1methyl, \u03b1-hydroxy carboxylic acid, and 3 secondary alcohols [9].

It is a traditional medicine, having some active ingredients used for the treatment of numerous diseases. During recent research on ginger, various ingredients like zingerone, shogaol, and paradol have been obtained from it. Zingerone (4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is a nontoxic and inexpensive compound with varied pharmacological activities. It is the least pungent component of Zingiber officinale. Zingerone is absent in fresh ginger but cooking or heating transforms gingerol to zingerone. Zingerone closely related to vanillin from vanilla and eugenol from clove. Zingerone has potent anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antilipolytic, antidiarrhoeic, antispasmodic, and so forth properties. Besides, it displays the property of enhancing growth and immune stimulation. It behaves as appetite stimulant, anxiolytic, antithrombotic, radiation protective, and antimicrobial. Also, it inhibits the reactive nitrogen species which are important in causing Alzheimer's disease and many other disorders. This review is written to shed light on the various pharmacological properties of zingerone and its role in alleviating numerous human and animal diseases. ",

In order to reach the multiple specification targets, various structures have been synthesized and evaluated to select the one demonstrating broad antimicrobial spectrum with favorable environmental profile and application potential to a wide variety of formulas. In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized structures, the method of the challenge test consisting in an artificial contamination of the sample with collection microbial strains and evaluation of the number of revivable microorganisms was used to select the most promising candidate. Validation of its antimicrobial potential was later confirmed on Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, yeast and mold with measurement of its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in comparison with known preservatives. Environmental impact assessment of the selected candidate was achieved with the help of ready biodegradability and aquatic ecotoxicity tests performed according to appropriate Organization tes a strfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) guidelinesy. Bio-inspired from turmeric and ginger extracts, an ethylated analog of Zingerone (EZ) with the chemical name 4-(3-ethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one demonstrates the strongest activity on Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Moreover, EZ shows a solubility in water 2 times higher than that of Zingerone thus increasing its interest as a potential preservative. Finally, its assessment of ready biodegradability and aquatic ecotoxicity in OECD-EU tests with a favorable environmental profile confirms its unique interest and fully justifies its use in cosmetic formulas as an eco-respectful preservative. Bio-inspiration based on technologies without noteworthy side effects but also on eco-design, particularly through the use of measures of potential environmental impact very upstream of a development, are two fundamental elements for the launching of new eco-friendly cosmetic ingredients. This approach has thus validated the strong potential of EZ as a preservative of eco-respectful formulas. The selection of EZ is also a very good example of the achievement of two key objectives targeted by cosmetic companies for the development of a novel active ingredient: environmental performance and technical performance.",

Zingerone is a crystalline solid that is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ether. Zingerone is similar in chemical structure to other flavor chemicals such as vanillin and eugenol. It is used as a flavor additive in spice oils and in perfumery to introduce spicy aromas. Fresh ginger does not contain zingerone, but it is produced by cooking or drying of the ginger root, which causes a reverse aldol reaction on gingerol. Production History Zingerone was first isolated from the ginger root in 1917 by Hiroshi Nomura, a chemistry professor at Tokyo Imperial University. Nomura named the compound and identified the empirical formula of zingerone in his studies at the laboratory of the Agricultural College. He initially identified it as the chemical component contributing pungency to ginger, something further work has disproven.",

Moreover, immunoblotting techniques showed that ZO treatment effectively enhances Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3 expressions and decreases the expression of Bcl-2 in colon cancer cells. Together, our results evidenced that the antitumor effects of ZO reduce cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis through modulating pro- and antiapoptotic molecular events in HCT116 colon cancer cells.

However there is an increasing preference of the consumer for \"natural\" food additives all over the world, mainly due to increasing health and nutrition conscious lifestyles [2]. This trend is reflected in European and US legislations [3] that clearly discriminate between natural or synthetic (natural-identical) flavors, turning the interest of industries to the production of natural flavors. In addition, these legislations consider that the strategy of production of flavors by microbial processes (namely white biotechnology or green chemistry) can be labeled as \"natural\" [4].\n\nZingerone [4-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one] CAS#122-  (1) is the least pungent component of Zingiber officinale Rosc.

Simultaneously it also minimizes the lipid oxidation of food, which strongly suggests that 1 can be used as an antioxidant and food preservative [8]. This phenolic alkanone is also present in wines at very low concentrations (0.74-8.94 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u00b5g/mL) [9]. In addition to the applications as a food additive, 1 possesses several pharmacological effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiemetic, anxiolytic, antithrombotic, radiation protective, antimicrobial, immunostimulant enhancer and appetite stimulant [7,10,11], also inhibiting the formation of reactive nitrogen species which are important factors for Alzheimer's disease [12].

In the current study, we aimed at demonstrating the protective effect of zingerone against experimental colon carcinogenesis and elucidating its possible mechanism by studying inflammatory and Nrf-2 signaling cascade. Four groups of animals (I-IV) were made with six animals each. Group I (control) was given normal saline orally. Group II was given 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) at the dose rate of 20\u2009mg/kg body weight. Group III and IV were treated with DMH at the dose rate of 20\u2009mg/kg body weight and also received oral treatment of zingerone at a dose rate of 50 and 100\u2009mg/kg body weight, respectively, for first 5 weeks and animals were euthanized after 16\u2009weeks. Our results reveal that DMH treated rats exhibited elevated ROS and MDA levels, increased activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 and serum marker enzyme carcinoembreyonic antigen (CEA), increased no of aberrant crypts of foci (ACF), and elevated expression of inflammatory and proliferative proteins. Nrf-2 was downregulated by DMH treatment. Treatment with zingerone to DMH treated rats, resulted in alterations in the activity of the cytochrome P450 2E1 and CEA. In addition, immunostaining of NF-kB-p65, COX-2, iNOS, and PCNA, Ki-67 was suppressed by zingerone. Furthermore, zingerone administration also attenuated the level of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and it also helps in preserving mucous layer. Thus, zingerone could be considered as a good chemopreventive agent in experimental model of colon carcinogenesis. Further studies are required to study other pathways involved in colon carcinogenesis and their modulation buy zingerone.",

Gingerol oil (ginger extract) is transferred by heating into zingerone. Recent studies reported the effect of zingerone on prostate cancer cells. The aim of the present research is to investigate the protective effect of zingerone against BPH. Sixty male Albino Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control group, prostatic hyperplasia group treated with saline, and prostatic hyperplasia group treated with zingerone (PH-Z-G). At day 28, all rats were sacrificed, epididymis and prostate samples were collected for histopathological examination and Western blotting for androgen receptors (ARs) proteins and steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 (SRD5A1). Human RWPE-1 prostatic cell line was assessed for viability and cycle after treated with zingerone 500 \u03bcg/day for 10 days. PH-S group showed significant (<iP</i &lt; 0.05) thickening of connective tissue septa associated with narrowing of acinar lumen. PH-Z group showed regain of the normal histological feature. SRD5A1 and AR expression was significantly (<iP</i &lt; 0.05) reduced in PH-Z group in comparison with PH-S group. Cell line proliferation was significantly reduced after application of zingerone with G2/M cell cycle arrest. Our results showed that natural herbal zingerone decreased the prostatic tissue levels of (5\u03b1 reductase and AR) in rat BPH model, which could be a promising herbal medicine for BPH treatment. Further human clinical trials are required.",

In this context, inflammatory and oxidative markers have gained much attention as targets for therapeutic intervention. We studied the effect of zingerone in a streptozotocin/high fat diet (STZ/HFD)-induced type 2 diabetic Wistar rat model. Zingerone also known as vanillyl acetone is a pharmacologically active compound present usually in dry ginger. STZ/HFD caused excessive increase in ROS and inflammation in experimental animals. The treatment with zingerone markedly abrogated ROS levels, inhibited the NF-\u043aB activation and considerably reduced level of other downstream inflammatory molecules (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2), furthermore, zingerone treatment improved renal functioning by significantly decreasing the levels of kidney toxicity markers KIM-1, BUN, creatinine, and LDH and suppressed TGF-\u03b2. Collectively, these findings indicate that zingerone treatment improved renal function by anti-hyperglycaemic, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, suggesting the efficacy of zingerone in the treatment of DN.",

The presence of wide assortment of phytochemicals is identified to be able to meddle with various types of sicknesses. Consequently, chemoprevention of illnesses by phytochemicals has become a prospering field of exploration over the previous decade [2]. The rhizome of ginger (Zingiber officinale), family Zingiberaceae is used worldwide as a spice and natural medication and is grown in most tropical areas of the world [3]. Camphene, \u03b2-phellandrene, curcumene, cineole, geranyl acetic acid derivation, terpineol, borneol, geraniol, limonene, \u03b2-elemene, zingiberol, linalool, \u03b1-zingiberene, \u03b2sesquiphellandrene, \u03b2-bisabolene, zingiberenol and \u03b1-Farnesene are volatile chemical constituents incorporated in ginger rhizomes. The non-volatile and impactful phytochemicals comprising in ginger are gingerols, shogaols, paradols and zingerone [4,5]. Many investigations recommended that individuals in South East Asian nations have a much lower incidence of colon, gastrointestinal, prostate, breast and other cancers than their western partners. Thus, it is accepted that the phenolic substances from restorative plants, natural products and vegetables in their eating regimen may assume a significant function in the protection [6]. Ginger contains sharp phenolic substances known as gingerols. One of these, 6gingerol (1-[4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl]-5hydroxy-3-decanone), is the major pharmacologically-dynamic segment of ginger [7,8] and the dynamic aspect of the molecule is the aliphatic chain moiety containing a hydroxyl group (Fig. 1) [9]. 6-gingerol is the significant phenolic bioactive part separated from rhizome of ginger (Zingiber officinale) which is answerable for spicy taste of ginger. It has been revealed to show antiproliferative effects against a wide scope of cells by repressing different endurance pathways including NF-\u041aB and \u03b2-catenine [10]. Like",

Bae et al. [109], investigated zingerone using a mouse skin tumor model and found that it suppressed tumor progression and tumor angiogenesis. Zingerone also inhibited the angiogenic activities of endothelial cells. The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were decreased in the tumor cells. Investigators [110] also showed that it has anti-mitotic effects against human neuroblastoma cells and inhibits cellular viability of those cells in prometaphase. Zingerone-treated neuroblastoma cells also showed decreased cyclin D1 expression and induced cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. Furthermore, zingerone inhibited the growth of neuroblastoma tumors in BALB/c mice.\n\nGanaie et al. [111] demonstrated the protective effect of zingerone against experimental colon carcinogenesis. Their results reveal that DMH-treated rats that received zingerone exhibited elevated ROS, increased activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 and the serum marker CEA, with a lowered number of ACF. There was also decreased expression of inflammatory proteins. Nrf-2 was downregulated in the tumors of the zingerone-treated animals with an accompanying reduction of the activities of cytochrome P450 2E1 and CEA. In addition, NFkB, COX-2, iNOS, PCNA, and Ki-67 were suppressed, as were the levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1.\n\n\nCellular and Molecular Activities of \u03b1-Zingiberene\n\n\u03b1-Zingiberene is primarily found in the peel of the rhizome [112]. It has strong anti-proliferative activity for human colon carcinoma cells in vitro. \u03b1-Zingiberene treatment produced nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in uterine carcinoma cells and the percentage of sub-diploid cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, the cells exhibited hallmark features of apoptosis as mitochondrial cytochrome c was released and CAS-3 was activated [113].\n\n\nBitter/Shampoo Ginger",

Pyochelin (Pch) is a catecholate type of phenolate siderophore produced and utilized by the pathogen P. aeruginosa to assimilate iron when colonizing the vertebrate host. Zingerone, is active component present in ginger, a dietary herb known for its anti-virulent approach against P. aeruginosa. In the present study, zingerone was exploited to act as a good substitute for existing antibiotics, known to have developed resistance by most pathogens. Encouraging results were obtained by docking analysis of pyochelin-zingerone conjugate with FptA, the outer membrane receptor of pyochelin. Conjugate also showed anti-quorum sensing activity and also inhibited swimming, swarming, and twitching motilities as well as biofilm formation in vitro.",

Patients with hormone-dependent PCa are initially sensitive to androgen-deprivation therapy, later the cancer progress to a hormone-independent state and fails to respond and progress to the metastatic stage, where the cells gain the ability to escape cell death and develop resistance to current therapies, thereby leading\u00a0to migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer. Many clinical trials\u00a0using nutraceuticals on cancer using human subjects have also been extensively studied, these studies confirm the efficacy of drugs tested in in vitro and in vivo preclinical models. Among various dietary phytochemicals, ginger is commonly used in the diet and possesses many\u00a0active principles that act against cancer. Among various active principles, zingerone is\u00a0a key active phenolic compound present in Zingiber officinale (Ginger), it has potent antioxidant property and it acts against carcinogens. The present study evaluated the efficacy of zingerone at different doses on the PCa cell line regarding apoptosis, upstream signing molecules such as Akt/mTOR, and migration metastasis. A cell viability assay using MTT was\u00a0performed to estimate the percentage of viability of zingerone-treated PC-3 cells. The mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular reactive oxygen species, and apoptosis induction in the zingerone-treated PC-3 cells were studied by using different fluorescence\u00a0staining techniques. The expression patterns of PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, and p-mTOR were investigated through the Western blot analysis assay. Zingerone induces apoptosis and alters Akt/mTOR molecules; it also inhibits cell adhesion and\u00a0migration of PCa cells. From the present study, it is concluded that\u00a0zingerone effectively induces apoptosis and inhibits cancer signaling, thereby acting as a potent drug against PCa.",

The present study was designed to explicate the protective role of zingerone; an active ingredient of ginger in complete Freund's adjuvant (FCA)-immunized arthritic rats. 24 Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups with 6 rats each. Group I as control followed by group II, III and IV were treated with single intradermal injection of FCA (0.1\u2005ml\u2009=\u2009100\u2005\u00b5g) to induce rheumatoid arthritis. Group III and IV were also administered with zingerone orally at 25\u2005mg/kg b.w for 3 weeks at two different time points. Adjuvant-treated rats exhibited a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and a reduction in the enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD, catalase and GPx, in the liver and joint tissues. Moreover, FCA inoculation resulted in the increase in levels of NF-\u03baB, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and Hs-CRP and a decrease in IL-10 levels. Zingerone significantly reduced the levels of NF-\u03baB, TGF-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and Hs-CRP and markedly increased IL-10 levels. Levels of antioxidant enzymes were also restored by zingerone treatment. Oral administration of zingerone ameliorated inflammatory outburst and decreased oxidative stress, suggesting its role in the prevention of rheumatoid arthritis.

[38] reported a negative effect of prenatal testosterone administration on scrotal size and semen concentration. The increase in sperm number after zingerone treatment which was revealed in our study comes in consistence with Khaki et al. [39] as they reported a positive effect of ginger and cinnamon on sperm vitality, number, and motility, which was also reported by Bordbar et al. [40] We noticed that testosterone administration caused hyperplasia of the glandular lining epithelium, thickening of connective tissue septa in addition to narrowing of acinar lumen in PH-S group as mentioned by others [41][42][43] who examined the effect of testosterone on the histopathological changes in prostate tissue related to exogenous testosterone administration. PH-Z group showed regain of the normal histological feature, which indicates the protective effects of zingerone on prostatic tissue histological feature. [30,36,44] Eight days after application of 500 \u00b5g/day zingerone to non-neoplastic prostatic cell line, we noticed reduction in cellular proliferation and viability. On the other hand, Akimoto et al. [45] stated that ginger extract has negative impact on cancerous cells [46,47] via inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin. Chen et al. [48] reported the anti-cancerous activity of ginger extract, which comes in the same context with Vijaya et al. [49] In our research, we noticed that zingerone caused human prostatic cell cycle arrest as confirmed by Choi et al. [50] who reported inhibition of neuroblastoma cells after application of zingerone. Previously, the same effect was reported on pancreatic cancer cells. [51] We noticed that SRD5A1 and AR expression was reduced in PH-Z group, which comes in consistence with Li et al. [52] who mentioned that Paraquat reduced SRD5A1 expression in testicular tissue. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to link between exogenous zingerone administration and the lowering of 5\u03b1-R activity, which may explain the positive beneficial effect of zingerone on prostatic tissue.\n\n\nconclusIon",

(a) Exploration of bacteria from understudied environments and taxa follows the hypothesis that different selective pressures may lead to the evolution of distinct chemistry. Genomes are sequenced and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) are identified using bioinformatic tools. (b) BGCs of interest are selected. Heterologous expression in suitable hosts can be used to streamline natural product discovery. Genome editing of native producers offers an alternative approach to aid discovery and to study gene and BGC function.

Derivatives of ethanolamine are widespread in nature; e.g., lipids, as precursor of a variety of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), that modulate several animal and plant physiological processes such as seed germination, plant\u2013pathogen interactions, chloroplast development and flowering, as well as precursor, combined with arachidonic acid 20:4, \u03c9-6), to form the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA: ; 20:4, \u03c9-6).",

NAEs include palmitoylethanolamide (anti-inflammatory and analgesic substance), oleoylethanolamide (anorexic substance), and anandamide (endocannabinoid). The endogenous levels of NAEs are mainly regulated by enzymes responsible for their biosynthesis and degradation. In mammalian tissues, the major biosynthetic pathway starts from glycerophospholipids and is composed of two enzyme reactions. The first step is N-acylation of ethanolamine phospholipids catalyzed by Ca(2+)-dependent N-acyltransferase and the second step is the release of NAEs from N-acylated ethanolamine phospholipids by N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE)-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). As for the degradation of NAEs, fatty acid amide hydrolase plays the central role. However, recent studies strongly suggest the involvement of other enzymes in the NAE metabolism. These enzymes include members of the HRAS-like suppressor family (also called phospholipase A/acyltransferase family), which were originally discovered as tumor suppressors but can function as Ca(2+)-independent NAPE-forming N-acyltransferases; multiple enzymes involved in the NAPE-PLD-independent multi-step pathways to generate NAE from NAPE, which came to light by the analysis of NAPE-PLD-deficient mice; and a lysosomal NAE-hydrolyzing acid amidase as a second NAE hydrolase. These newly recognized enzymes may become the targets for the development of new therapeutic drugs. Here, we focus on recent enzymological findings in this area. ",

Some ethanolamides are naturally occurring, such as anandamide, palmitoylethanolamide and prostamides, which play physiological roles as lipid neurotransmitters and autacoids. The crystal structure of the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD has revealed how these endogenous ethanolamides are generated from cell membranes, and that bile acids play a role in their production. Ethanolamides can be prepared synthetically by heating esters with ethanolamine. See also Diethanolamide Docosatetraenoylethanolamide Oleoylethanolamide References External links Fatty acid amides",

To date, no libraries of HS oligosaccharides bearing systematically varied sulfation structures are available owing to the challenges in synthesizing a large number of HS oligosaccharides. To overcome the obstacles and expedite the synthesis, a divergent approach was designed, where 64 HS tetrasaccharides covering all possible structures of 2-O-, 6-O- and N-sulfation with the glucosamine-glucuronic acid-glucosamine-iduronic acid backbone were successfully produced from a single strategically protected tetrasaccharide intermediate. This extensive library helped identify the structural requirements for HS sequences to have strong fibroblast growth factor-2 binding but a weak affinity for platelet factor-4. Such a strategy to separate out these two interactions could lead to new HS-based potential therapeutics without the dangerous adverse effect of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.",

This is instead not possible by using allergens produced by extraction from natural sources or by recombinant DNA techniques. In this work, we aimed to test for the first time the feasibility of the total chemical synthesis of an allergenic protein. Pru p 3, the most studied member of the family of lipid transfer proteins, relevant plant food pan-allergens, was used as model target. Strategies for the convergent assembly of the target protein, starting from five peptide fragments to be bound by means of either native chemical ligation or peptide hydrazide ligation, followed by desulfurization, to achieve ligations at alanine, were developed and tested. All the reaction conditions were set up and optimized. Two large peptides covering the two halves of the protein sequence were synthesized and structurally characterized by means of circular dichroism, and their immunogenicity was proved by means of immunoblot, using antibodies against Pru p 3, and immunoCAP inhibition tests. Finally, the five peptides were bound together to produce the whole protein stretch. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of total chemical synthesis as a new way to obtain pure allergens. Copyright \u00a9 2017 European Peptide Society and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

A great advantage of recombinant allergens is that they can be used for component-resolved diagnostics, which makes it possible to establish the patient's individual IgE reactivity profile before therapy is selected. However, before recombinant allergens can be applied in clinical practice their biological activity has to be carefully investigated in vivo. We here describe the most commonly used provocation methods (skin tests (prick and intradermal), nasal, bronchial, and conjunctival provocations) and how they can be performed. We also discuss the results so far obtained with in vivo testing using recombinant allergens and envisage their future use for immunotherapy.",

However, its broad application is limited by the poor quality of these extracts. Based on recombinant allergens, well-defined allergy vaccines for allergen-specific immunotherapy can be produced. Furthermore, they can be modified to reduce their allergenic activity and to avoid IgE-mediated side effects. Here, we demonstrate that the immunogenicity of two grass pollen-derived hypoallergenic allergen derivatives could be increased by engineering them as a single hybrid molecule. We used a hypoallergenic Phl p 2 mosaic, generated by fragmentation of the Phl p 2 sequence and reassembly of the resulting peptides in an altered order, and a truncated Phl p 6 allergen, to produce a hybrid protein. The hybrid retained the reduction of IgE reactivity and allergenic activity of its components as shown by ELISA and basophil activation assays. Immunization with the hybrid molecule demonstrated the increased immunogenicity of this molecule, leading to higher levels of allergen-specific IgG antibodies compared to the single components. These antibodies could inhibit patients' IgE binding to the wild-type allergens. Thus, the described strategy allows the development of safer and more efficacious vaccines for the treatment of grass pollen allergy.",

With the help of these tools it is possible to reveal the precise reactivity profiles of patients and to uncover and differentiate cross-reactivity from genuine sensitization to an allergen source. Although it has been shown some time ago that it would be possible to replace crude allergen extracts with recombinant allergens for skin prick testing, and even though the use of allergen components can improve routine diagnosis, these tools are still not available for clinical routine applications. The use of provocation tests is a crucial step in the development of new, hypoallergenic vaccines for therapy of allergic disease.

A synthetic signalling cascade engineered within the allergy profiler rewires histamine input to the production of reporter protein, thereby integrating histamine levels in whole-blood samples with remarkable sensitivity and a wide dynamic range, allowing for rapid results or long-term storage of output, respectively. This approach provides non-intrusive allergy profiles for the personalized medicine era. ",

In this respect, recombinant technology has been applied to develop this new generation of molecule-based allergy products. The use of recombinant allergens allows full validation of identity, quantity, homogeneity, structure, aggregation, solubility, stability, IgE-binding and the biologic potency of the products. In contrast, such parameters are extremely difficult to assay and standardize for extract-based products.

A number of molecule-based hypoallergenic preparations have already been successfully evaluated in clinical trials, bringing forward the next generation of allergy vaccines. In this contribution, we review the latest developments in allergen characterization, molecule-based allergy diagnosis, and the application of recombinant allergens in therapeutic setups.

The standardization will furthermore require reagents for which both monospecific, monoclonal, or preferably, recombinant antibodies can be used.

By applying recombinant DNA techniques this goal can be achieved with respect to both, characterization and reproducibility of allergen preparations. As an example, purified recombinant non-fusion Betv1 revealed identical immunological properties with respect to interaction with both, anti-Betv1 antibodies and Betv1-specific T cell clones when compared with natural Betv1 purified from birch pollen. Moreover, cloning of allergens yielded a number of deduced primary structures of allergens, which allows computer-aided comparisons with already known amino acid sequences. Significant sequence similarities with well-described proteins may point at a biological and biochemical function of the cloned allergen, which might be of interest for considerations why a certain protein within an extract represents an allergen. Furthermore, the interaction of small peptides synthesized according to amino acid sequences of cloned allergens with allergen-specific T and B cells can be investigated.

However, for scientists, regulators and food manufacturers there exists a need for acquiring additional data on potential allergenicity of proteins, particularly, biotechnology derived molecules in food products for which minimal or no prior human exposure information is available. Since human exposure testing, while direct, is unacceptable, understanding allergy in animals has been used to investigate the allergic response on a molecular level as well as test the potential in vivo allergenicity of food proteins. Rodents seem to be the most likely candidate for assessing allergenicity. For development of an animal test system for allergenicity characterization and testing, a number of criteria are required for qualification for a model of human allergy including acceptable immunization protocols, allergic response measurements, and for standardization and validation of materials and procedures. If an animal test system can minimally provide a basis for measuring the relative physiological response to known allergens, this should be enough to establish a model that produces a relative measure of potential allergenicity. Our article will consider development of an adequate animal model for allergenicity determination that can be validated as a tool in safety assessments.",

They enhance analytical sensitivity by allowing assays to detect IgE antibodies with a lower limit of quantification (LoQ) to missing or poorly represented allergens in diagnostic extracts that are commonly used in vivo and in vitro. Use of selected allergenic molecules can help improve the clinician's prediction of the risk of a serious allergic reaction to stable allergens. They can provide diagnostic information to determine if a provocation challenge (e.g., oral food challenge) is indeed mandatory or not necessarily needed to support the final diagnostic decision. Suspected cross-reactivity based on the clinical history can be adjudicated by analyzing IgE antibodies to allergenic molecules from cross-reactive protein families. Finally, genuine primary sensitization can be identified by IgE antibody responses that are measured to selected allergenic molecules which are present in only one particular allergen source. After allergen-specific IgE detection, careful interpretation is required by the physician who knows the patient's history. Applying single allergen molecules, positive IgE antibody results are still only relevant in the case of corresponding objective symptoms. Subsequently, clinical relevance of such an IgE antibody test result must be determined by the clinician and not by the test itself. Because of their comprehensive nature, allergen extracts will remain the principal allergen source for diagnostic in vivo and in vitro assays of IgE antibody for many years. Judicious use of individual allergenic molecules in serum IgE assays may provide their most cost effective and efficient application for establishing a definitive diagnosis of human allergic disease.

A hybrid molecule was engineered by PCR-based mending and expression of the cDNAs coding for the 4 major grass pollen allergens and compared with its single components by circular dichroism analysis, T-cell proliferation, ELISA competition, and histamine release assays. Immune responses to the hybrid molecule were studied in BALB/c mice and rat basophil leukemia assays. The hybrid contained most of the B-cell epitopes of grass pollen and could be used to diagnose allergy in 98% (n = 652) of patients allergic to grass pollen. Immunization of mice and rabbits with the hybrid induced stronger and earlier IgG antibody responses than equimolar mixtures of the components, which can be explained by the induction of stronger T-cell responses by the hybrid versus the individual components. IgG antibodies induced by vaccination with the hybrid blocked immediate allergic reactions, as demonstrated by rat basophil degranulation assays in a murine model of grass pollen allergy.

As industrial microbes do not contain pathways to produce medium-chain chemicals, approaches such as overexpression of endogenous enzymes or deletion of competing pathways are not available to the metabolic engineer; instead, fatty acid synthesis and reversed \u03b2-oxidation are manipulated to synthesize medium-chain chemical precursors. Even so, chain lengths remain difficult to control, which means that purification must be used to obtain the desired products, titers of which are typically low and rarely exceed milligrams per liter. By engineering the substrate specificity and activity of the pathway enzymes that generate the fatty acyl intermediates and chain-tailoring enzymes, researchers can boost the type and yield of medium-chain chemicals. Development of technologies to both manipulate chain-tailoring enzymes and to assay for products promises to enable the generation of g/L yields of medium-chain chemicals.",

We engineered microbial production of the full range of even- and odd-chain-length MCFAs and found that MCFA production is limited by rapid, irreversible elongation of their acyl-ACP precursors. To address this limitation, we programmed an essential ketoacyl synthase to degrade in response to a chemical inducer, thereby slowing acyl-ACP elongation and redirecting flux from phospholipid synthesis to MCFA production. Our results show that induced protein degradation can be used to dynamically alter metabolic flux, and thereby increase the yield of a desired compound. The strategy reported herein should be widely useful in a range of metabolic engineering applications in which essential enzymes divert flux away from a desired product, as well as in the production of polyketides, bioplastics, and other recursively synthesized hydrocarbons for which chain-length control is desired.

The relative affinity of these drugs for the glucocorticoid receptor and their ability to stimulate glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transactivation of gene expression were analyzed. All of the test compounds had a higher affinity for the recombinant glucocorticoid receptor than the reference glucocorticoid receptor ligand, dexamethasone (DEX, CAS 50-02-2). In addition, all compounds showed greater potency than dexamethasone in stimulating transcription of a synthetic target gene regulated by a glucocorticoid response element. Of the compounds tested, mometasone furoate had the highest relative binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and triamcinolone acetonide. Similarly, mometasone furoate was the most potent stimulator of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transactivation of gene expression, followed by fluticasone propionate, tri-amcinolone acetonide, and budesonide. These in vitro studies provide a sensitive means to compare the potency of glucocorticoids and may reliably predict the in vivo topical potency of these drugs.",

Mometasone furoate is a topically potent glucocorticoid with a favorable risk-benefit profile. A wide variety of randomized clinical trials have shown the drug to have a clinically beneficial effect on asthma comparable to fluticasone propionate, and to permit the reduction or withdrawal of oral glucocorticoid therapy in patients with asthma. Mometasone furoate has approximately 1% oral bioavailability but does produce systemic glucocorticoid effects from the drug released from the lung and its metabolites.

We have now determined the relative receptor binding affinities of the known metabolite 6beta-OH MF and the degradation product 9,11-epoxy MF to understand their possible contribution to undesirable systemic side effects. In competition experiments with human lung glucocorticoid receptors we have determined the relative receptor affinities (RRA) of these substances with reference to dexamethasone (RRA = 100). We have discovered that 6beta-OH MF and 9,11-epoxy MF display RRAs of 206 +/- 15 and 220 +/- 22, respectively. This level of activity is similar to that of the clinically used inhaled corticosteroid flunisolide (RRA 180 +/- 11). Furthermore we observed that 9,11-epoxy MF is a chemically reactive metabolite. In recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound. Hence, we provide data that might contribute to the understanding of the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical effects of MF.",

Mometasone furoate, a closely related corticosteroid currently available in an intranasal formulation, is being investigated in an oral inhalation formulation for the treatment of asthma. This article reviews available data on the comparative structure-activity relationships, chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate to assess whether claims of differences in the absolute systemic bioavailability of the 2 compounds are supported by the published literature. Information for this review was identified through a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1966 to the present that contained the term mometasone or fluticasone. The resulting list was narrowed by excluding articles dealing with dermatologic applications. A systematic review was conducted of the identified literature pertaining to the molecular structure, topical potency, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of the 2 agents. Additionally, the pharmacology of the 2 moieties was assessed by a review of the available literature on receptor binding affinity, transactivation and transrepression potency, and inhibition of inflammatory-cell cytokine expression. Based on the available data, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate have similar physicochemical properties and structure-activity relationships. When administered intranasally, mometasone furoate is reported to have comparable relative systemic bioavailability to that of fluticasone propionate (mean plasma area under the curve, 123 pmol x h/L vs 112 pmol x h/L, respectively). When administered as a single dose by dry powder inhaler, orally inhaled fluticasone propionate is reported to have a total systemic bioavailability of approximately 17%, whereas that of mometasone furoate is reported to be &lt; 1%. However, the mometasone furoate bioavailability study that reported the latter value used lower drug doses and a less sensitive assay than the fluticasone propionate bioavailability study. When multiple-dose data were used, mometasone furoate had an estimated 11% systemic bioavailability, similar to that of fluticasone propionate. Inhaled fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate appear to have comparable potential systemic absorption and, based on the total systemic bioavailabilities of the parent compounds, have a low potential for systemic side effects at the recommended clinical doses. However, in the case of mometasone furoate, the contribution of the active metabolites to systemic effects has not been adequately assessed.",

Mometasone furoate degradation leads to the formation of two products, D1 and D2 with significant pH dependence.

The biological activity of these degradation products was assessed in rat lung glucocorticoid receptor binding studies. D1 showed 4 fold greater receptor affinity to glucocorticoid receptors compared to dexamethasone. However, the receptor affinity for D2 was a log order lower than that for dexamethasone.

This article presents a concise review of the preclinical and clinical evidence with these new agents and provides data-based guidance for the selection of optimal agents. The survey reveals that mometasone furoate, a new inhaled steroid with topical activity, has the greatest binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, followed by fluticasone propionate, budesonide, triamcinolone acetonide, and dexamethasone. Mometasone furoate also has strong anti-inflammatory activity, with IL-4 and IL-5 inhibition activities equivalent to those of fluticasone propionate. Clinically, both mometasone furoate and fluticasone propionate appear to be well tolerated, to have quick onsets of action, and to be equivalent in efficacy in the treatment of seasonal allergic and perennial rhinitis. Of the intranasal steroids currently available, mometasone furoate has been shown to have the least systemic availability and, consequently, is expected to have the fewest systemic side effects.

All doses of MFNS were well tolerated, and cosyntropin stimulation tests performed before and after treatment found no evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. These results indicate that the most appropriate therapeutic dosage of MFNS in the treatment of SAR in children 6 to 11 years of age is 100 microgram once daily.

Potency is an important aspect of this evolution as many undesirable side effects are associated with use of high-dose glucocorticoids. The side effects can be minimized by highly potent glucocorticoids that achieve the same treatment effects at lower doses. This demand propelled the continuous development of synthetic glucocorticoids with increased potencies, but the structural basis of their potencies is poorly understood. To determine the mechanisms underlying potency, we solved the X-ray structures of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand-binding domain (LBD) bound to its endogenous ligand, cortisol, which has relatively low potency, and a highly potent synthetic glucocorticoid, mometasone furoate (MF). The cortisol-bound GR LBD revealed that the flexibility of the C1-C2 single bond in the steroid A ring is primarily responsible for the low affinity of cortisol to GR. In contrast, we demonstrate that the very high potency of MF is achieved by its C-17\u03b1 furoate group completely filling the ligand-binding pocket, thus providing additional anchor contacts for high-affinity binding. A single amino acid in the ligand-binding pocket, Q642, plays a discriminating role in ligand potency between MF and cortisol. Structure-based design led to synthesis of several novel glucocorticoids with much improved potency and efficacy. Together, these results reveal key structural mechanisms of glucocorticoid potency and provide a rational basis for developing novel highly potent glucocorticoids. ",

FF has shown the highest affinity and selectivity for the glucocorticoid receptors as well the longest tissue retention compared with other available intranasal steroids; these new pharmacologic characteristics provide the basis for its potent and prolonged anti-inflammatory activity at the target site. A literature review achieved through PubMed and Medline research methods supports the clinical efficacy of FF versus placebo in reducing ocular and nasal symptoms related to allergic rhinitis (at the recommended starting doses of 110 \u03bcg once daily for adults and adolescents and 55 \u03bcg once daily for children), with a good safety profile. Moreover, the present review also compares FF with other intranasal steroids: FF represents a molecular evolution of fluticasone propionate (FP), and there is scientific evidence of therapeutic advantages over FP. Fluticasone furoate is a promising molecule in the treatment of allergic rhinitis as it fits fully all the official guidelines' criteria. It is now being considered as a topical steroid that is quite close to the ideal pharmacological model for glucocorticoids due to its satisfying safety/tolerability profile, both in adults and children, leads FF to be considered as a topical steroid that is quite close to the ideal pharmacologic model for glucocorticoids. More studies should be directed to assess the improvement of quality of life in subjects with allergic rhinitis treated with FF, in comparison with other intranasal steroids and even H1-antihistamines; in addition, it could be also interesting to analyze eventual, additional effects of FF in patients with bronchial asthma, which is frequently associated with allergic rhinitis.",

The purpose of intranasal administration is to deliver maximally effective therapy to the affected nasal tissues while minimizing systemic exposure. This article reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of MFNS, highlighting the potential clinical relevance of data concerning its glucocorticoid receptor binding, bioavailability, and metabolism, and its role in activating and suppressing transcription of steroid-dependent genes. A search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (January 1995-July 2007) was undertaken to identify in vitro, preclinical, and clinical studies and review articles concerning MFNS. Searches were also conducted to identify articles on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and adverse effects of the intranasal corticosteroids discussed in this article. Pertinent abstracts from allergy society meetings and data from the author's research experience were also included. The data reviewed indicate that MFNS has a number of qualities that are important in achieving nasal selectivity with minimal systemic adverse effects. For example, MFNS is stable in nasal tissues and is efficiently metabolized in the liver (AUC for a 400-microg dose: 127 fmol/mL x h). Its systemic bioavailability (0.46%) is one of the lowest among currently available intranasal corticosteroids. Bioactive glucocorticoid metabolites have not been observed in humans. The results of immunologic studies suggest that MFNS may reverse the exaggerated T-helper cell type 2 (Th2)-related cytokine response seen in allergic disease through preferential inhibition of Th2 over the T-helper cell type 1-related cytokine. MFNS is an intranasal corticosteroid with a low potential for systemic adverse effects. The efficacy and safety profiles of MFNS seen in clinical use are consistent with its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.",

The pharmacological properties of FF have been investigated using a number of in vitro experimental systems. FF demonstrated very potent glucocorticoid activity in several key pathways downstream of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as follows: the transrepression nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway, the transactivation glucocorticoid response element pathway, and inhibition of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Furthermore, FF showed the greatest potency compared with other glucocorticoids for preserving epithelial integrity and reducing epithelial permeability in response to protease- and mechanical-induced cell damage. FF showed a 30- to &gt;330,000-fold selectivity for GR-mediated inhibition of NF-kappaB vs. the other steroid hormone receptors, substantially better than a number of other clinically used glucocorticoids. In studies examining the respiratory tissue binding properties of glucocorticoids, FF had the largest cellular accumulation and slowest rate of efflux compared with other clinically used glucocorticoids, consistent with greater tissue retention. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of FF was assessed in the Brown Norway rat ovalbumin-induced lung eosinophilial model of allergic lung inflammation. At a dose of only 30 microg, FF achieved almost total inhibition of eosinophil influx in the lung, an inhibition that was greater than that seen with the same dose of fluticasone propionate. In conclusion, the potent and selective pharmacological profile of FF described here could deliver an effective, safe, and sustained topical treatment of respiratory inflammatory diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma.",

This was a single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study with a 7-day run-in period followed by a single-dose administration of medication or placebo in an outdoor park setting. The park site provided an acute exposure to seasonal (tree and grass) pollens. Patients remained in the park of approximately 12 hours after dosing, during which time hourly assessments of SAR symptoms were recorded on a diary card. Two hundred thirty-nine patients with symptoms of SAR entered the study. Patients receiving any concurrent medication for treatment of their symptoms were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either a single dose of MFNS (200 micrograms/or matching placebo nasal spray. Outcome measures included an assessment of overall therapeutic response and change from baseline in total nasal plus non-nasal sign/symptom severity score, total nasal sign/symptom severity score, and total non-nasal sign/symptom severity score. Improvement in total nasal symptom scores, total non-nasal symptom scores, and total nasal plus non-nasal symptom scores were greater and more sustained in patients receiving MFNS than in patients receiving placebo. The mean decrease from baseline in total nasal plus non-nasal symptom scores was significantly greater in MFNS-dosed patients than in placebo-dosed patients at 5 hours after dosing (p &lt; 0.01). The mean decrease from baseline in total nasal symptom scores was significantly greater in MFNS-dosed patients than in placebo-dosed patients at 7 hours after dosing (p &lt; 0.01).

Pharmacologic potency studies using affinity and other assessments have produced similar rank orders of potency, with the most potent being mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and its modification, fluticasone furoate.

The simplest is phenol, . Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule. Phenols are both synthesized industrially and produced by plants and microorganisms. Properties Acidity Phenols are more acidic than typical alcohols. The acidity of the hydroxyl group in phenols is commonly intermediate between that of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids (their pKa is usually between 10 and 12). Deprotonation of a phenol forms a corresponding negative phenolate ion or phenoxide ion, and the corresponding salts are called phenolates or phenoxides (aryloxides according to the IUPAC Gold Book).",

Amino acids are monomer molecules that carries a carboxyl and an amine functional groups; a spectrum of other chemical groups are attached to different amino acids, such as thiols and alcohols. This facilitates the wide range of chemical interactions and therefore molecular recognitions that peptides are capable of. For designer self-assembling peptides both natural and non-natural amino acids are used. They link together in a controlled manner to form short peptides which links to form long polypeptide chains.",

It usually refers to a process not involving the aid of biological processes, which distinguishes it from semisynthesis. Syntheses may sometimes conclude at a precursor with further known synthetic pathways to a target molecule, in which case it is known as a formal synthesis. Total synthesis target molecules can be natural products, medicinally-important active ingredients, known intermediates, or molecules of theoretical interest. Total synthesis targets can also be organometallic or inorganic, though these are rarely encountered. Total synthesis projects often require a wide diversity of reactions and reagents, and subsequently requires broad chemical knowledge and training to be successful.",

The mineralogical form of this compound is called tugarinovite, and is only very rarely found. Structure It crystallizes in a monoclinic cell, and has a distorted rutile, (TiO2) crystal structure. In TiO the oxide anions are close packed and titanium atoms occupy half of the octahedral interstices (holes). In MoO the octahedra are distorted, the Mo atoms are off-centre, leading to alternating short and long Mo \u2013 Mo distances and Mo-Mo bonding. The short Mo \u2013 Mo distance is 251 pm which is less than the Mo \u2013 Mo distance in the metal, 272.5 pm. The bond length is shorter than would be expected for a single bond. The bonding is complex and involves a delocalisation of some of the Mo electrons in a conductance band accounting for the metallic conductivity.",

Structure and properties Mo(CO)6 adopts an octahedral geometry consisting of six rod-like CO ligands radiating from the central Mo atom. A recurring minor debate in some chemical circles concerns the definition of an \"organometallic\" compound. Usually, organometallic indicates the presence of a metal directly bonded via a M\u2013C bond to an organic fragment, which must in turn have a C\u2013H bond. Mo(CO)6 is prepared by the reduction of molybdenum chlorides or oxides under a pressure of carbon monoxide, although it would be unusual to prepare this inexpensive compound in the laboratory. The compound is somewhat air-stable and sparingly soluble in nonpolar organic solvents.",

New materials are supposed to be explored for phosphoproteome analysis. In this work, we first introduced Molybdenum (VI) oxide (MoO<sub3</sub) into phosphoproteome, loading on the graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets forming MoO<sub3</sub/GO nanocomposites by a simple two-step strategy. The GO nanosheets offered MoO<sub3</sub a perfect stable platform for separation and concentration and MoO<sub3</sub exhibited wonderful property in enriching phosphopeptides with highly selectivity and sensitivity on GO nanosheets. Specifically, the as-synthesized MoO<sub3</sub/GO nanocomposites exhibited excellent specificity (\u03b2-casein: BSA=1:1000), high detection sensitivity (1 fmol/mL) and well recovery (91.13%) in enriching phosphopeptides by metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). Moreover, the as-synthesized MoO<sub3</sub/GO nanocomposites provided effective enrichment of phosphopeptides from nonfat milk (a total of twelve phosphopeptides signals) and human serum (a total of four endogenous phosphopeptides signals), displaying great biological compatibility, which demonstrated that the MoO<sub3</sub/GO nanocomposites is a promising candidate in selectively identifying and determining low-abundance phosphorylated peptides in biological sample.",

This review summarizes the updated knowledge about the chemical structures of about forty centelloids, found as minor metabolites in Centella, and all derived from ursane and oleane ring patterns. Similarly, the most recent genetic and enzymatic features involved in their biosynthesis is reviewed, in relation with their biotechnological production developed, either from in vitro plant cultures or undifferentiated cells, in order to be independent of natural sources and to provide a continuous and reliable source of centelloids. Finally, a short survey of the biotransformations of some centelloids, either in animal, human or microorganisms is reviewed.",

It is widely found in Asian countries and is used as source of food and herbs to cure several ailments. A recent study by Hamidpour et al. (2015) had proven that doses of C.asiatica influenced the cell nerves of the pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and other areas, in newborn and adult mice and rats.\n\nThe major bioactive components found in C.asiatica are madecassic acid, asiatic acid, triterpenes with its derivatives such as madecassoside, asiaticoside, and triterpene ester glycosides. These compounds are the core ingredients of numerous compound formulations used for curing gastrointestinal disorders and for revitalizing brain cells (Zahara, Bibi, & Shaista, 2014). To be precise, flavonoids and two other components which are saponosides and diosmin in C. asiatica have been assessed for treating chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in which blood faced difficulties to return to the heart due to abnormal condition of valves in the leg veins (Hamidpour et al., 2015). Flavonoid is an essential compound in a plant for producing the colors required to attract pollinating insects. It can protect the plant against an abiotic and biotic strike, building a defense against fungal and responsible for interaction between the plant and its surroundings. Research has been made on the effects on human health and proven to be useful as anti-cancer agents and inhibition of key enzymes involved in tumor growth (Sak, 2014).",

Although NRF2 activation decreases tumorigenic events in normal cells, accumulating evidence suggests that cancers have broadly selected for NRF2-activating mutations to promote anabolic growth and chemoresistance. Small molecules which inhibit NRF2 activity may therefore offer promise as an alternative anticancer treatment in NRF2 dependent cancers. We have used a high throughput screen to identify small molecules which decrease NRF2 transcriptional activity at antioxidant response element sites. One such molecule, termed AEM1, is capable of broadly decreasing the expression of NRF2 controlled genes, sensitizing A549 cells to various chemotherapeutic agents, and inhibiting the growth of A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. Profiling of multiple cell lines for their responsiveness to AEM1 revealed that AEM1's activities are restricted to cell lines harboring mutations which render NRF2 constitutively active. ",

We hypothesized that a catalytic antioxidant AEOL 10150 [manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (di-N-ethylimidazole) porphyrin] would attenuate changes in brain gene expression in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). C57BL/6J mice were subjected to either sham surgery or 60 min of right MCAO. AEOL 10150 or phosphate-buffered saline was given intravenously 5 min after onset of reperfusion (n = 6 per group). Six hours later, parenchyma within the MCA distribution was harvested. RNA from the six brains in each group was pooled and mRNA expression determined using an Affymetrix murine MG_U74A v. 2.0 expression microarray. Each experiment was performed three times. The largest changes in expression occurred in stress response and inflammatory genes such as heat shock protein, interleukin-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2. Treatment with AEOL 10150 attenuated only the increase in expression of inflammatory genes. This suggests that AEOL 10150 protects brain by attenuating the immune response to ischemia and reperfusion.",

Thirteen animals were irradiated with a single exposure of 11.5 Gy, prescribed to midplane, and delivered with 6 MV photons at a dose rate of 0.8 Gy min. Beginning at 24 h post irradiation, the AEOL 10150 cohort (n = 7) received daily subcutaneous injections of the catalytic antioxidant at a concentration of 5 mg kg for a total of 4 wk. All animals received medical management, including dexamethasone, based on clinical signs during the planned 180-d in-life phase of the study. All decedent study animals were euthanized for failure to maintain saturation of peripheral oxygen &gt; 88% on room air. Exposure of the whole thorax to 11.5 Gy resulted in radiation-induced lung injury in all animals. AEOL 10150, as administered in this pilot study, demonstrated potential efficacy as a mitigator against fatal radiation-induced lung injury. Treatment with the drug resulted in 28.6% survival following exposure to a radiation dose that proved to be 100% fatal in the control cohort (n = 6). Computed tomography scans demonstrated less quantitative radiographic injury (pneumonitis, fibrosis, effusions) in the AEOL 10150-treated cohort at day 60 post-exposure, and AEOL 10150-treated animals required less dexamethasone support during the in-life phase of the study. Analysis of serial plasma samples suggested that AEOL 10150 treatment led to lower relative transforming growth factor-Beta-1 levels when compared with the control animals. The results of this pilot study demonstrate that treatment with AEOL 10150 results in reduced clinical, radiographic, anatomic, and molecular evidence of radiation-induced lung injury and merits further study as a medical countermeasure against radiation-induced pulmonary injury.

Structurally, SOD mimics are characterized by a modified alkylated pyridyl quaternary ammonium group at the meta position of the porphyrin ring. Coordination manganese ions are generally + 3 charges (Fig. 1a). Studies show that the position of the N atom on meso-pyridine significantly affects manganese porphyrin activity and that the more active the pyridine N is, the closer it is to the metal catalyst center [5]. Among the AEOL series compounds, the activities of water-soluble AEOL-10150 compounds deserve attention. Recent reports have shown that AEOL-1114 and AEOL-11203 exhibit good lipophilicity and, upon oral administration, can pass through the blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier (Fig. 1b, c) [6].

However, strategies to design therapeutic ultrasound-responsive functional molecules remain elusive, and rare ultrasound-cleavable chemical bonds have been developed to date. Herein, therapeutic ultrasound (1 MHz)-induced scission of urea bonds for drug release is demonstrated for the first time. Such a transformation has been verified to be initiated by hydroxyl radicals generated in the interior of cavitation bubbles, occurring specifically at the cavitation bubble-liquid interface. A series of urea-bond-containing prodrugs based on methylene blue (MB), namely MBUs, are designed. Upon sonication with low-intensity therapeutic ultrasound, the urea bonds linked with primary amines can be selectively cleaved, and free MB is released in a physiologically relevant environment, accompanied by recovered absorbance, fluorescence, and photosensitivity. Moreover, an FDA-approved alkylating agent (i.e., melphalan) bearing urea bond is also developed (MBU-Mel), successfully achieving ultrasound-triggered drug release in deep-seated cancer cells (mimic with 1 cm pigskin), showing the scalability of our ultrasound-responsive molecule platform in bioactive molecules release. This may set the starting point for therapeutic ultrasound-induced drug release, making a forward step in \"sonopharmacology\".",

The liver assumes an irreplaceable job in the digestion of xenobiotics and therapeutic agents being detoxified and excreted [2]. Chemically-induced hepatic damage is mainly evoked by the metabolic change of chemical into free radicals, which can truly influence cell macromolecules [2]. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced liver damage has been for quite some time utilized as hepatic damage model to evaluate the therapeutic potential of drugs. This model has also been used in mechanical liver injuries that are comparable to human liver disease both in morphology and the biochemical characteristics of cellular lesions [2]. This hepatotoxic agent induces hepatic necrosis through the generation of trichloromethyl free radical under the effect of cytochrome p-450 2E1 [3].\n\nPrevious investigations have reported that a wide spectrum of natural products can prevent or even treat different types of liver diseases [4][5][6][7][8][9]. \u03b2-Aescin (AES) is a triterpene saponin derived from the horse chestnut tree Aesculus hippocastanum L.

There are different formulations of AES in clinical applications, including oral tablets, injections, and topical gel. AES is widely used in the clinical therapy because of its anti-apoptotic, anti-edematous, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects [11][12][13]. Moreover, some studies reported anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress and protective effects of AES against liver damage induced in animals by endotoxin [14], methyl parathion [15] and CCl 4 [16].",

AEBSF is able to act as an inhibitor of O2 \u03ea\u2022 production in this system. Inhibition of XO enzyme activity has also been studied in both cell-free and cell systems. Allopurinol, a potent inhibitor of XO, is clinically used for the treatment for gout by preventing urate from accumulating in joints. Natural polyphenols coumarin (known as 1,2-benzopyrone), consisting of fused benzene and pyrone rings, is an important group of low-molecular weight phenolics and has been widely used for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and strokes\n\n\nActivation of internal antioxidant enzymes\n\nDuring metabolism, ROS such as H2O2, O2\n\n\u03ea\u2022 and \u00b7OH, etc, are produced irreversibly [82]. Thus, methods to reduce the damage induced by oxidative stress are extensively investigated. Intracellular antioxidant enzymes are an important protective mechanism against ROS. These enzymes are produced in the cell and provide an important defence against free radicals. SOD, CAT,\n\n\nGPX, glutathione reductase (GRd), glutathione S-transferase (GST), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), heme oxygenase and biliverdin reductase are the most important antioxidant enzymes. The enzyme SOD converts two O2 \u03ea\u2022 into a H2O2 and an oxygen molecule (Eqs 3 and 4)",

The desired multi-functionality consists of in different methods of antioxidant protection combined with neuroprotection, although the protocol can also be used to pursue other health benefits. The dM38 melatonin derivative is used as a study case to illustrate the protocol in detail. This was found to be a highly promising candidate for the treatment of neurodegeneration, in particular Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. This also has the desired properties of an oral-drug, which is significantly better than Trolox for scavenging free radicals, and has chelates redox metals, prevents the <sup\u25cf</supOH production, via Fenton-like reactions, repairs oxidative damage in biomolecules (lipids, proteins, and DNA), and acts as a polygenic neuroprotector by inhibiting catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and monoamine oxidase B (MAOB). To the best of our best knowledge, CADMA-Chem is currently the only protocol that simultaneously involves the analyses of drug-like behavior, toxicity, manufacturability, versatile antioxidant protection, and receptor-ligand binding affinities. It is expected to provide a starting point that helps to accelerate the discovery of oral drugs with the potential to prevent, or slow down, multifactorial human health disorders.",

One of the two clinical studies of 50 patients (at least 39 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) confirmed that AEOL-10150 did not cause serious side effects and was well tolerated, although skin spots were caused by discoloration and continuous infusion at the injection site [8]. AEOL-10150 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, fast track designation) for treating patients with lung acute radiation syndrome (ARS) ( Table 1). The new and old formulations of AEOL-10150 have been reported to exhibit similar toxicity and pharmacokinetic characteristics, and more importantly, the new formulation of AEOL-10150 exhibits less irritation and has higher bioavailability. Based on prepharmacy, animal-level pharmacodynamics, toxicology, and pharmacokinetics studies, Aeolus announced the launch of a new AEOL-10150 formulation for human phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers and/or to test its potential to treat pulmonary fibrosis patients by evaluating its safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics [4].

AEOL10150 was administered 15 min before RT and 8 h later during the period of RT treatment (5 days), followed by subcutaneous injections for 30 days, twice daily. Lung histology at 26 weeks revealed a significant decrease in lung structural damage and collagen deposition in RT+AEOL10150 (5 mg/kg BID) group, in comparison to RT alone. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed a significant reduction in tissue hypoxia (HIF1alpha, CAIX), angiogenic response (VEGF, CD-31), inflammation (ED-1), oxidative stress (8-OHdG, 3-nitrotyrosine) and fibrosis pathway (TGFbeta1, Smad3, p-Smad2/3), in animals receiving RT+ AEOL10150 (5 mg/kg BID).

Animals, plants and fungi all produce triterpenes, including squalene, the precursor to all steroids. Structures Triterpenes exist in a great variety of structures. Nearly 200 different skeletons have been identified. These skeletons may be broadly divided according to the number of rings present. In general pentacyclic structures (5 rings) tend to dominate. Squalene is biosynthesized through the head-to-head condensation of two farnesyl pyrophosphate units. This coupling converts a pair of C15 components into a C30 product. Squalene serves as precursor for the formation of many triterpenoids, including bacterial hopanoids and eukaryotic sterols. Triterpenoids",

The efficacy and tolerability of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist alosetron hydrochloride in nonconstipated female patients with IBS were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Patients received either 1 mg of alosetron hydrochloride (n = 309) or placebo (n = 317) twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week posttreatment period. Adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort was the primary end point. Secondary end points included improvements in urgency, stool frequency, stool consistency, incomplete evacuation, and bloating. Seventy-one percent of patients were classified as having diarrhea-predominant IBS. Forty-three percent of alosetron-treated patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS reported adequate relief for all 3 months compared with 26% of placebo-treated patients (P&lt;.001; percentage point difference = 17; 95% confidence interval, 8.0-25.4). Improvement with alosetron compared with placebo was observed by the end of the fourth week of treatment and persisted throughout the remainder of treatment. Alosetron significantly decreased urgency and stool frequency and caused firmer stools within 1 week of starting treatment. Effects were sustained throughout treatment and symptoms returned following treatment cessation. No significant improvement in the percentage of days with sense of incomplete evacuation or bloating was observed compared with placebo during the first month of treatment. Constipation was the most commonly reported adverse event.

Serotonin is an important monoamine neurotransmitter that plays a key role in the initiation of peristaltic and secretory refl exes, and in modulation of visceral sensations. Several serotonin receptor subtypes have been characterized, of which 5HT3, 5HT4, and 5HT1b are the most important for GI function. 5HT4 agonists (eg, tegaserod) potentiate peristalsis initiated by 5HT1 receptor stimulation. 5HT4 agonists are therefore useful in constipation predominant form of IBS and in chronic constipation. 5HT3 antagonists (Alosetron and Cilansetron) prevent the activation of 5HT3 receptors on extrinsic afferent neurons and can decrease the visceral pain associated with IBS. These agents also retard small intestinal and colonic transit, and are therefore useful in diarrhea-predominant IBS. Tegaserod has been demonstrated in several randomized, placebo controlled trials to relieve global IBS symptoms as well as individual symptoms of abdominal discomfort, number of bowel movements and stool consistency. Several randomized, controlled trials have shown that alosetron relieves pain, improves bowel function, and provides global symptom improvement in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. However, ischemic colitis and severe complications of constipation have been major concerns leading to voluntary withdrawal of Alosetron from the market followed by remarketing with a comprehensive risk management program.",

New findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptors exist on gut afferent neurones and that their activation by locally released 5-HT leads to visceral nociceptive stimulation, in addition to increased neuronally-mediated motor and secretory activity. If this concept is validated, it will provide a rationale for the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in patients with increased gut motility, reduced fluid absorption and low nociceptive thresholds leading to abdominal pain. Alosetron is a highly selective, potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which is well absorbed with a long pharmacodynamic half-life. Its ability to provide long-lasting blockade of 5-HT3 receptors throughout the body make it an ideal candidate within its class to evaluate the clinical hypothesis that sustained and ubiquitous 5-HT3 receptor blockade is of value in the treatment of IBS.",

Although there is no specific biological marker for the diagnosis of this disorder, recently developed symptom-based criteria provide the tools necessary to make a diagnosis. The precise underlying pathophysiology of IBS remains unknown. However, disturbances in the brain-gut axis involving the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system have emerged as an underlying concept for IBS. In this regard, conventional treatment has been recognised as unsatisfactory for many patients with IBS and novel, neuroenteric modulatory compounds have been introduced for use by clinicians. Specifically, compounds interacting with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype have been demonstrated of benefit in some patients for the treatment of IBS. In this leading article, we present the current data on the pharmacology, clinical trials, indications and adverse effects of alosetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3 antagonist. As a result of the recognition of serious adverse effects, the indication for alosetron has been restricted and it is now indicated only for women with severe diarrhoea-predominant IBS who have symptoms for at least 6 months and who have failed to respond to conventional therapy. Prescribing restrictions and the risk-management programme implemented as required by the US FDA is reviewed along with a summary of the studies to be performed after reintroduction of alosetron to monitor safety.",

It is approximately twice as prevalent in women as it is in men and is among the most common gastrointestinal (GI) disorders encountered in primary care. The aetiology of the disease is poorly understood but may include motility dysregulation, visceral sensitivity, inflammation, bacterial infection, dietary antigens, psychological stress, GI surgery or a gut-brain phenomenon. At present, there is no acceptable treatment for IBS, although recent advances indicate that some relief may be achieved by the administration of compounds that act on 5-HT (serotonin) receptors. This suggestion is the result of numerous studies which have shown that 5-HT may exert a number of diverse effects on human GI tissues. In addition, it has emerged that the levels of the 5-HT metabolite (5-HIAA) are raised in the plasma of IBS patients and that administration of 5-HT-like compounds may mimic the symptoms of IBS. It has therefore been proposed that therapy with compounds that act at 5-HT receptors will return the intestine to normal activity and alleviate the pain experienced by these patients. One compound (alosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) has already been released onto the market but showed benefit in female patients only and only in those whose primary symptom was diarrhoea. In addition, the compound was recently withdrawn following concerns over its safety. The reasons why alosetron only appears to show efficacy in females, why these treatments are only effective in a subset of the population of IBS patients and why alosetron elicits its particular side effect profile have not been elucidated. One further serotonergic compound, tegaserod (Zelmac, a 5-HT4 receptor agonist), has shown promise for the treatment of patients with constipation-predominant IBS and is currently in pre-registration for this indication. It is clear, however, that further research will have to take place before the utility of serotonergic modulation in the treatment of IBS can be fully validated.",

IBS is a common multisymptom disorder that is associated with a high socioeconomic burden. The goal of treatment is to provide rapid and sustained global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS with a single, effective, well-tolerated agent. Traditional treatment options target single symptoms, and many patients are dissatisfied with the level of relief achieved and adverse effects. Research has revealed that serotonin is involved in three major actions in the gut: (1) mediating intestinal motility, (2) mediating intestinal secretion in the GI tract, and (3) modulating perception in the bowels. Serotonin is also a vital link in the brain-gut axis. Alterations in key elements of serotonin signaling have been demonstrated in patients with IBS. Tegaserod, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT(4))-receptor partial agonist, is indicated for use in women with IBS whose primary bowel symptom is constipation. Alosetron, a 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist, is indicated for use in women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS in whom traditional therapies have failed. The clinical usefulness of several other serotonergic agents for IBS is being investigated. The use of serotonergic agents in patients with IBS is based on the critical role that serotonin plays in the maintenance of normal gut function and brain-gut communication. Pharmacologic therapies targeting specific serotonin receptors represent an important step in the management of IBS.",

To investigate the effect of alosetron on whole gut, small bowel and colonic transit in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (Study 1) and healthy volunteers (Study 2). Thirteen patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 12 healthy volunteers. Both studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled with a two-way crossover design, in which each subject received alosetron (2 mg b.d. administered orally) or placebo for 8 days. Mean whole gut transit was determined from the excretion of radio-opaque markers; small bowel transit was determined from rise in breath hydrogen after a meal; and colonic transit and segmental transit were evaluated from abdominal X-ray. In addition, colonic transit was calculated by subtracting small bowel transit time from whole gut transit time. Alosetron increased colonic transit time by prolonging left colonic transit in both patients with irritable bowel syndrome and controls. This resulted in a tendency for the whole gut transit to be delayed in irritable bowel syndrome patients (P=0.128), which was confirmed in controls (P=0.047).

We hypothesized that ME3412, 5-chloro-2-(1,4-diazacycloheptan-1-yl)-7-methylbenzoxazole, a novel partial agonist of the 5-HT(3) receptor, would minimize constipation without reducing antidiarrhoeal activity.

A 5-HT(3) receptor agonist, 2-methyl-5-HT, caused contractile response in the isolated guinea-pig ileum and accelerated secretion in the guinea-pig colonic mucosal preparation. ME3412 and 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, alosetron, antagonized the 2-methyl-5-HT-induced responses with similar potency in insurmountable and surmountable manner, respectively. ME3412 caused weak agonism in isolated ileum strips and also in the colonic mucosa with intrinsic activity of 0.09 and 0.59, respectively.

The inhibition of EFS contractions was not limited to atropine-sensitive events, as non-cholinergic excitatory EFS evoked contractions were also inhibited. Additionally, alosetron at high concentrations (&gt; 30 microM) directly altered bethanechol stimulated contractions.

Alosetron administered via the duodenum also inhibited this reflex, with duration of action that was significantly longer than that seen with ondansetron (120-60 min, respectively, n = 6). Alosetron had no significant effect on normal small intestinal propulsion in the rat, but fully reversed the increase in intestinal propulsion (96%, n = 3) produced by egg albumin challenge. Alosetron is a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist which normalizes perturbed small intestinal propulsion.

The search terms were alosetron, 5-HT, irritable bowel, functional bowel diseases, and irritable colon. No language restriction was applied. The data were analyzed in terms of 2 main outcomes: global improvement in IBS symptoms and adequate relief of IBS pain and discomfort. Eight multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trials met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The studies included 4,170 patients with IBS (80% female) who were randomized to receive either alosetron or placebo. All patients met the Rome criteria for IBS, and all subtypes of IBS were represented. Most patients had diarrhea-predominant IBS; only 2.6% of patients had constipation-predominant IBS.

IBS adversely impacts quality of life and medical expenditures, with significant costs arising from healthcare visits and reduced workplace productivity.

In real-world clinical practice, patients receiving alosetron had significant improvements in multiple IBS-related clinical parameters, including the new FDA IBS-diarrhea composite endpoint, lower gastrointestinal symptoms, fecal incontinence, and quality of life.

It is a paracrine messenger utilized by enterochromaffin (EC) cells, which function as sensory transducers. Serotonin activates intrinsic and extrinsic primary afferent neurons to, respectively, initiate peristaltic and secretory reflexes and to transmit information to the central nervous system. Serotonin is also a neurotransmitter utilized by a system of long descending myenteric interneurons. Serotonin is synthesized through the actions of 2 different tryptophan hydroxylases, TpH1 and TpH2, which are found, respectively, in EC cells and neurons. Serotonin is inactivated by the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT)-mediated uptake into enterocytes or neurons. The presence of many serotonin receptor subtypes enables selective drugs to be designed to therapeutically modulate gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and sensation. Current examples include tegaserod, a 5-HT(4) partial agonist, which has been approved for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation in women and for chronic constipation in men and women. The 5-HT(3) antagonists, granisetron and ondansetron, are useful in combating the nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy, and alosetron is employed in the treatment of IBS with diarrhea. Serotonergic signaling abnormalities have also been putatively implicated in the pathogenesis of functional bowel diseases. Other compounds, for which efficacy has not been rigorously established, but which may have value, include tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors to combat IBS, and 5-HT(1) agonists, which enhance gastric accommodation, to treat functional dyspepsia.

However, no direct mortality can be attributed to functional disorders. Hence, drug treatment of IBS must not only be highly efficient to relieve clinical symptoms but also very safe for the long-term use in humans with such chronic disorders. Alosetron is a potent and highly selective serotonin 5-HT(3 )receptor antagonist that in large randomised controlled clinical trials has been shown to be clinically efficient in female patients with diarrhoea-predominant IBS. The efficacy data along with a low number of serious adverse effects in the preclinical and clinical trials suggested a favourable benefit/risk profile that led to US FDA approval of alosetron in early 2000. However, postmarketing experience has proven that several serious adverse effects, including death, occurred in the treated patient population, which resulted (for a time) in the withdrawal of alosetron from the US market by the producer (GlaxoSmithKline). In the meantime, both public pressure and the proposal of a careful postmarketing surveillance have led the FDA to re-approve alosetron to the US drug market under severe restrictions. These restrictions aim to ensure a safer use of the drug with a more favourable safety profile. Under these restrictions, however, it is not very likely that alosetron will become a major treatment option for many patients, but presumably the continued use of this first selective serotonin antagonist will open an avenue for the development of similar drugs with more favourable benefit/risk profiles in the near future.",

Serotonergic agents, such as alosetron (a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) and tegaserod (a selective 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist), provide global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS with diarrhoea and IBS with constipation, respectively, and represent important additions to the IBS treatment armamentarium.",

Fifty-two non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients (28 female) were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with alosetron (1-4 mg b.d.). Thirty-seven patients completed both brain scans following randomization. Rectosigmoid stimulation was performed with a computer-controlled barostat. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow were assessed using H215O positron emission tomography. Stimulus ratings and changes in gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using verbal descriptor scales. Alosetron, but not placebo, treatment was associated with a decrease in symptom ratings, and reductions in emotional stimulus ratings. Compared to baseline, alosetron treatment was associated with reduced regional cerebral blood flow in bilateral frontotemporal and various limbic structures, including the amygdala. Compared to placebo, decreases in activity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, hypothalamus and infragenual cingulate gyrus were significantly greater after alosetron. In non-constipated irritable bowel syndrome patients, 3 weeks of treatment with a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist decreases brain activity in response to unanticipated, anticipated and delivered aversive rectal stimuli in structures of the emotional motor system, and this is associated with a decrease in gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is a serotonin receptor type 3 antagonist approved in early 2000 for use in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Initial use was widespread, but infrequent serious adverse events of ischemic colitis and severe constipation-related complications prompted alosetron's voluntary withdrawal from the US market in November 2000. Unprecedented public request prompted its reintroduction in 2002 under a Risk Management Plan, including a more restricted indication and a Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Despite these measures, the use of alosetron has been very limited since its reintroduction. Possible deterrents to its use include concerns over safety and the possible medical-legal implications raised by the Risk Management Plan. It is also possible that changes in the natural history and/or diagnosis of IBS-D have reduced the target population. Given the unique regulatory history of alosetron, these issues continue to engender controversy. This article profiles these concerns and reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety, and post-marketing experience with alosetron. Myths and misconceptions related to alosetron use, or lack thereof, are addressed to provide the reader with the evidence needed to make informed treatment decisions for their female patients with severe IBS-D.",

However, whether or not the therapeutic efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has gender difference is uncertain. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, comparative study was conducted to evaluate the effect of novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ramosetron hydrochloride, in male and female patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. 418 subjects were randomized (109 subjects: placebo, 105 subjects: 1 microg, 103 subjects: 5 microg, and 101 subjects: 10 microg) and administered the study drug once daily. The monthly responder rates of 'Patient-reported global assessment of relief of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms' in the 5- and 10-microg ramosetron hydrochloride-administered groups were higher than the placebo group (26.92, 42.57, and 43.01% for placebo, 5 and 10 microg). Moreover, the difference of the responder rate in comparison with the placebo group was similar in males and females. As for safety, there was tolerability at doses up to 10 microg.

The triterpenes were designated under a series of names including rubiarbonol, rubiarbonone, rubiarboside, rubiprasin and rubianol; among them, oleanane-type and fernane-type triterpenes accounted for overwhelming majority. Rubia cyclopeptides had narrower sources and existed in only 3 species including R. cordifolia, R. yunnanensis and R. akane. These terpenes and cyclopeptides, especially the latter, possessed excellent anticancer effects; maslinic acid, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid and several cyclopeptides containing RA-V and RA-VII drew relatively more attention than any other compound. From Table 3 and Additional file 1: Figure S1, it may be inferred that the Rubia triterpenes owning a free hydroxyl group on third carbon atom exhibited relatively strong inhibitory on cell lines; besides, fernane-type triterpenes possessed promising antioxidant effects. As for Rubia cyclopeptides, increase in the length of carbon side chain at residues 1, 2 and introduction of polar groups at residue 2 might decrease structure's cytotoxicity; N-methyl amide bond between residues 2 and 3, together with aromatic side chain of residue 3 over \u03b2-turn played pivotal role in the antitumor activities. Beyond that, the orientation of one or both of the Tyr-5 and Tyr-6 phenyl rings was also essential to express activities, while structures possessing two rings formed between Tyr-5 and residue 6 via a phenolic oxygen linkage and a new carbon bond only possessed moderate cytotoxicities.",

Up to 2012, researchers have identified 5 monoterpenes (1-5) distributed in 3 species including R. cordifolia, R. tinctorum and R. peregrina [7][8][9]; and it's just the continuous studies of the ethyl acetate fraction of R. cordifolia that resulted in the isolation of the monoterpenoid (5). More detailed information of monoterpenes is involved in the following Table  and Figure. Pentacyclic triterpenes Most of Rubia pentacyclic triterpenes came from three species including R. schumanniana, R. peregrina, and R. yunnanensis, especially the latter. R. yunnanensis is known as \"Xiao-Hong-Shen\", which is endemic to China and has been served as an alternative for R. cordifolia; it has a long history of medicinal application in China. The aforementioned three Rubia species were rich sources for pentacyclic triterpenes. No report could be available on triterpene derivatives of Genus Rubia until 1981, when S. K. Talapatra etc. got Rubiacoumaric acid (6) and Rubiafolic acid (7) from R. cordifolia [10]. Several years after the discovery of the first two triterpenes, rubiprasins A-C and rubiarbonols A-F were identified from the same species [11,12]. The subsequent reported pentacyclic triterpenes were mainly designated under a series of names such as rubiarbonol, rubiarbonone, rubiarboside, rubiprasin and rubianol. It seemed that compounds named rubiarbonones, rubiarbosides, rubianols and rubianosides mainly existed in R. yunnanensis [13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. Friedelinol-type triterpene (63) that belonged to arborinane-type derivatives was previously isolated from the family Rubiaceae, but it's the first report for the isolation from the Genus Rubia [23].

Such deleterious proliferation and migration events are triggered by cytokines and growth factors, and among them, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is recognized as the most potent inducer. Despite the genus Rubia being researched to identify valuable commercial and medicinal virtues, Rubia philippinensis has rarely been investigated. Nine arborinane-type triterpenoids (1-9) were identified from this underutilized plant species. In particular, 4 was identified as the first arborinane derivative carrying a ketocarbonyl motif at C-19. The presence of the cyclopentanone moiety and the associated configurational assignment were determined by utilizing NOE and coupling constant analysis. These compounds were assessed for their inhibitory potential on PDGF-induced proliferation and the migration of VSMCs. Treatment with 5 \u03bcM compound 5 (62.6 \u00b1 10.7%) and compound 9 (41.1 \u00b1 4.7%) impeded PDGF-stimulated proliferation without exerting cytotoxicity. Compound 7 exhibited antimigration activity in a dose-dependent manner (38.5 \u00b1 3.0% at 10 \u03bcM, 57.6 \u00b1 3.2% at 30 \u03bcM).

To evaluate antihyperlipidemic activity of the roots of Rubia. yunnanensis Diels and to identify active compounds from the active fraction. Antihyperlipidemic effects of extract and compounds of the roots of Rubia yunnanensis were studied in HepG2 cells and in vivo model in olive oil-loaded mice. The isolation of compounds was conducted using various chromatographic methods and the structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by NMR and MS techniques. Methanol extract and ethyl acetate fraction of Rubia yunnanensis potently decreased the triglycerides accumulation in HepG2 cells and the methanol extract of Rubia yunnanensis (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the TG elevation in a dose dependent manner in olive oil-loaded mice. Through various chromatographic methods, twenty-three compounds (1-23) were isolated in which arborinane-type triterpenoids and a free anthraquinone potently inhibited TG levels in HepG2 cells. Arborinane-type triterpenoids, especial rubiarbonone C (16) and an anthraquinone, 2-methyl-1, 3, 6-trihydroxy-9, 10-anthraquinone (MTHA) (22) were identified as the main active compounds responsible for antihyperlipidemic activity. Based on these findings, we proposed that the extract of Rubia yunnanensis and its active components, arborinane-type triterpenoids and the free anthraquinone might be beneficial in the treatment and prevention of hyperlipidemic disease.",

Numerous experimental data verified that pentacyclic triterpenes possessed potent advantage on the aspects of antitumor, antiinflammatory, protecting liver, anti-HIV effects [70], while the most significant advantage of plant cyclopeptides was their underlying mechanisms of antitumor effects. As the two major ingredients existed in those Rubia plants, pentacyclic triterpenes and cyclopeptides were becoming a hot topic over the past twenty years for their remarkable effects. The following contents aims to offer the detailed statements of pharmacological activities of Rubia terpenes and cyclopeptides, especially their anticancer and antioxidant effects. Finally, all the bioactive terpenes and cyclopeptides together with the sketchy mechanisms are collected in Table 3.\n\nAnticancer effects of Rubia terpenes and Rubia cyclopeptides Cytotoxicity and inhibitory on cell lines Rubiarbonols A (16) and F (21), rubiarbonone C (27), and rubianol-c (42) exhibited cytotoxic effects in the MTT assay and they could also inhibit NO production [19].

Compounds 22, 54, 55, 58 and 62 had inhibition on A549, Hela and SMMC-7721; however, the data were not very satisfactory [22]. Rubiarbonol A (16) was reported to have relatively strong cytotoxicity against HT-29; compared rubiarbonols A and B, introduction of the hydroxyl group on C-28 seemed to enhance cytotoxicity, especially on HT-29. Besides, compound 15 exhibited potent bioactivities against A549, SK-OV-3, SK-MEL-2, MES-SA and HCT-15 [36].",

CHK1/CHK2 plays a crucial role in the repair of recombination-mediated double-stranded DNA breaks. The other important functions performed by these proteins are the beginning of DNA replication, the stabilization of replication forks, the resolution of replication stress and the coordination of mitosis, even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Prexasertib (LY2606368) is a small ATP-competitive selective inhibitor of CHK1 and CHK2. In preclinical studies, prexasertib in monotherapy has shown to induce DNA damage and tumor cells apoptosis. The preclinical data and early clinical studies advocate the use of prexasertib in solid tumors both in monotherapy and in combination with other drugs (antimetabolites, PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy).

We evaluated prexasertib (LY2606368), a small-molecule CHK1 inhibitor currently in clinical testing, in multiple preclinical models of pediatric cancer. Following an initial assessment of prexasertib activity, this study focused on the preclinical models of neuroblastoma.<bExperimental Design:</b We evaluated the antiproliferative activity of prexasertib in a panel of cancer cell lines; neuroblastoma cell lines were among the most sensitive. Subsequent Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses measured DNA damage and DNA repair protein activation. Prexasertib was investigated in several cell line-derived xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma.<bResults:</b Within 24 hours, single-agent prexasertib promoted \u03b3H2AX-positive double-strand DNA breaks and phosphorylation of DNA damage sensors ATM and DNA-PKcs, leading to neuroblastoma cell death. Knockdown of CHK1 and/or CHK2 by siRNA verified that the double-strand DNA breaks and cell death elicited by prexasertib were due to specific CHK1 inhibition. Neuroblastoma xenografts rapidly regressed following prexasertib administration, independent of starting tumor volume. Decreased Ki67 and increased immunostaining of endothelial and pericyte markers were observed in xenografts after only 6 days of exposure to prexasertib, potentially indicating a swift reduction in tumor volume and/or a direct effect on tumor vasculature.<bConclusions:</b Overall, these data demonstrate that prexasertib is a specific inhibitor of CHK1 in neuroblastoma and leads to DNA damage and cell death in preclinical models of this devastating pediatric malignancy. <iClin Cancer Res; 23(15); 4354-63. \u00a92017 AACR</i.",

The best CoMFA and CoMSIA models exhibited cross-validated correlation coefficient (q2) values of 0.631 and 0.585, and non-cross-validated correlation coefficient (r2) values of 0.933 and 0.900, respectively. CoMFA and CoMSIA models showed reasonable external predictabilities (r2 pred) of 0.672 and 0.513, respectively. A satisfactory performance in the various internal and external validation techniques indicated the reliability and robustness of the best model. Docking studies were performed to explore the binding mode of inhibitors inside the active site of Chk1. Molecular docking revealed that hydrogen bond interactions with Lys38, Glu85 and Cys87 are essential for Chk1 inhibitory activity. The binding interaction patterns observed during docking studies were complementary to 3D-QSAR results.

Here we investigated the combination of prexasertib mesylate monohydrate (LY2606368), a Chk1 and Chk2 inhibitor, and a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, in HGSOC cell lines (OVCAR3, OV90, PEO1 and PEO4) using clinically attainable concentrations.

Treatment with olaparib in <iBRCA</i wild type HGSOC cells caused formation of Rad51 foci, whereas the combination treatment with prexasertib inhibited transnuclear localization of Rad51, a key protein in homologous recombination repair.

Previous studies of the CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib demonstrated activity across multiple cancer types. Therefore, we sought to (1) identify markers of prexasertib sensitivity and (2) define the molecular mechanism(s) of intrinsic and acquired resistance using preclinical models representing multiple tumor types.

Functional RNAi studies supported a causal role of replication fork components as modulators of prexasertib response.

The monotherapy with Chk1 inhibitors seems to be endowed with antitumor activity against cancer cells characterized by specific defects in the DNA damage machinery or characterized by elevated levels of oncogene-induced replication stress. In this biological framework Chk1 neutralization represents a synthetic lethality-based therapeutic approach. Moreover, a dual targeting of the DNA damage machinery has been proposed envisioning the association of Chk1 abrogation with poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors. The spectrum of antitumor properties of Chk1 antagonists is completed by the activity against cancer stem cells, the prominent tumorigenic population that is equipped to survive stressful conditions through multiple and interconnected mechanisms. Although the clinical development of the first generation of Chk1 antagonists was hindered by off-target effects and an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile, a new wave of early clinical trials with more selective compounds are currently being carried out.

CHK1 regulates cell cycle checkpoints following genotoxic stress to prevent the entry of cells with damaged DNA into mitosis and coordinates various aspects of DNA repair. Accordingly, CHK1 has become a target of considerable interest in oncology. CHK1 inhibitors potentiate the efficacy of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics by abrogating CHK1-mediated cell cycle arrest and preventing repair of damaged DNA. In addition, CHK1 inhibitors interfere with the biological role of CHK1 as a principal regulator of the cell cycle that controls the initiation of DNA replication, stabilizes replication forks, and coordinates mitosis. Since these functions of CHK1 facilitate progression through an unperturbed cell cycle, CHK1 inhibitors are being developed not only as chemopotentiators, but also as single-agent therapies. This review is intended to provide information on the current progress of CHK1 inhibitors in pre-clinical and clinical development and will focus on mechanisms of single-agent activity and potential strategies for patient tailoring and combinations with non-genotoxic agents.

In this study, biopsies of treated patients and cell line models were used to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance to CHK1i.

DNA damage can activate the Chk1 protein through the ATR/Chk1 signal transduction pathway. Consequently, the activated Chk1 causes cell-cycle arrest and repairs gene transcription, which ensures the integrity and stability of the genome [3,4]. Cancer cells are accompanied by genetic deficiencies in the P53 gene, leading to the lack of the G1 cell-cycle checkpoint [5]. Therefore, most cancer cells repair themselves through the S and G2-M checkpoint. Chk1 inhibition can disable the function of the S and G2 checkpoint, thereby impeding cancer cell repair and resulting in mitosis disorders, and even cell death or apoptosis. Normal cells possess a relatively complete cycle checkpoint function and are relatively insensitive to Chk1 inhibitors [6]. Currently, clinical studies evaluated several Chk1 inhibitors (Figure 1), such as UCN-01 [7], PF-477736 [8], and AZD7762 [9,10]. These inhibitors, in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, can improve the effect of cancer treatment. For example, AZD7762 can enhance the selectivity of gemcitabine for P53-deficient cells.

This has led to the hypothesis that S and G(2)-M checkpoint abrogation may selectively enhance genotoxic cell killing in a p53-deficient background, as normal cells would be rescued at the G(1)-S checkpoint.

Chk1 is considered a good molecular target to inhibit, in combination with other anticancer agents, to increase the sensitivity of treatment, especially in tumors with a defective G 1 checkpoint. Experimental evidence highlights the essential role of Chk1 in normal and cancer cells even under unstressed conditions, especially in controlling DNA replication and cell division.

The theory relies on the observation that the majority of tumors are deficient in the G1-DNA damage checkpoint pathway resulting in reliance on S and G2 checkpoints for DNA repair and cell survival. The S and G2 checkpoints are regulated by checkpoint kinase 1, a serine/threonine kinase that is activated in response to DNA damage; thus, inhibition of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling impairs DNA repair and increases tumor cell death. Normal tissues, however, have a functioning G1 checkpoint signaling pathway allowing for DNA repair and cell survival. Here, we describe the preclinical profile of AZD7762, a potent ATP-competitive checkpoint kinase inhibitor in clinical trials. AZD7762 has been profiled extensively in vitro and in vivo in combination with DNA-damaging agents and has been shown to potentiate response in several different settings where inhibition of checkpoint kinase results in the abrogation of DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. Dose-dependent potentiation of antitumor activity, when AZD7762 is administered in combination with DNA-damaging agents, has been observed in multiple xenograft models with several DNA-damaging agents, further supporting the potential of checkpoint kinase inhibitors to enhance the efficacy of both conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy and increase patient response rates in a variety of settings.",

In fact, ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs along with many other DNA damaging reagents are expected to cause cell cycle arrest by various cell cycle checkpoints as a normal outcome in both normal and tumor cells [2]. Cell cycle checkpoints will temporarily stop the progression of cell cycle, to allow time for the repair of the DNA damage in order to maintain the genomic integrity and the survival of the cells. From a therapeutic point of view, Chk1-mediated S or G2 checkpoint arrests in tumor cells will limit the efficacy of radiation therapy and cyctotoxic drugs leading to drug resistance. On the other hand, it has been suggested that Chk1 inhibition would preferentially sensitize tumors to DNA damaging agents , where 50% of the tumor cells are stated to be deficient in the protein P53 that causes DNA-damage-induced G1 arrest, but has minor role on the S or G2 checkpoints [3,4]. Cells depend normally on arrest at G1 phase for repair of DNA damage, while p53-mutated tumor cells depend on the cell cycle arrest and consequent DNA damage repair by S and G2 checkpoints action due to their incapability of G1 arrest. As a result, specific inhibition of S and G2 arrests through inhibition of Chk1 is expected to selectively drive p53-deficient tumor cells to enter mitotic catastrophe and finally apoptosis following DNA damage [5,6]. This assumption has been confirmed recently by the reported increase in effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents when given to p53-mutated tumor cells after knocking down their Chk1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Chk1 antisense technique [7][8][9] , or even if inhibited by a natural product such as 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) [10,11], which proves Chk1 to be a target for selective chemosensitization. The continued interest in designing new Chk1 inhibitors prompted us to explore the possibility of developing ligand-based three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore(s) integrated within self-consistent QSAR model. This approach avoids the pitfalls of structure-based techniques; furthermore, the pharmacophore model(s) can be used as 3D search queries",

To prepare a screen of large chemical libraries, we purified the full-length and the catalytic domain versions of human Chk1. We characterized their properties and then selected full-length Chk1 as the variant most suitable for screening. We then identified and characterized structurally different Chk1 inhibitors in cell based-assays by measuring cytotoxicity and checkpoint bypass activity. We treated human cells with topoisomerase I inhibitors and demonstrated that at the time of Chk1 inhibitor addition, the cells have damaged DNA and activated Chk1. One Chk1 inhibitor, the indolocarbazole S27888, was active in the checkpoint bypass assay. Knowing that the protein kinase inhibitory properties are different for each inhibitor, it seems that only a limited range of inhibitory activity is tolerated by cells. Chk1 has an essential role in determining how cancer cells respond to genotoxic treatments, therefore, inhibitors of this protein kinase are of great medical interest.",

This leads to the hypothesis that inhibition of ChK1 might enhance the effectiveness of DNA-damaging therapies in the treatment of cancer. Lead compound 1 (GNE-783), the prototype of the 1,7-diazacarbazole class of ChK1 inhibitors, was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and unsuitable for development. A campaign of analogue synthesis established SAR delineating ChK1 and AChE activities and allowing identification of new leads with improved profiles. In silico docking using a model of AChE permitted rationalization of the observed SAR. Compounds 19 (GNE-900) and 30 (GNE-145) were identified as selective, orally bioavailable ChK1 inhibitors offering excellent in vitro potency with significantly reduced AChE activity. In combination with gemcitabine, these compounds demonstrate an in vivo pharmacodynamic effect and are efficacious in a mouse p53 mutant xenograft model. ",

Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitors are being trialled for their efficacy in enhancing conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but their effectiveness as single agents is not known. We have examined the effectiveness of two novel Chk1 selective inhibitors, AR323 and AR678, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and normal cell types. We demonstrate that these drugs display single-agent activity, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. The drugs produce cytotoxic effects in cell lines that are most sensitive to these drugs, whereas normal cells are only sensitive to these drugs at the higher concentrations where they have cytostatic activity. The cytotoxic effect is the consequence of inhibition of S-phase Chk1, which drives cells prematurely from late S phase into an aberrant mitosis and results in either failure of cytokinesis or cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. The sensitivity to the Chk1 inhibitors was correlated with the level of endogenous DNA damage indicating replicative stress. Chk1 inhibitors are viable single-agent therapies that target melanoma cells with high levels of endogenous DNA damage. This sensitivity suggests that Chk1 is a critical component of an adaptation to replicative stress in these cells. It also suggests that markers of DNA damage may be useful in identifying the melanomas and potentially other tumour types that are more likely to be sensitive to Chk1 inhibitors as single agents.",

Inhibiting Chk1 disrupts the S and G2 checkpoints, sensitizing tumor cells, particularly those lacking the p53 gene, more susceptible to different DNA-damaging agents. The referenced study delves deeper into the exploration of urea-based inhibitors targeting Chk1 kinase within a macrocyclic ring system, ultimately resulting in the discovery of compound 1 (5 5 -chloro-6,12-dioxa-2,4-diaza-1(2,6)-pyrazina-5(1,2)-benzenacyclododecaphan-3-one) that was cocrystallized with Chk1 (PDB ID: 2E9U) [14,25].\n\nCyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are a type of serine/threonine kinases that depend on the association with a cyclin regulatory subunit to become active.

There are several clinical trials focused on evaluating encorafenib in various cancer types, the majority of them in combination with other anticancer agents (Table S1). The combination of encorafenib with binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, was approved by FDA in 2018 for patients with advanced melanoma harboring the BRAF V600 mutation [100]. In 2020, the FDA granted approval for the utilization of encoratinib in combination with cetuximab to treat metastatic colorectal cancer characterized by the BRAF-V600E mutation, following prior treatment [101].\n\n\nInhibitors of Various Other Serine/Threonine Kinases\n\nThis section groups a series of pyrazole derivatives that inhibit various serine/threonine kinases.

The IC 50 value on CHK1 is less than 1 nM, and the assay on a broad panel of other 224 PKs revealed that only CHK2 and the RSK family kinases presented an IC 50 under 10 nM (8 nM and 9 nM, respectively) [103].\n\nStructurally, it contains an aminopyrazine core and a 2,6 dialkoxy phenyl group linked by the pyrazole ring. A molecular docking study revealed that prexasertib develops four binding interactions with CHK1 (pdb 7AKM), a strong hydrogen donor bond with Glu91, two weak hydrogen acceptor bonds toward Lys38 and Lys132, and a hydrophobic interaction with Leu15 [104].",

Its mechanism of action is mainly to activate the key checkpoints (S, G 2 ) of mitosis of tumor cells and repair damaged tumor cells. Inhibition of ChK1 can make tumor cells sensitive to various DNA damaging agents and cannot perform DNA repair [27][28][29]. The inhibition of Chk1 may significantly improve the efficacy and selectivity of DNA-damaging agents in the clinic [30][31][32][33]. Therefore, many classes of Chk1 inhibitors have been reported. In 2007, Tao et al. discovered a series of novel macrocyclic inhibitors based on the urea scaffold [34].\n\nFirstly, two potent and selective urea-based Chk1 inhibitors, 11a and 11b, were selected as lead compounds ( Figure 13) [35,36]. Subsequently, the modification of the C6 -position in the pyrazinyl ring resulted in compounds 11c (IC 50 = 26 nM) and 11d (IC 50 = 22 nM). These two compounds can abrogate the cell cycle checkpoints and significantly potentiate the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase inhibitors. Among the lactams, the analog 10g retains biological activity and physical properties while improving computational properties such as TPSA and clogP. More important, compound 10g showed only about 7% inhibition of channel hERG at 11 \u03bcM, which was significantly improved compared to compound 10c, which inhibited hERG by up to 78% at the same concentration. In addition, 10g has significant anti-proliferative activity against various other cell lines.\n\n\nStructure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Potent and Selective Macrocyclic Checkpoint Kinase 1 Inhibitors",
