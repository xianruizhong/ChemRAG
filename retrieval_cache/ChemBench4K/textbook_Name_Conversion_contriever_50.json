As the lithium salt of the weak acid diisopropylamine, $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}=36$, LDA can readily deprotonate most carbonyl compounds. It is easily prepared by reaction of butyllithium with diisopropylamine and is soluble in organic solvents because of its two alkyl groups.\n\n\nMany types of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, esters, thioesters, acids, and amides, can be converted into enolate ions by reaction with LDA. TABLE 22.1 lists the approximate $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ values of different types of carbonyl compounds and shows how these values compare to other acidic substances we've seen.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

As the lithium salt of the weak acid diisopropylamine, $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}=36$, LDA can readily deprotonate most carbonyl compounds. It is easily prepared by reaction of butyllithium with diisopropylamine and is soluble in organic solvents because of its two alkyl groups.\n\n\nMany types of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, esters, thioesters, acids, and amides, can be converted into enolate ions by reaction with LDA.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Some symbols are derived from the common name of the element; others are abbreviations of the name in another language. Most symbols have one or two letters, but three-letter symbols have been used to describe some elements that have atomic numbers greater than 112 . To avoid confusion with other notations, only the first letter of a symbol is capitalized. For example, Co is the symbol for the element cobalt, but CO is the notation for the compound carbon monoxide, which contains atoms of the elements carbon (C) and oxygen (O).

As the lithium salt of the weak acid diisopropylamine, $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}=36$, LDA can readily deprotonate most carbonyl compounds. It is easily prepared by reaction of butyllithium with diisopropylamine and is soluble in organic solvents because of its two alkyl groups.\n\n\nMany types of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, esters, thioesters, acids, and amides, can be converted into enolate ions by reaction with LDA.

As the lithium salt of the weak acid diisopropylamine, $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}=36$, LDA can readily deprotonate most carbonyl compounds. It is easily prepared by reaction of butyllithium with diisopropylamine and is soluble in organic solvents because of its two alkyl groups.\n\n\nMany types of carbonyl compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, esters, thioesters, acids, and amides, can be converted into enolate ions by reaction with LDA. TABLE 22.1 lists the approximate $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ values of different types of carbonyl compounds and shows how these values compare to other acidic substances we've seen.
