The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer.

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms. The k pathway involves attack by CN(-) at the copper site followed by dissociation of the thiolate. The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver.

The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

Peripheral ligation is provided by chelating bpy and syn,syn-bridging RCO(2)(-) groups. The Co(III) atoms are six-coordinate and approximately octahedral. Solution studies show that the diprotonated species is a strong diprotic acid analogous to H(2)SO(4); the first deprotonation goes to completion, but the monoprotonated species is a weak acid and is in equilibirium with the nonprotonated species. pH studies in aqueous solution yield a pK(a2) value of 3.15 for the second deprotonation. Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution.

No insertion of the substrate into the Zr-C6F5 bond is observed in 8 (at -38 degrees C) or 10 (up to 22 degrees C). The allyltrimethylsilane ligand in 10 undergoes nondissociative alkene face exchange (\"alkene flipping\", i.e., exchange of the Cp2Zr(C6F5)+ unit between the two alkene enantiofaces without alkene dissociation), with a first-order rate constant kflip = 23(1) s-1 (C6D5Cl, -38 degrees C). 10 also undergoes slower reversible decomplexation of the alkene (kdissoc = 5.0(8) s-1; C6D5Cl, -38 degrees C).",

The solid-state structure of the compound with Y = CN, X = i-Pr was found to be that of the enol. The reasons for the stability of the enols were discussed in terms of polar and resonance effects. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds result in a very low delta(OH) and contribute to the stability of the enols and are responsible for the higher percentage of the E-isomers when Y = CO(2)Me and the Z-isomers when Y = CN.

Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up.

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs.

The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

Two ZnCcP's bind the same yCc (porphyrin-to-porphyrin separations of 19 and 29 A), with one ZnCcP interacting through the same interface found in the H(2)O crystals. The triplet excited-state of at least one of the two unique ZnCcP's is quenched by electron transfer (ET) to Fe(III)yCc (k(e) = 220 s(-1)). Measurement of thermal recombination ET between Fe(II)yCc and ZnCcP+ in the D(2)O-treated crystals has both slow and fast components that differ by 2 orders of magnitude (k(eb)(1) = 2200 s(-1), k(eb)(2) = 30 s(-1)). Back ET in H(2)O-grown crystals is too fast for observation, but soaking H(2)O-grown crystals in D(2)O for hours generates slower back ET, with kinetics similar to those of the D(2)O-grown crystals (k(eb)(1) = 7000 s(-1), k(eb)(2) = 100 s(-1)). Protein-film voltammetry of yCc adsorbed to mixed alkanethiol monolayers on gold electrodes shows slower ET for D(2)O-grown yCc films than for H(2)O-grown films (k(H) = 800 s(-1); k(D) = 540 s(-1) at 20 degrees C). Soaking H(2)O- or D(2)O-grown films in the counter solvent produces an immediate inverse isotope effect that diminishes over hours until the ET rate reaches that found in the counter solvent. Thus, D(2)O substitution perturbs interactions and ET between yCc and either CcP or electrode films. The effects derive from slow exchanging protons or solvent molecules that in the crystal produce only small structural changes.",

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

The combined results demonstrate that the [Co(4)O(4)](4+) core is capable of acting as a Brønsted base, undergoing either one or two protonation reactions.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

Chloride is bound slowly within the heme a(3)-Cu(B) binuclear center of oxidized enzyme in a manner similar to the binding of azide.

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer. This study highlights the rich mechanistic possibilities for metal mediated decarboxylation reactions involving ambidentate carboxylate ligands.",

Ab initio calculations are presented for CCN+ and CNC+; a saddle point for the reaction CCN+ --&gt; CNC+ is calculated to be 195 kJ mol-1 above the CNC+.  The results provide evidence that the more reactive CCN+ isomer is unlikely to be present in measurable densities in interstellar clouds.",

The results clearly indicate that the acidities of C-H and N-H groups in Cu(+/2+)-adenine are significantly enhanced relative to the neutral adenine.

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

It was shown that CCl3 radicals add oxygen to form CCl3O2 radicals, which eventually yield three chloride ions and CO2. A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations.

The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%. OSN can be a useful tool in facilitating the application of CCC to pharmaceutical process streams.",

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution.

Cl atom rate coefficients for reaction with n-CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]CH(CH2)3CN and n-CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]CH(CH2)4CN were determined as (2.95 ± 0.58) × 10-10 and (3.73 ± 0.60) × 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, respectively. CCl3COCl requires UV-C irradiation, so not all molecules are feasible for use in e.g. relative rate studies.

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

A distinctive EPR spectrum with g = 2.08 is consistent with each W(2) carboxylate being a mixed-valent W(II)-W(III) species. The reaction of W(2)(OOCCF(3))(4) with (CO)(9)Co(3)CCOOH in THF in the absence of Na[OOCCF(3)] leads to the expected diamagnetic W(II)-W(II) cluster carboxylate W(2){OOCCCo(3)(CO)(9)}(3)(OOCCF(3))(THF)(2), 3.",

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms. The k pathway involves attack by CN(-) at the copper site followed by dissociation of the thiolate. The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Synthesis, Structure, and Characterization of the Tungsten(II)-Tungsten(III) Cluster Carboxylate {[Na][W(2){OOCCCo(3)(CO)(9)}(2)(OOCCF(3))(4)(THF)(2)]}(2).\nThe reaction of W(2)(OOCCF(3))(4) with (CO)(9)Co(3)CCOOH and Na[OOCCF(3)] in a nonpolar solvent mixture leads to the formation of the cluster of clusters {[Na][W(2){OOCCCo(3)(CO)(9)}(2)(OOCCF(3))(4)(THF)(2)]}(2), 1, in 40% yield. The structure of 1.3C(6)H(5)CH(3) in the solid state corresponds to a dimer of W(2) dinuclear complexes (monoclinic P2(1)/c, a = 15.234(6) Å, b = 23.326(11) Å, c = 20.658(7) Å, beta = 102.46(3) degrees; V = 7,168(5) Å(3); Z = 4; R(F)() = 8.39%). Each W(2) unit is bridged by two cis cluster carboxylates, and the remaining four equatorial sites are occupied by monodentate [OOCCF(3)](-) ligands. The axial positions contain coordinated THF. The W(2) carboxylate is opened up (W-W distance of 2.449(2) Å) so that the free ends of the [OOCCF(3)](-) ligands on both W(2) carboxylate units can cooperate in chelating two Na(+) ions thereby forming a dimer of W(2) complexes. A distinctive EPR spectrum with g = 2.08 is consistent with each W(2) carboxylate being a mixed-valent W(II)-W(III) species. The reaction of W(2)(OOCCF(3))(4) with (CO)(9)Co(3)CCOOH in THF in the absence of Na[OOCCF(3)] leads to the expected diamagnetic W(II)-W(II) cluster carboxylate W(2){OOCCCo(3)(CO)(9)}(3)(OOCCF(3))(THF)(2), 3.",

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-).

However, the involvement of CAFs in oral cancer (OC) has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

The OGG1 glycosylase function depletion has been seen to obstruct pathological conditions such as inflammation, A3 T-cell lymphoblastic acute leukemia growth, and neurodegenerative diseases, thus warranting OGG1 as an attractive anti-cancer enzyme. Herein, we employed several drug libraries intending to screen non-toxic inhibitory molecules against the active pocket of the enzyme that achieved stable binding mode in dynamics. Two anti-cancer compounds ([O-]C1=C(CC2=CC=CC=C2)SC(=[N+]1CC(=O)NC3=NC=C(CC4=CC=CC=C4)S3)S and CCCN(CCC)[S]-(=O)(=O)C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)NNC2=NC3=CC=C(Br)C=C3C(=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4) from Selleckchem.com were identified to occupy the active pocket of OGG1 and bind with greater affinity than <bControl</b TH5487. The binding affinity of <bTop-1</b is -11.6 kcal/mol while that of <bTop-2</b is -10.7 kcal/mol in contrast to TH5487 <bControl</b (-9 kcal/mol). During molecular dynamic simulations versus time, the said compounds are tightly held by the enzyme with no minor structural deviations reported except flexible loops in particular those present at the N and C-terminal. Both the compounds produced extensive hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme along with stable hydrogen bonding. The docking and molecular dynamics simulations predictions were further validated by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) and Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), and WaterSwap binding energies that validated strong binding of the compounds to the enzyme. The MM/GBSA binding free energy for <bTop-1</b complex is -28.10 kcal/mol, <bTop-2</b complex is -50.14 kcal/mol) and <bControl</b is -46.91 kcal/mol while MM/PBSA value for <bTop-1</b, <bTop-2</b and <bControl</b is -23.38 kcal/mol, -35.29 kcal/mol and -38.20 kcal/mol, respectively. Computational pharmacokinetics support good druglike candidacy of the compounds with acceptable profile of pharmacokinetics and very little toxicity.

Of the various ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium triflate ([bmim][OTf]) in the presence of Cs(2)CO(3), gave the highest radiochemical yields. This method is rapid and particularly convenient because [(18)F]fluoride in H(2)O can be added directly to the reaction media, obviating the careful drying that is typically required for currently used radiofluorination methods. As a model reaction, [(18)F]fluorination of 2-(3-methanesulfonyloxypropoxy)naphthalene was found to provide the corresponding [(18)F]fluoro product in 93+/-1.2% (n=3) radiochemical yield, after reaction at 120 (o)C for 5-10 min under optimized conditions.

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms.

Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver.

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The intermediate subsequently decomposes to eventually yield a mixture of cystine, higher oxides of Cys, and other uncharacterized species. Spectral titrations, transitory (1)H NMR and UV-vis spectra, and the reaction properties of the intermediate are consistent with a formulation of N,N'-dichlorocystine {NDC = [-SCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)](2)}. The reaction of equimolar amounts of HOCl with cystine at pH 11.3 does not yield N-chlorocystine [NCC = (-O2C)(H3N+)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)] but rather a 1:1 mixture of NDC and cystine. This result could be explained by two mechanisms: rapid disproportionation of NCC to produce NDC and cystine or a faster reaction of the second equivalent of HOCl with NCC than the first equivalent of HOCl reacts with cystine. The latter mechanism is favored because of our observation by NMR spectroscopy that NDC decomposes via a species that we have assigned as NCC. Thus, disproportionation of NCC is apparently a relatively slow process. The rates of reaction of cystine(0) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](2) degrees , cystine(1-) = [((-)O(2)C)(H(2)N)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](-), and cystine(2-) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH2)(CO2)(-))]2(2-) have been investigated, and it is clear that cystine(0) is unreactive, whereas cystine(2-) is about four times more reactive than cystine(1-). Accordingly, the following mechanism is proposed (constants for 5 degrees C): HOCl = H+ + OCl-, pK1 = 7.47; cystine(0) = cystine(1-) + H+, pK2 = 8.15; cystine(1-) = cystine(2-) + H+, pK3 = 9.00; cystine(1-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(1-) + H2O, k4 = 4.3(2) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1); cystine(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(2)(-) + H2O, k5 = 1.6(2) x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1); NCC(1-) --&gt; NCC(2-) + H+, k6 = fast; NCC(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NDC(2-) + H2O, k7 = fast. At physiologic pH, the k4 pathway dominates. The generation of long-lived chloramine derivatives of cystine may have physiological consequences, since such compounds are known to react with nucleophiles via mechanisms that are also characteristic of HOCl, electrophilic transfer C+.",

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S). This (3)Π state and its bent components cross at medium RXC (RXN) distances the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of XCN(-) or XNC(-), and at shorter distances the X(2)Π state of the neutral XCN or XNC where the extra electron can detach.

The unimolecular gas-phase reactivity of these species has been investigated by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with a quadrupole-time-of-flight configuration. Distinctive fragmentation pathways have been observed for the free and encapsulated [M(en)(2)](2+) (M = Ni, Cu) dications under collision-induced dissociation (CID) conditions. The dications [M(en)(2)](2+) (M = Ni, Cu) dissociate according to several competitive pathways that involve intra-complex hydrogen or electron-transfer processes. Most of these channels are suppressed after encapsulation inside the cucurbit[8]uril macrocycle and, as a consequence, a simplification of the {[M(en)(2)]@cuc[8]}(2+) fragmentation pattern is observed. The results obtained demonstrate that the encapsulation of a coordination complex inside a host molecule can be used to alter the nature of the product ions generated under CID conditions.",

The E* energy is broken down into three components: energy needed to overcome triplet repulsion between the terminal Xs, energy needed to bring the H-X bonds to their transition state distances, and energy gain by the resonance stabilization of delocalization of the odd electron over three atoms. The strength of the X-H bond is a minor factor. The conclusion that triplet repulsion is a major factor is supported by the London equation and by results of recent high level theoretical calculations. The E* model requires inputs of bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and infrared stretching frequencies of X-H and X-X. Some reported failures of E* are shown to have been caused by use of input values subsequently found to be incorrect.",

This is to verify the possibility of using Cu-based catalyst for NO dissociation which is the rate limiting step for the NO(x) reduction process. The dissociation of molecularly adsorbed NO on the surface is activated for both cases. However, from the reaction path of the NO-Cu(2)O(111) system, the calculated transition state lies below the reference energy which indicates the possibility of dissociation. For the NO-Cu(111) system, the reaction path shows that NO desorption is more likely to occur. The geometric and electronic structure of the Cu(2)O(111) surface indicates that the surface Cu atoms stabilize themselves with reference to the O atom in the subsurface. The interaction results in modification of the electronic structure of the surface Cu atoms of Cu(2)O(111) which greatly affects the adsorption and dissociation of NO. This phenomenon further explains the obtained differences in the dissociation pathways of NO on the surfaces.",

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms. The k pathway involves attack by CN(-) at the copper site followed by dissociation of the thiolate. The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

At room temperature, KX (X = Br and I) and CsX (X = Cl, Br, and I) produce the addition products K[Cu(2)(CN)(2)Br].H(2)O (I), K(3)[Cu(6)(CN)(6)I(3)].2H(2)O (II), Cs[Cu(3)(CN)(3)Cl] (III), Cs[Cu(3)(CN)(3)Br] (IV), and Cs(2)[Cu(4)(CN)(4)I(2)].H(2)O (V), with 3-D frameworks in which the -(CuCN)- chains present in CuCN persist. No reaction occurs, however, with NaX (X = Cl, Br, I) or KCl. The addition compounds, I-V, reconvert to CuCN when washed. Both low- and high-temperature polymorphs of CuCN (LT- and HT-CuCN) are produced, except in the case of Cs[Cu(3)(CN)(3)Cl] (III), which converts only to LT-CuCN. Heating similar AX-CuCN reaction mixtures under hydrothermal conditions at 453 K for 1 day produces single crystals of I-V suitable for structure determination. Under these more forcing conditions, reactions also occur with NaX (X = Cl, Br, I) and KCl. NaBr and KCl cause some conversion of LT-CuCN into HT-CuCN, while NaCl and NaI, respectively, react to form the mixed-valence Cu(I)/Cu(II) compounds [Cu(II)(OH(2))(4)][Cu(I)(4)(CN)(6)], a known phase, and [Cu(II)(OH(2))(4)][Cu(I)(4)(CN)(4)I(2)] (VI), a 3-D framework, which contains infinite -(CuCN)- chains. After 3 days of heating under hydrothermal conditions, the reaction between KI and CuCN produces [Cu(II)(OH(2))(4)][Cu(I)(2)(CN)I(2)](2) (VII), in which the CuCN chains are broken into single Cu-CN-Cu units, which in turn are linked into chains via iodine atoms and then into layers via long Cu-C and Cu-Cu interactions.",

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

The approach uses organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) to improve the application of counter-current chromatography (CCC) in an industrial process. OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%. OSN can be a useful tool in facilitating the application of CCC to pharmaceutical process streams.",

The intermediate subsequently decomposes to eventually yield a mixture of cystine, higher oxides of Cys, and other uncharacterized species. Spectral titrations, transitory (1)H NMR and UV-vis spectra, and the reaction properties of the intermediate are consistent with a formulation of N,N'-dichlorocystine {NDC = [-SCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)](2)}. The reaction of equimolar amounts of HOCl with cystine at pH 11.3 does not yield N-chlorocystine [NCC = (-O2C)(H3N+)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)] but rather a 1:1 mixture of NDC and cystine. This result could be explained by two mechanisms: rapid disproportionation of NCC to produce NDC and cystine or a faster reaction of the second equivalent of HOCl with NCC than the first equivalent of HOCl reacts with cystine. The latter mechanism is favored because of our observation by NMR spectroscopy that NDC decomposes via a species that we have assigned as NCC. Thus, disproportionation of NCC is apparently a relatively slow process. The rates of reaction of cystine(0) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](2) degrees , cystine(1-) = [((-)O(2)C)(H(2)N)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](-), and cystine(2-) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH2)(CO2)(-))]2(2-) have been investigated, and it is clear that cystine(0) is unreactive, whereas cystine(2-) is about four times more reactive than cystine(1-). Accordingly, the following mechanism is proposed (constants for 5 degrees C): HOCl = H+ + OCl-, pK1 = 7.47; cystine(0) = cystine(1-) + H+, pK2 = 8.15; cystine(1-) = cystine(2-) + H+, pK3 = 9.00; cystine(1-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(1-) + H2O, k4 = 4.3(2) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1); cystine(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(2)(-) + H2O, k5 = 1.6(2) x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1); NCC(1-) --&gt; NCC(2-) + H+, k6 = fast; NCC(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NDC(2-) + H2O, k7 = fast. At physiologic pH, the k4 pathway dominates. The generation of long-lived chloramine derivatives of cystine may have physiological consequences, since such compounds are known to react with nucleophiles via mechanisms that are also characteristic of HOCl, electrophilic transfer C+.",

The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%. OSN can be a useful tool in facilitating the application of CCC to pharmaceutical process streams.",

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions.

Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms.

Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy.

The majority of these complexes undergo clean C-O bond-forming reductive elimination, and the mechanism of this process has been investigated. A variety of experiments, including Hammett plots, Eyring analysis, crossover studies, and investigations of the influence of solvent and additives, suggest that C-O bond-forming reductive elimination proceeds via initial carboxylate dissociation followed by C-O coupling from a 5-coordinate cationic Pd(IV) intermediate. The mechanism of competing C-C bond-forming reductive elimination from these complexes has also been investigated and is proposed to involve direct reductive elimination from the octahedral Pd(IV) centers.",

Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution.

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms.

Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

O-[methyl-C]vanillate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzoate) was used as the labeled C(1) substrate. The data showed that for every O-methyl carbon converted to [C]acetate, two were oxidized to CO(2).

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)).

Reaction of the 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* with 1,2-benzene dithiol [1,2-C(6)H(4)(SH)(2)] yields the initial product (o-HS)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp and 1 mol of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*. Addition of 1 equiv more of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp to this solution also results in the formation of 1 equiv of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*, as well as the dimeric product (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-S)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2). This reaction also occurs more rapidly under Ar than under CO, consistent with intramolecular coordination of the second thiol group prior to oxidative addition. The crystal structures of [[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2) and [[eta(2)-o-(mu-S)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2) are reported.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The composition of CuCl2·2H2O in several coordinating solvents and the influence of basic coreagents such as NaO(t)Bu and K2CO3 on the structure in the solid state as well as in solution were investigated. Several experiments involving crystal structure determination, IR spectroscopy, and ultra-high-resolution cryospray-ionization mass spectrometry were performed.

Formal β-H elimination from this species produced a nickel aryl hydride which can undergo reductive elimination in the presence of formaldehyde to generate a carbon monoxide adduct of Ni(0). The reported complexes map out a plausible mechanism of aryl ether hydrogenolysis catalyzed by nickel. Investigations of a previously reported catalytic system using isotopically labeled substrates are consistent with the mechanism proposed in the stoichiometric system, involving β-H elimination from a nickel alkoxide rather than cleavage of the Ni-O bond by H(2).",

Two types of carbonyl stretching vibration bands for 6MC are found with the change of the mole fraction of the aprotic solvent CCl4(X CCl4 in binary solvent mixtures. The dependencies of the frequencies of carbonyl stretching vibrations upsilon(C=O) on X CCl4 allow a distinction and assignment of all species resulting from the solvent-solute interactions.

The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up.

The majority of these complexes undergo clean C-O bond-forming reductive elimination, and the mechanism of this process has been investigated. A variety of experiments, including Hammett plots, Eyring analysis, crossover studies, and investigations of the influence of solvent and additives, suggest that C-O bond-forming reductive elimination proceeds via initial carboxylate dissociation followed by C-O coupling from a 5-coordinate cationic Pd(IV) intermediate. The mechanism of competing C-C bond-forming reductive elimination from these complexes has also been investigated and is proposed to involve direct reductive elimination from the octahedral Pd(IV) centers.",

However, their role in cancer progression remains controversial. We here report that NFATc3 is the dominant isoform of NFAT in human oral epithelial cells, and its expression was increased in a stepwise manner during the progression of oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). More importantly, NFATc3 was highly enriched in self-renewing cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) of OSCC. Increased expression of NFATc3 was required for the maintenance of CSC self-renewal, as NFATc3 inhibition suppressed tumor sphere formation in OSCC cells. Conversely, ectopic NFATc3 expression in non-tumorigenic immortalized oral epithelial cells resulted in the acquisition of self-renewal and increase in CSC phenotype, such as enhanced ALDH1<supHIGH</sup cell population, mobility and drug resistance, indicating the functional role of NFATc3 in the maintenance of CSC phenotype. NFATc3 expression also converted the non-tumorigenic oral epithelial cells to malignant phenotypes. Mechanistic investigations further reveal that NFATc3 binds to the promoter of <iOCT4</i, a stemness transcription factor, for its activation, thereby promoting CSC phenotype. Moreover, suppression of <iOCT4</i abrogated CSC phenotype in the cell with ectopic NFATc3 overexpression and OSCC, and ectopic OCT4 expression sufficiently induced CSC phenotype. Our study indicates that NFATc3 plays an important role in the maintenance of cancer stemness and OSCC progression via novel NFATc3-OCT4 axis, suggesting that this axis may be a potential therapeutic target for OSCC CSCs.",

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms.

The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up.

The complete reaction consists of an associative binding of one H(2)O from the second coordination sphere leading to a six-coordinate intermediate [Zn(H(2)O)(5)(L)](2+)·H(2)O, followed by the dissociation of a water molecule to reach the product state [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O. For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place.

However, the involvement of CAFs in oral cancer (OC) has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

State-specific product channels and overall bimolecular rate constants for depletion of the two Cu+ states are determined using electronic state chromatography. Cu+(1S) participates exclusively in association with all four neutrals, whereas Cl abstraction is the dominant product channel for Cu+(3D). The resulting CuCl+ product subsequently abstracts Cl- in a secondary process. Tertiary reactions are also observed, which include both hydride abstraction (with CH3Cl) and fluoride abstraction (with the fluorinated neutrals). All product channels can be understood in terms of the known thermochemical and quantum mechanical (i.e., spin) requirements. Cu+(1S) is depleted by all four neutrals at 30% to 40% of the ADO rate under these conditions, whereas Cu+(3D) is observed to react at approximately 80% of the ADO rate with CH3Cl, CH2ClF, and CHClF2. Reaction of excited state Cu+ with CClF3 occurs at only 7% of the ADO rate.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration.

For each of these interactions the potential-energy surfaces which correlate with the triplet ground state and the first excited singlet state of the free fragments were investigated for representative states evolving from different approaching modes of the reactants. For all the fluorinated fragments activation of the C-H and C-F bonds by the metal is strongly determined by the low-multiplicity channels arising from the first excited asymptote. Although stable products are predicted for insertion of the metallic atom into both the C-H and the C-F bonds of the different fluorocarbon compounds, comparison between the calculated energy barriers for reactions taking place in the same fluorinated molecule suggests in all cases a kinetic preference for the C-H bond oxidative addition to the platinum atom.",

The reaction of 1 and 2 with hexafluorobenzene (C(6)F(6)) affords the silicon(IV) fluorides, L(1)SiF(C(6)F(5)) (3) and L(2)SiFCl(C(6)F(5)) (4), respectively. The reaction proceeds through the unprecedented oxidative addition of one of the C-F bonds to the silicon(II) center without any additional catalyst. When 1 and 2 are treated with octafluorotoluene (C(6)F(5)CF(3)), pentafluoropyridine (C(5)F(5)N) regioselective C-F bond activation occurs leading to the formation of L(1)SiF(4-C(6)F(4)CF(3)) (5), L(1)SiF(4-C(5)F(4)N) (6), L(2)SiFCl(4-C(6)F(4)CF(3)) (7), and L(2)SiFCl(4-C(5)F(4)N) (8), respectively. More interestingly, compounds 1 and 2 react with pentafluorobenzene (C(6)F(5)H) under formation of silicon(IV) hydride L(1)SiH(C(6)F(5)) (9) by chemoselective C-H bond activation, in the latter case producing silicon(IV) fluoride L(2)SiFCl(4-C(6)F(4)H) (10) by chemo- as well as regioselective C-F bond activation. Furthermore, the reaction of 1 with 1,3,5-trifluorobenzene (1,3,5-C(6)F(3)H(3)) leads to the chemoselective formation of silicon(IV) hydride L(1)SiH(1,3,5-C(6)F(3)H(2)) (11). The formation of compounds 9 and 11 occurs via oxidative addition of the aromatic C-H bond to the silicon(II) center instead of C-F bond activation. All reported reactions proceed without any additional catalyst.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The dysprosium analogue (2) of 1 and 3 was previously reported by us. The heptanuclear monocationic clusters in 1 and 3 were formed by placement of seven metal ions (4 Co and 3 Ln) in a vertex shared dicubane structure from the control of two Schiff base anions and crystallized in the presence of in situ generated and literature unknown counter anions Tb(η1-O2CCMe3)2(η2-O2CCMe3)2(MeOH)2- and Ho(η1-O2CCMe3)2(η2-O2CCMe3)2(MeOH)2-. Interesting solvent-induced cluster structure transformation was observed on dissolving the heptanuclear aggregates in MeCN for the formation of decanuclear clusters 4-6. These high nuclearity clusters consist of a vertex shared heptanuclear dicubane part and a curved trinuclear chain linking the two cubic halves. The dicubane unit differs from that of the heptanuclear precursors in the presence of CoII/III at the shared vertex as opposed to LnIII and the absence of OMe- bridges. HRMS (+ve) analysis shed light on the pathway of formation of these heptanuclear molecules, while at the same time revealing a different aggregation process for the decanuclear clusters.",

The experimental first vertical ionization potential for CH(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), and CCl(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2) was determined to be 10.91, 11.42, and 11.07 eV, respectively. In this study, the rule of the conformation properties of anhydride XC(O)OC(O)Y was improved by analyzing the different conformations of anhydrides with various substitutes.",

The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

Photolysis of 1 with vinyltrimethylsilane ultimately yields three isomeric products of [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(CH2=CHSiMe3)2]2, 3a, 3b and 3c which are differentiated by the relative orientations of the vinylsilane. When this reaction is undertaken in d6-benzene, H/D exchange between the solvent and the alpha-proton of the vinylsilane is revealed. In addition evidence for two isomers of the solvent complex [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(eta2-toluene)] was obtained in these and related experiments when the photolysis was completed at low temperature without substrate, although no evidence for H/D exchange was observed.

This reaction is further complicated by the formation of two Si-C bond activation products, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][RhH(mu-SiEt2)]2 5 and [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][(RhEt)(RhH)(mu-SiEt2)2] 6. Complex 5 was also produced when 1 was photolysed with Et2SiH2. When the photochemical reactions with Et3SiH were repeated at low temperatures, two isomers of the unstable C-H activation products, the vinyl hydrides [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][{Rh(SiEt3)H}{Rh(SiEt3)}(mu-eta1,eta2-CH=CH2)] 7a and 7b, were obtained. Thermally, 4c was shown to form the ring substituted silyl migration products [(eta5-C5H4)CH2(C5H3SiEt3)][Rh(SiEt3)2(H)2]2 8 while 4b formed [CH2(C5H3SiEt3)2][Rh(SiEt3)2(H)2]2 (9a and 9b) upon reaction with excess silane. The corresponding photochemical reaction with Me3SiH yielded the expected products [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiMe3)H] 10a, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiMe3)H]2 10b, [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(C2H4)(SiMe3)H][Rh(SiMe3)2(H)2] 10c and [CH2(eta5-C5H4)2][Rh(SiMe3)2(H)2]2 10d.

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates.

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms.

Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver.

Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

Various carboxylic acids can be incorporated into OCP, and these types of carboxylic acid are presented with reference to the latest research results. The incorporation of carboxylate ions into OCP represents a modification of the OCP crystal at the molecular level and can impart various functions.

Addition of a second equivalent of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* to this solution results in the formation of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* as well as (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2).

For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place. For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed. The gas-phase proton affinity of L shows instructive correlations with structural parameters and energy gaps for the investigated reactions.",

In this report, a combined experimental and computational study is presented, which provides mechanistic understanding of the unprecedented oxidative coupling of NHCs at Cu. The presence of Cu(I) -, Cu(II) -, and Cu(III) -NHC complexes during the process is postulated, with the unusual Ccarbene -Ccarbene oxidative coupling reaction occurring under extremely mild reaction conditions.

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer.

This suggests that the bond connectivities of anion, neutral and cation C(3)O are the same. Copyright 1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

Other chelating agents assayed, including o-phenanthroline, cannot replace NC in promoting the O2 formation. O2 is also produced by adding NC to a mixture of Cu(II) and H2O2. Concomitant with the O2 evolution, the typical absorbance of the (NC)2Cu(I) complex appears to account for the complete reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). It is concluded that the addition of H2O2 with Cu(II) produces the equilibrium Cu(II)(O2H)(-)&lt;--&gt; Cu(I.)O2H. Addition of NC shifts the equilibrium to the right side by binding Cu(I). The released O2.- then reacts with the remaining Cu(II) yielding, in the presence of NC, the net reaction of 4 NC + 2 Cu(II) + H2O2 --&gt; 2 (NC)2Cu(I) + O2 + 2 H+. O2 is also released in the absence of added NC provided the H2O2 concentration is increased. In these conditions the Cu(II)(O2H) complex undergoes other reactions leading to the copper-catalysed decomposition of H2O2.",

At lower temperatures, evidence for a transient metallo-enol ester species Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(OC{Me}O-C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) was obtained. A comprehensive theoretical study to probe the nature of the alkyne/vinylidene tautomerisation has been undertaken using Density Functional Theory. Calculations based on a number of isomers of the model system Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHMe)(PH(3))(2) demonstrate that both the η(2)(CC) alkyne complex Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(η(2)-HC≡CMe)(PH(3))(2) and the C-H agostic σ-complex Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(η(2){CH}-HC≡CMe)(PH(3))(2) are minima on the potential energy surface. The lowest energy pathway for the formation of the vinylidene complex involves the intramolecular deprotonation of the σ-complex by an acetate ligand followed by reprotonation of the subsequently formed alkynyl ligand. This process is thus termed a Ligand-Assisted Proton Shuttle (LAPS). Calculations performed on the full experimental system Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) reinforce the notion that lowest energy pathway involves the deprotonation/reprotonation of the alkyne by an acetate ligand.

A joint experimental and theoretical study (energies calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) suggests that the neutral radical CCC(O)Ph rearranges via a four-centred ipso radical cyclisation/ring opening to form the isomer PhCCCO in an exothermic reaction. (13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2.

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-).

Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

The corresponding reaction for O + SCSe gives OCS and OCSe as observable products, with their yields given as 32.2 +/- 4.5 and 30.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively. Computational studies using UB3LYP/aug-cc-PVTZ methods have been used particularly to determine the reaction pathways for the channels in which OCS or OCSe is produced.",

In this study, strain TH-001, an O-demethylating obligate anaerobe, was chosen to represent this physiological group, and the carbon flow when cells were grown on O-methyl substituents as a C(1) substrate was determined by C radiotracer techniques. O-[methyl-C]vanillate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzoate) was used as the labeled C(1) substrate. The data showed that for every O-methyl carbon converted to [C]acetate, two were oxidized to CO(2). Quantitation of the carbon recovered in the two products, acetate and CO(2), indicated that acetate was formed in part by the fixation of unlabeled CO(2). The specific activity of C in acetate was 70% of that in the O-methyl substrate, suggesting that only one carbon of acetate was derived from the O-methyl group.

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer.

Thirty-eight percent (18/48) of the OCSCCs exhibited a mutation in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. There was a significantly higher incidence of p53 mutations in OCSCCs from tobacco users (predominantly cigarette smokers) compared to those who had never used tobacco.

No specific pattern of mutation was observed in OCSCCs from those subjects who had never used tobacco.

These reactions are rare examples of C(sp(3))-H activation without a covalent directing group, which-even more unusually-occur α to a carbonyl group. For the reaction of the α-imidazolium ester [3H]Cl, the site selectivity of C-H activation could be controlled by the choice of metal and ligand: with [Cp*IrCl2]2 and NaOAc, C(sp(3))-H activation gave the N-ylide complex 4; in contrast, with Ag2O followed by [Cp*IrCl2]2, C(sp(2))-H activation gave the N-heterocyclic carbene complex 5. DFT calculations revealed that the N-ylide complex 4 was the kinetic product of an ambiphilic C-H activation.

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

With the aim of discriminating the different CDCl3 dissociation mechanisms, the IRMPD of CDCl3 in the presence of NO2 was first studied. In order to make evident the CDCl3 dissociation produced by the catalytic cycle, we then studied the IRMPD of CDCl3 in mixtures with CHCl3 with O2 as the acceptor gas.

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms.

Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy.

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

The Fermi-contact (FC) term probes the first-order density at the positions of the coupling nuclei, whereas the noncontact terms (the paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO) and the spin-dipole (SD) terms) probe the pi character of the C-C bond (the diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO) term can mostly be neglected). A model is tested, in which the value of the FC(CC) term is estimated with the help of measured SSCCs 1J(CH). The difference between the measured J(CC) and the estimated FC(CC) values, delta(CC) = PSO(CC) + SD(CC) + DSO(CC), provides a semiquantitative measure of the pi character of a C-C multiple bond. The applicability and limitations of this approach are discussed by partitioning the four Ramsey terms of the SSCC 1J(CC) into one- and two-orbital contributions. The FC, PSO, and SD terms of 1J(CC) are explained and analyzed with regard to their relationship to other C-C bond properties.

The thermodynamic results demonstrate that the hydrolysis of OCS by nucleophilic water and hydroxide ion should proceed more favorably at low temperature. The hydrolysis of OCS by the hydroxide ion is the main reaction channel from thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, and the bulk solvent can influence the rate-determining step in this channel. However, the solvent barely modifies the activation energy of the rate-determining step. For the hydrolysis of OCS by nucleophilic water, the solvent does not modify the rate-determining step, and the corresponding activation energy of the rate-determining step barely changes.

The approach uses organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) to improve the application of counter-current chromatography (CCC) in an industrial process. OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%. OSN can be a useful tool in facilitating the application of CCC to pharmaceutical process streams.",

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms. The k pathway involves attack by CN(-) at the copper site followed by dissociation of the thiolate. The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

An experimental study has demonstrated that this reaction occurs under very mild conditions, with significant conversion being observed at 255 K. At lower temperatures, evidence for a transient metallo-enol ester species Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(OC{Me}O-C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) was obtained. A comprehensive theoretical study to probe the nature of the alkyne/vinylidene tautomerisation has been undertaken using Density Functional Theory. Calculations based on a number of isomers of the model system Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHMe)(PH(3))(2) demonstrate that both the η(2)(CC) alkyne complex Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(η(2)-HC≡CMe)(PH(3))(2) and the C-H agostic σ-complex Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(η(2){CH}-HC≡CMe)(PH(3))(2) are minima on the potential energy surface. The lowest energy pathway for the formation of the vinylidene complex involves the intramolecular deprotonation of the σ-complex by an acetate ligand followed by reprotonation of the subsequently formed alkynyl ligand. This process is thus termed a Ligand-Assisted Proton Shuttle (LAPS). Calculations performed on the full experimental system Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) reinforce the notion that lowest energy pathway involves the deprotonation/reprotonation of the alkyne by an acetate ligand. Inclusion of the full ligand substituents in the calculations are necessary to reproduce the experimental observation of Ru(κ(1)-OAc)(κ(2)-OAc)(=C=CHPh)(PPh(3))(2) as the thermodynamic product.",

The branching ratio for the reaction channel forming CH(3)C(O)O, OH and O(2) (reaction ) has been determined from experiments in which OH radicals were scavenged by addition of benzene to the system, with subsequent formation of phenol used as the primary diagnostic for OH radical formation. The dependence of the phenol yield on benzene concentration was found to be consistent with its formation from the OH-initiated oxidation of benzene, thereby confirming the presence of OH radicals in the system. The dependence of the phenol yield on the initial peroxy radical precursor reagent concentration ratio, [CH(3)OH](0)/[CH(3)CHO](0), is consistent with OH formation resulting mainly from the reaction of CH(3)C(O)O(2) with HO(2) in the early stages of the experiments, such that the limiting yield of phenol at high benzene concentrations is well-correlated with that of CH(3)C(O)OOH, a well-established product of the CH(3)C(O)O(2) + HO(2) reaction (via channel (3a)). However, a delayed source of phenol was also identified, which is attributed mainly to an analogous OH-forming channel of the reaction of HO(2) with HOCH(2)O(2) (reaction ), formed from the reaction of HO(2) with product HCHO. This was investigated in additional series of experiments in which Cl(2)/CH(3)OH/benzene/air and Cl(2)/HCHO/benzene/air mixtures were photolysed. The various reaction systems were fully characterised by simulations using a detailed chemical mechanism. This allowed the following branching ratios to be determined: CH(3)C(O)O(2) + HO(2)--&gt; CH(3)C(O)OOH + O(2), k(3a)/k(3) = 0.38 +/- 0.13; --&gt; CH(3)C(O)OH + O(3), k(3b)/k(3) = 0.12 +/- 0.04; --&gt; CH(3)C(O)O + OH + O(2), k(3c)/k(3) = 0.43 +/- 0.10: HOCH(2)O(2) + HO(2)--&gt; HCOOH + H(2)O + O(2), k(17b)/k(17) = 0.30 +/- 0.06; --&gt; HOCH(2)O + OH + O(2), k(17c)/k(17) = 0.20 +/- 0.05. The results therefore provide strong evidence for significant participation of the radical-forming channels of these reactions, with the branching ratio for the title reaction being in good agreement with the value reported in one previous study. As part of this work, the kinetics of the reaction of Cl atoms with phenol (reaction (14)) have also been investigated. The rate coefficient was determined relative to the rate coefficient for the reaction of Cl with CH(3)OH, during the photolysis of mixtures of Cl(2), phenol and CH(3)OH, in either N(2) or air at 296 K and 760 Torr. A value of k(14) = (1.92 +/- 0.17) x 10(-10) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) was determined from the experiments in N(2), in agreement with the literature. In air, the apparent rate coefficient was about a factor of two lower, which is interpreted in terms of regeneration of phenol from the product phenoxy radical, C(6)H(5)O, possibly via its reaction with HO(2).",

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions.

The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

The majority of these complexes undergo clean C-O bond-forming reductive elimination, and the mechanism of this process has been investigated. A variety of experiments, including Hammett plots, Eyring analysis, crossover studies, and investigations of the influence of solvent and additives, suggest that C-O bond-forming reductive elimination proceeds via initial carboxylate dissociation followed by C-O coupling from a 5-coordinate cationic Pd(IV) intermediate. The mechanism of competing C-C bond-forming reductive elimination from these complexes has also been investigated and is proposed to involve direct reductive elimination from the octahedral Pd(IV) centers.",

Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer. This study highlights the rich mechanistic possibilities for metal mediated decarboxylation reactions involving ambidentate carboxylate ligands.",

The role of CAs in tumorigenesis is controversial, especially regarding the expression of CA isoenzymes between various tumor types. This study explores the correlation between the expressions of CA I and CA II and the characteristic features of oral cancer. We immunohistochemically examined the expressions of CA I and CA II in 279 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) using tissue microarrays. Additionally, the oral cancer cell line SCC-9 was used to confirm the relationship between CA I and CA II expression and cell growth. We found a significant correlation between positive CA I and CA II stains and OSCC for more advanced clinical stage (P = 0.014 or 0.012) and larger tumor size (P = 0.008 or 0.038), but not for positive lymph node metastasis, distal metastasis, and recurrence. In vitro analysis also showed that treatment with a CA inhibitor, acetazolamide, inhibited the growth of SCC-9 cells.

Other chelating agents assayed, including o-phenanthroline, cannot replace NC in promoting the O2 formation. O2 is also produced by adding NC to a mixture of Cu(II) and H2O2. Concomitant with the O2 evolution, the typical absorbance of the (NC)2Cu(I) complex appears to account for the complete reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I).

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms.

Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The thermodynamic results demonstrate that the hydrolysis of OCS by nucleophilic water and hydroxide ion should proceed more favorably at low temperature. The hydrolysis of OCS by the hydroxide ion is the main reaction channel from thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, and the bulk solvent can influence the rate-determining step in this channel. However, the solvent barely modifies the activation energy of the rate-determining step. For the hydrolysis of OCS by nucleophilic water, the solvent does not modify the rate-determining step, and the corresponding activation energy of the rate-determining step barely changes.

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

Our calculated relative activation barriers of the SN2 reaction in methanol, tert-butyl alcohol, and CH3CN are in good agreement with experimental observations.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-).

Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

The quadratic force constants and the stretching potentials of Hn CCHn have been calculated at the CASSCF/cc-pVTZ level. The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%. OSN can be a useful tool in facilitating the application of CCC to pharmaceutical process streams.",

With Cp(2)Zr(py)(Me(3)SiC[triple bond]CSiMe(3)) as the zirconocene reagent, the couplings could be carried out at room temperature; however, at higher temperatures significant quantities of the 2,4-fluoroaryl substituted (alpha beta) isomers were also formed. None of the conditions employed produced the 2,5-fluoroaryl substituted (alpha alpha) isomers. These fluoroaryl-substituted zirconacyclopentadienes were readily converted to butadienes via reactions with acids. The zirconacyclopentadiene Cp(2)ZrC(4)-2,5-Ph(2)-3,4-(C(6)F(5))(2), which resulted from the coupling of PhC[triple bond]C(C(6)F(5)), was converted to the corresponding thiophene by reaction with S(2)Cl(2), and to an arene by reaction with MeO(2)CC[triple bond]CCO(2)Me/CuCl. Mechanistic studies on zirconocene couplings of (p-CF(3)C(6)H(4))C[triple bond]C(p-MeC(6)H(4)) indicate that the observed regioselectivities are determined by an electronic factor that controls the orientation of at least one of the two alkynes as they are coupled. Additionally, these studies suggest an unsymmetrical transition state for the zirconocene coupling of alkynes, and this is supported by DFT calculations. The reaction of [(C(6)F(5))C[triple bond]CCH(2)](2)CH(2) with Cp(2)Zr(py)(Me(3)SiC[triple bond]CSiMe(3)) resulted in a zirconacyclopentadiene in which the pentafluorophenyl substituents have been forced into the 2,5-positions (alpha alpha). Zirconocene coupling of the diyne (C(6)F(5))C[triple bond]C-1,4-C(6)H(4)-C[triple bond]C(C(6)F(5)) provided a route to conjugated polymers bearing electron-withdrawing pentafluorophenyl groups.",

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

This paper describes biophysical and structural studies on ruthenium(II) tris(bipyridine) surface mimetics that recognize cytochrome (cyt) c and inhibit the cyt c/cyt c peroxidase (CCP) PPI. Binding is electrostatically driven, with enhanced affinity achieved through enthalpic contributions thought to arise from the ability of the surface mimetics to make a greater number of noncovalent interactions than CCP with surface-exposed basic residues on cyt c. High-field natural abundance <sup1</sup H,<sup15</sup N HSQC NMR experiments are consistent with surface mimetics binding to cyt c in similar manner to CCP. This provides a framework for understanding recognition of proteins by supramolecular receptors and informing the design of ligands superior to the protein partners upon which they are inspired.",

Despite its importance as a drug target, the molecular activation mechanism of CCR5, i.e., how chemokine agonists transduce the activation signal through the receptor, is yet unknown. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of wild-type CCR5 in an active conformation bound to the chemokine super-agonist [6P4]CCL5 and the heterotrimeric G<subi</sub protein. The structure provides the rationale for the sequence-activity relation of agonist and antagonist chemokines. The N terminus of agonist chemokines pushes onto specific structural motifs at the bottom of the orthosteric pocket that activate the canonical GPCR microswitch network. This activation mechanism differs substantially from other CC chemokine receptors that bind chemokines with shorter N termini in a shallow binding mode involving unique sequence signatures and a specialized activation mechanism.",

One-dimensional (1D) NMR experiments with an 18-residue synthetic peptide containing the amino acid sequence of an HIV-1 RT-zinc finger domain (HIV1-F1) indicate that the sequences are capable of binding zinc tightly and stoichiometrically. 1H-113Cd spin echo difference NMR data confirm that the Cys and His amino acids are coordinated to metal in the 113Cd adduct. The 3D structure of the zinc adduct [Zn(HIV1-F1)] was determined to high atomic resolution by a new NMR-based approach that utilizes 2D-NOESY back-calculations as a measure of the consistency between the structures and the experimental data. Several interesting structural features were observed, including (1) the presence of extensive internal hydrogen bonding, and (2) the similarity of the folding of the first six residues to the folding observed by X-ray crystallography for related residues in the iron domain of rubredoxin. Structural constraints associated with conservatively substituted glycines provide further rationale for the physiological relevance of the zinc adduct. Similar NMR and structural results have been obtained for the second HIV-1 RT-zinc finger peptide, Zn(HIV1-F2). NMR studies of the zinc adduct with the NCP isolated directly from HIV-1 particles provide solid evidence that zinc finger domains are formed that are conformationally similar (if not identical) to the peptide structures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In this study we identify sequence dependent characteristics that are conserved in the DNA-binding zinc fingers and are probably required for a functional DNA-binding zinc finger. Examination of the conserved properties in view of the solved three dimensional structure of a zinc finger, confirms the importance of most of these properties. The absence of the identified physical-chemical characteristics from CCHH containing sequences of non-DNA binding proteins suggest that they can be used to distinguish between spurious and actual DNA binding zinc fingers.",

Using NMR spectroscopy, we detail the interaction of CNOT4 with UbcH5B and characterize RING residues that are critical for this interaction. CNOT4 acts as a potent E3 ligase in vitro.

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

The configurational equilibria were determined by direct integration of the resonances of the individual isomers in the (1)H NMR spectra after equilibration of both alpha- and beta-isomers. The equilibrations of the neutral compounds 1-4 in CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), and (CD(3))(2)CO were achieved by HgCl(2) catalysis and those of the neutral compounds 9-11 in CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD by triflic acid catalysis. The equilibrations of the protonated compounds in both the sulfur series (solvents, CD(3)OD, CD(3)NO(2), (CD(3))(2)CO, CDCl(3), and CD(2)Cl(2)) and oxygen series (solvents, CD(2)Cl(2) and CD(3)OD) were achieved with triflic acid. The substituent and solvent effects on the equilibria are discussed in terms of steric and electrostatic effects and orbital interactions associated with the endo-anomeric effect. A generalized reverse anomeric effect does not exist in neutral or protonated N-aryl-5-thioglucopyranosylamines and N-arylglucopyranosylamines. The anomeric effect ranges from 0.85 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 1.54 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. The compounds 1-4 and 9-11 show an enhanced endo-anomeric effect upon protonation, ranging from 1.73 kcal mol(-)(1) in 2 to 2.57 kcal mol(-)(1) in 10. We estimate the increase in the anomeric effect upon protonation of 10 to be approximately 1.0 kcal mol(-)(1). However, this effect is offset by steric effects due to the associated counterion which we estimate to be approximately 1.2 kcal mol(-)(1). The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 1-4 increase in the order OMe &lt; H &lt; CF(3) &lt; NO(2), in agreement with the dominance of steric effects (due to the counterion) over the endo-anomeric effect. The values of K(eq)(axial-equatorial) in protonated 9-11 show the trend OMe &gt; H &lt; NO(2) that is explained by the balance of the endo-anomeric effect and steric effects in the individual compounds. The trends in the values of the C(1)-H(1) coupling constants for 1-4 and the corresponding deacetylated compounds 5-8 as a function of substituent and alpha- or beta-configuration are discussed in terms of the Perlin effect and the interplay of the endo- and exo-anomeric effects.",

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

Mg(2+) bound to OCN to the same extent as Ca(2+) but did not induce the dimerization of OCN. La(3+) bound to a lesser extent than either Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) to OCN and, like Mg(2+), did not influence dimerization. Each Gla residue of OCN participates in Ca(2+) binding, whereas Mg(2+) binding may occur preferentially at sites other than Gla residues.

When a piece of tooth was added to a solution of H(2)O(2) as a catalyst, production of *OH after plasma treatment was 1.9 times greater than when using H(2)O(2) alone.

The structure of 1.3C(6)H(5)CH(3) in the solid state corresponds to a dimer of W(2) dinuclear complexes (monoclinic P2(1)/c, a = 15.234(6) Å, b = 23.326(11) Å, c = 20.658(7) Å, beta = 102.46(3) degrees; V = 7,168(5) Å(3); Z = 4; R(F)() = 8.39%). Each W(2) unit is bridged by two cis cluster carboxylates, and the remaining four equatorial sites are occupied by monodentate [OOCCF(3)](-) ligands. The axial positions contain coordinated THF. The W(2) carboxylate is opened up (W-W distance of 2.449(2) Å) so that the free ends of the [OOCCF(3)](-) ligands on both W(2) carboxylate units can cooperate in chelating two Na(+) ions thereby forming a dimer of W(2) complexes. A distinctive EPR spectrum with g = 2.08 is consistent with each W(2) carboxylate being a mixed-valent W(II)-W(III) species. The reaction of W(2)(OOCCF(3))(4) with (CO)(9)Co(3)CCOOH in THF in the absence of Na[OOCCF(3)] leads to the expected diamagnetic W(II)-W(II) cluster carboxylate W(2){OOCCCo(3)(CO)(9)}(3)(OOCCF(3))(THF)(2), 3.",

Studies with malignant carcinoma CAL27 cells and immortalized GT1 fibroblasts showed that cytotoxicity of the theaflavin mixture was enhanced as the exposure time was increased, with the tumor CAL27 cells more sensitive than the GT1 cells.

Using a de Fonbrune micromanipulator, CCC specimens were isolated from supragingival plaque samples. The viability of one specimen thus obtained was established by observing growth on a slide culture. One set of CCC specimens was transferred to broth and incubated aerobically immediately upon collection. Another set was transferred to prereduced transport medium and later plated on blood agar for aerobic and anaerobic culturing. A total of 10 coccal strains were thus isolated. Antisera produced in rabbits against the 10 strains were used to localize these coccal organisms on plaque smears by using the indirect fluorescent antibody technique. Of the 10 antisera tested, 2 produced against streptococcal strains consistently gave a positive immunofluorescent reaction with the coccal component of CCC in the plaque smears; the corresponding streptococci were therefore considered to be CCC forming strains in vivo.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The majority of these complexes undergo clean C-O bond-forming reductive elimination, and the mechanism of this process has been investigated. A variety of experiments, including Hammett plots, Eyring analysis, crossover studies, and investigations of the influence of solvent and additives, suggest that C-O bond-forming reductive elimination proceeds via initial carboxylate dissociation followed by C-O coupling from a 5-coordinate cationic Pd(IV) intermediate.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

In contrast, minor rearrangement of (CC(13)CO)(+*) is observed [(CC(13)CO)(+*)--&gt;(OCC(13)C)(+*), while significant rearrangement occurs for (CC(13)CS)(+*) [(CC(13)CS)(+*)--&gt;(SCC(13)C)(+*)]. Theoretical calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory show that the cationic rearrangements occur by stepwise processes via key rhombic structures. Overall, the degenerate processes result in O and S migration from C-3 to C-1. The cations (CCCO)(+*) and (CCCS)(+*) require excess energies of &gt; or = 516 and &gt; or = 226 kJ mol(-1) respectively to effect rearrangement.",
