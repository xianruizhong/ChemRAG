Magnesium is an important enzyme cofactor and is essential to several metabolic processes. Further, the mineral helps regulate blood pressure and is necessary for RNA, DNA and protein synthesis among several other functions.   Despite the importance of magnesium and its availability via several food sources, an estimated 56 to 68% of adults who live in developed, western countries do not meet the recommended daily intake (RDI) of magnesium. Several factors and common behaviours reduce the availability of magnesium in the diet such as food processing and cooking vegetables (which are normally a rich source of magnesium).']",

KORs were first associated with itching in 1984. Further investigations revealed that dynorphins, endogenous agonists of KORs, work to inhibit the itching sensation at the spinal cord level, and scratching could be elicited in mouse models with the administration of KOR antagonists. These revelations led to the study of KOR agonists as a potential treatment option in patients suffering from pruritic conditions.  Pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease (also called uremic pruritus) affects 50-60% of all patients on dialysis and 25% of non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. The clinical burden of uremic pruritus in this patient population is being increasingly recognized as contributing to a significant reduction in patient quality of life, poor outcomes, and even mortality. Options for therapy are limited - with no FDA-approved treatments, off-label [gabapentin] was the most evidence-based and widely available treatment.  Difelikefalin received FDA approval in August 2021 (under the brand name Korsuva), becoming the first FDA-approved therapy for patients with chronic kidney disease suffering from uremic pruritus. Difelikefalin was later approved by the EMA in April 2022 for the same indication.']",

Upon ocular administration, aganirsen binds to IRS-1 mRNA and blocks the synthesis of IRS-1. By blocking the expression of IRS-1 in pro-angiogenic conditions, such as those seen in corneal grafts and other inflammatory-based ocular diseases, aganirsen blocks the corneal neovascularization pathway, inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production, which is a key component of neovascularization, and prevents the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, which together decrease the risk of corneal neovascularization. Additionally, upon corneal transplantation, neovascularization induces an immune response that can lead to immunological corneal graft rejection; therefore, by inhibiting neovascularization this agent can decrease the risk of corneal graft rejection. IRS-1, overexpressed in endothelial cells during corneal neovascularization, plays a key role in the regulation of angiogenesis.']",

Upon administration, KA2507 targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of HDAC6. This results in an accumulation of highly acetylated chromatin histones, the induction of chromatin remodeling and an altered pattern of gene expression. Specifically, inhibition of HDAC6 prevents STAT3 activity, which leads to a reduction in programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression. Eventually, this results in a selective transcription of tumor suppressor genes, tumor suppressor protein-mediated inhibition of tumor cell division and an induction of apoptosis in tumor cells that overexpress HDAC6. HDAC6, which is upregulated in many tumor cell types, deacetylates chromatin histone proteins.']",

MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed or mutated in many tumor cell types, plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis, and in tumor angiogenesis. Src, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase upregulated in many tumor cell types, plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation, motility, invasiveness and survival. CSF1R is a cell-surface receptor for colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1); this receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and plays a major role in both immune suppression and the induction of tumor cell proliferation.']",

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.  Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD. Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality. Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack. Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.  While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin\\'s potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as \"good cholesterol\"). Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.']",

Inhibition of EZH2 specifically prevents the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). This decrease in histone methylation alters gene expression patterns associated with cancer pathways and results in decreased proliferation of EZH2-expressing cancer cells. EZH2, an HMT class enzyme and the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation; its expression is correlated with tumor initiation, progression, stem cell self-renewal, migration and angiogenesis.']",

Of these 135 compounds, those that contain chlorine atoms at the 2,3,7,8-positions of the parent dibenzofuran molecule are especially harmful. Other than for laboratory use of small amounts of CDFs for research and development purposes, these chemicals are not deliberately produced by industry. Most CDFs are produced in very small amounts as unwanted impurities of certain products and processes utilizing chlorinated compounds. Only a few of the 135 CDF compounds have been produced in large enough quantities so that their properties, such as color, smell, taste, and toxicity could be studied. (L952)']",

This radiopharmaceutical is prepared by conjugating PRGD2 with chelator S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (BNOTA) which is capable of forming a six-coordinate complex with Ga 68. After intravenous administration, gallium Ga 68-labeled BNOTA-PRGD2 binds to alphaVbeta3 integrin on the cell membrane via the cyclic tri-amino acids RGD motif. Upon PET imaging, alphaVbeta3 integrin-expressing tumor cells can be visualized and expression levels can be quantified. Compared to other radiolabeled RGD-containing peptides, this agent shows increased affinity to alphaVbeta3 integrin, enhanced tumor uptake as well as improved pharmacokinetics. alphaVbeta3 integrin is overexpressed on certain tumor cells and tumor endothelial cells while minimally or not expressed on healthy, normal cells and plays a key role in angiogenesis, tumor proliferation and survival.']",

ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Trandolapril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction, as an adjunct treatment for congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.']",

Inhibition of NEP leads to the inhibition of hydrolyzation of a number of endogenous vasoactive peptides, such as bradykinin and substance P and as NEP is the principal enzyme degrading natriuretic peptides, NEP inhibition also results in an increase in natriuretic peptidase circulation.

Inhibition of EZH2 specifically prevents the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27). This decrease in histone methylation alters gene expression patterns associated with cancer pathways and results in decreased proliferation of EZH2-expressing cancer cells. EZH2, an HMT class enzyme and the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cells and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation; its expression is correlated with tumor initiation, progression, stem cell self-renewal, migration and angiogenesis.']",
