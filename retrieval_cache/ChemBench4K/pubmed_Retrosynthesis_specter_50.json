We apply the tools of the preceding paper to these variable types for select reactions and classes. Along the way, geometric descriptors are formulated which complement the structure graph sequences of chemistry texts and journals. In addition, the statistical structure underpinning carbon transformations is explored more deeply. Overall, this work brings to light several informatic principles of organic reactions. Knowledge of these can assist in synthetic designs on both large- and small-scales.

Two steps encountered by combinatorial scientists appear well suited to ANOVA: the prediction of synthetic outcomes (purity and yield) of set members and the analysis of screening data to identify combinations of reagent inputs that result in molecules with a desired property. To illustrate, a subset of a combinatorial array, referred to as a reaction rehearsal set, is evaluated to create a model predictive of the individual synthetic outcomes of the full matrix. In a second exercise, the biochemical screening data obtained from a combinatorial library is analyzed to identify reagent interactions that result in molecules possessing the sought activity.",

Both manual and automatic devices have been described. Some features that contribute to its popularity include: it produces all possible structural combinations of the monomers, it has outstanding productivity, it leads to the formation of individual compounds in nearly equimolar quantities (affected by statistics and incomplete reactions), and it can be applied to all classes of organic compounds. Since an enormously large number of compounds can be produced in principle in a relatively short time, some practical considerations are discussed that can be useful in library design. Encoding organic libraries by peptide or nucleotide sequences or with binary tags are also described together with methods for tagging macroscopic support units with electronic chips, two dimensional bar codes or colored resin and capsule caps. Among the deconvolution strategies, the iteration method, positional scanning, omission libraries, the Selectide and the Pharmacopeia methods are mentioned.

The index is based on signal detection theory and is free of the response bias that can invalidate difference testing protocols, including categorization and same-different and A-Not A tests. It is also a nonparametric analysis, making no assumptions about sensory distributions, and is simple to compute and understand. The R-Index is also flexible in its application. Methods based on R-Index analysis have been used as detection and sensory difference tests, as simple alternatives to hedonic scaling, and for the measurement of consumer concepts.

The strengths of conventional chemistry lie in the optimization, systematic modification, and improvement of new lead structures.

A comparison of different scales.\nNaturalness is an important heuristic method for examining consumers' evaluation and choice of food. In recent years, several scales have been proposed to measure the importance of naturalness for consumers. These scales vary in the number of items they contain and in the aspects they cover. The aim of our research was to examine how strongly the different scales are correlated, whether they differ in their predictive validity, and which scale should be recommended for the assessment of the importance of naturalness for consumers in future studies. Because existing scales incorporated items that are also used for the validation of the scale and many scales only consider a restricted number of different aspect on naturalness, we constructed a new naturalness scale that covers the production process and the ingredients. To compare the scales, we conducted an online survey (n = 632) with participants from Germany. The results showed that the various scales are highly intercorrelated. All scales were good predictors of the purchase frequency of organic foods, perceived willingness to eat in-vitro meat and perceived naturalness of in-vitro meat but our new scale was not particularly better than the others. We conclude that the scales can be used interchangeably and we recommend using the shortest, and therefore, most efficient measure for the importance of naturalness. The results illuminate a general problem, new scales have been introduced without demonstrating that they measure something different than the existing scales.",

A presumed one-to-one combination of atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton to construct his first table of relative atomic weights from literature analyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binary compounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theory as an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compounds of the form AB2, however, atomic theory made quantitative predictions that were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory required that the weight of B in the compound AB2 be exactly twice that in the compound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston all published within a few years of each other experimental data that claimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. There are nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desired integral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replication experiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results are experimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explains why Wollaston's experiments were so influential. ",

The OASIS images were collected from online sources, and valence and arousal ratings were obtained in an online study (total N = 822). The valence and arousal ratings covered much of the circumplex space and were highly reliable and consistent across gender groups. OASIS has four advantages: (a) the stimulus set contains a large number of images in four categories; (b) the data were collected in 2015, and thus OASIS features more current images and reflects more current ratings of valence and arousal than do existing stimulus sets; (c) the OASIS database affords users the ability to interactively explore images by category and ratings; and, most critically, (d) OASIS allows for free use of the images in online and offline research studies, as they are not subject to the copyright restrictions that apply to the International Affective Picture System.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

In fact, one of the first things that freshmen in organic chemistry learn is how to join two molecules together to obtain a more complex one. Of course they still have a long way to go to become fully mature synthetic chemists, but they must have the primary instinct to build molecules, as synthesis is the essence of organic chemistry. With the different points of view that actually coexist in the chemical community about the maturity of the science (art, or both) of organic synthesis, it is clear that nowadays we know how to make almost all of the most complex molecules ever isolated. The primary question is how easy is it to accomplish? For the readers of papers describing the total synthesis of either simple or complex molecules, it appears that the routes followed are, most of the time, smooth and free of troubles. The synthetic scheme written on paper is, apparently, done in the laboratory with few, if any, modifications and these, essentially, seem to be based on finding the optimal experimental conditions to effect the desired reaction. Failures in the planned synthetic scheme to achieve the goal, detours imposed by unexpected reactivity, or the absence of reactivity are almost never discussed, since they may diminish the value of the work reported. This review attempts to look at total synthesis from a different side; it will focus on troubles found during the synthetic work that cause detours from the original synthetic plan, or on the dead ends that eventually may force redesign. From there, the evolution from the original route to the final successful one that achieves the synthetic target will be presented. The syntheses discussed in this paper have been selected because they contain explicit information about the failures of the original synthetic plan, together with the evolution of the final route to the target molecule. Therefore, they contain a lot of useful negative information that may otherwise be lost.",

Given the diversity of synthetic approaches utilized in MCRs, the highly diverse nature of the biological activities evaluated for the synthesized compounds, and considering their huge structural variability, much of the reported data are organized into concise schemes and tables to facilitate comparison, and to underscore the key points of this review.",

Simultaneously, methods were developed for assisting chemists in solving their fundamental questions such as the prediction of chemical, physical, or biological properties, the design of organic syntheses, and the elucidation of the structure of molecules. This eventually led to a discipline of its own: chemoinformatics.

The concept of QbD can be extended to analytical methods. QbD mandates the definition of a goal for the method, and emphasizes thorough evaluation and scouting of alternative methods in a systematic way to obtain optimal method performance. Candidate methods are then carefully assessed in a structured manner for risks, and are challenged to determine if robustness and ruggedness criteria are satisfied. As a result of these studies, the method performance can be understood and improved if necessary, and a control strategy can be defined to manage risk and ensure the method performs as desired when validated and deployed. In this review, the current state of analytical QbD in the industry is detailed with examples of the application of analytical QbD principles to a range of analytical methods, including high-performance liquid chromatography, Karl Fischer titration for moisture content, vibrational spectroscopy for chemical identification, quantitative color measurement, and trace analysis for genotoxic impurities.",

The process is intended to provide guidance for assuring that chemicals of concern are replaced with safer alternatives that are not likely to be later regretted. Conceptually, the assessment methods are developed from a set of three foundational pillars and five common principles. Based on a number of emerging alternatives assessment initiatives, in this commentary, we outline a chemical alternatives assessment blueprint structured around three broad steps: Scope, Assessment, and Selection and Implementation. Specific tasks and tools are identified for each of these three steps. While it is recognized that on-going practice will further refine and develop the method and tools, it is important that the structure of the assessment process remain flexible, adaptive, and focused on the substitution of chemicals of concern with safer alternatives.

One of the main characteristics of UVCBs is that they have no unique representation. Industry scientists who are part of the scientific community have been working with academics and consultants to address the problem of a lack of a defined structural description. It has been acknowledged that one of the obstacles is the large number of possible structural isomers. We have recently proposed and published a methodology, based on the generic substance identifiers, to address this issue. The methodology allows for the coding of constituents, their generation, calculation of important characteristics of UVCB constituents, and selection of representative constituents. In the present study we introduce a statistical selection of the minimum number of generated constituents representing a UVCB. This representative sample was selected in such a way that the structural variability and the properties of concern of the UVCB were approximated within a predefined tolerable error. The aim of the statistical selection was to enable the assessment of UVCB substances by decreasing the number of constituents that need to be evaluated. The procedure, which was shown to be endpoint-independent, was validated theoretically and on real case studies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:682-694. © 2019 SETAC.",

Their stories, and the background on which they were based, should serve to trace the evolution of the art of chemical synthesis to its present sharp condition, an emergence that occurred as a result of new theories and mechanistic insights, new reactions, new reagents and catalysts, and new synthetic technologies and strategies. Indeed, the advent of chemical synthesis as a whole must be considered as one of the most influential developments of the twentieth century in terms of its impact on society.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

An attempt has been made, whenever possible, to describe the enzymatic mechanisms of catalysis within the context of their synthetic counterparts and to discuss the mechanistic hypotheses for those reactions that are currently active areas of investigation. This Review has been categorized by reaction type, for example condensation, nucleophilic addition, reduction and oxidation, substitution, carboxylation, radical-mediated, and rearrangements, which are subdivided by name reactions.",

The application of these methods in the total synthesis of specific natural products in the author's laboratory is not discussed in extenso, but only by focusing on certain key steps which illustrate the application of the methods mentioned here. Methods discussed in this fashion are: cationic polyene cyclizations; the enamine alkylation and acylation of ketones and aldehydes; the metalloenamine alkylation; the regiospecific formation and trapping of enolates, via electron addition or via conjugate addition of organometallic reagents to enones; regiospecific enolate formation-trapping from saturated ketones and from beta-alkoxy enones; the epoxynitrile and the allylic epoxynitrile cyclizations; the cyclization of olefinic diazoketones; the cyclization of alkynyl ketones; protected cyanohydrins as acylcarbanion equivalents; the vinyl radical cyclization; the control of regio- and stereochemistry via radical cyclization to temporary rings.",

Without isolation or purification of individual compounds, deconvolution allows the evaluation of mixtures for biological activity. These libraries, if smartly designed, are becoming an essential source in the discovery and development of new molecules for pharmacology. The structurally diverse compounds are submitted to high throughput screening in a rapid search for lead compounds.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources. Data can also be accessed through CCDC and third party software applications and through an application programming interface. ",

Because of this inherent flexibility, users are often presented with diverse, even divergent, choices for solving every type of problem. Recently, CCP4 introduced CCP4i2, a modern graphical interface designed to help structural biologists to navigate the process of structure determination, with an emphasis on pipelining and the streamlined presentation of results. In addition, CCP4i2 provides a framework for writing structure-solution scripts that can be built up incrementally to create increasingly automatic procedures.",

The selected papers covered in this review must meet two mandatory requirements: (1) the reported products should be obtained via a multicomponent reaction; (2) the reported products should be biologically actives or at least tested for any biological property. Given the diversity of synthetic approaches utilized in MCRs, the highly diverse nature of the biological activities evaluated for the synthesized compounds, and considering their huge structural variability, much of the reported data are organized into concise schemes and tables to facilitate comparison, and to underscore the key points of this review.",

Because of this inherent flexibility, users are often presented with diverse, even divergent, choices for solving every type of problem. Recently, CCP4 introduced CCP4i2, a modern graphical interface designed to help structural biologists to navigate the process of structure determination, with an emphasis on pipelining and the streamlined presentation of results. In addition, CCP4i2 provides a framework for writing structure-solution scripts that can be built up incrementally to create increasingly automatic procedures.",

At times, different authors may use the same term to describe different concepts or the same rule is described by varying nomenclature. These ambiguities stand in the way of collaborative work, the design of experiments to assess the characteristics of colormaps, and automated colormap generation. In this paper, we review current and historical guidelines for colormap design. We propose a specified taxonomy and provide unambiguous mathematical definitions for the most common design rules.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

For example, using biosynthetic proposals to design a synthetic route can highlight alternative methods to the desired target. The pursuit of biomimetic syntheses also promotes the development of new reactions to prove or disprove a biosynthetic proposal or to unravel mechanistic implications of a proposed biosynthesis and can lead to the identification of new natural products.

In fact, one of the first things that freshmen in organic chemistry learn is how to join two molecules together to obtain a more complex one. Of course they still have a long way to go to become fully mature synthetic chemists, but they must have the primary instinct to build molecules, as synthesis is the essence of organic chemistry. With the different points of view that actually coexist in the chemical community about the maturity of the science (art, or both) of organic synthesis, it is clear that nowadays we know how to make almost all of the most complex molecules ever isolated. The primary question is how easy is it to accomplish? For the readers of papers describing the total synthesis of either simple or complex molecules, it appears that the routes followed are, most of the time, smooth and free of troubles. The synthetic scheme written on paper is, apparently, done in the laboratory with few, if any, modifications and these, essentially, seem to be based on finding the optimal experimental conditions to effect the desired reaction. Failures in the planned synthetic scheme to achieve the goal, detours imposed by unexpected reactivity, or the absence of reactivity are almost never discussed, since they may diminish the value of the work reported. This review attempts to look at total synthesis from a different side; it will focus on troubles found during the synthetic work that cause detours from the original synthetic plan, or on the dead ends that eventually may force redesign. From there, the evolution from the original route to the final successful one that achieves the synthetic target will be presented. The syntheses discussed in this paper have been selected because they contain explicit information about the failures of the original synthetic plan, together with the evolution of the final route to the target molecule. Therefore, they contain a lot of useful negative information that may otherwise be lost.",

Several hypotheses have been put forward, and the code has been analyzed extensively by authors looking for clues to selection pressures that might have acted during its evolution. But this approach has been ineffective. Although an impressive number of properties has been attributed to the universal code, it has been impossible to determine whether selection on any of these properties was important in the code's evolution or whether the observed properties arose as a consequence of selection on some other characteristic. Therefore we turned the question around and asked, what would a genetic code look like if it had evolved in response to various different selection pressures? To address this question, we constructed a genetic algorithm. We found first that selecting on a particular measure yields codes that are similar to each other. Second, we found that the universal code is far from minimized with respect to the effects of mutations (or translation errors) on the amino acid compositions of proteins. Finally, we found that the codes that most closely resembled real codes were those generated by selecting on aspects of the code's structure, not those generated by selecting to minimize the effects of amino acid substitutions on proteins. This suggests that the universal genetic code has been selected for a particular structure-a structure that confers an important flexibility on the evolution of genes and proteins-and that the particular assignments of amino acids to codons are secondary.",

Improvements on the original ccCA formalism include replacing the small basis set quadratic configuration interaction computation with a coupled cluster computation, employing a correction for scalar relativistic effects, utilizing the tight-d forms of the second-row correlation-consistent basis sets, and revisiting the basis set chosen for geometry optimization. With two types of complete basis set extrapolation of MP2 energies, ccCA results in an almost zero mean deviation for the G3/99 set (with a best value of -0.10 kcal mol(-1)), and a 0.96 kcal mol(-1) mean absolute deviation, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the G3X model chemistry. There are no optimized or empirical parameters included in the computation of ccCA energies.

The combinatorial fusion cascade mathematically describes the codon assignments in the standard genetic code. It explains the availability of amino acids with the even and odd numbers of codons, the appearance of stop codons, inclusion of novel canonical amino acids, exceptional high numbers of codons for amino acids arginine, leucine, and serine, and the temporal order of amino acid inclusion into the genetic code.

Initial conversion of the variety of functions to a Morse format, achieved using a simple graphical fitting procedure, allowed a direct comparison to be made, showing the COSMIC potential to differ considerably from the other potentials. This difference was reflected in the failure of COSMIC to reproduce ab initio and experimental energies for molecules with significant H..H interactions, with particular reference to the energy curves of benzophenone and diphenyl ether. Considerable improvement in these energies is produced by the use of a Morse function originally based on the H..H potential used in MM3.",

Despite apparent differences, in part due to very different ways of presenting them, these two approaches share some important characteristics: both are \"closed to efficient causation\", which means that they require nothing from their environment, and in particular not catalysts, apart from \"food\", or chemical species that allow for the production of energy. On the other hand Rosen insisted that a living organism cannot be regarded as a machine, whereas Gánti explicitly discussed its mechanical nature, and the enclosing boundary is explicitly created by the system itself in the chemoton, but is (at best) simply implicit in (M,R)-systems.

Improvements of ACORN, reported here and incorporated in the program ACORN2, have lowered the size of the fragment required and examples are given of structures solved with only 0.25% of the scattering power in the fragment, which may be a single atom. Applications of ACORN2 to structures with space group P1 have shown the remarkable property that when the starting point is a pair of equal atoms, or even a single atom placed at the origin, the refinement process breaks the centric nature of the initial phases and converges to phases corresponding to one of the two possible enantiomorphs. Examples are given of the application of ACORN2 to the solution and/or refinement of a number of known trial structures and to the refinement of structures when phases are available either from MAD or from a molecular-replacement model.",

In response, Lipinski and coworkers reported an analysis of compounds that successfully navigated Phase I and entered into Phase II clinical studies, and correlated the computed physicochemical properties of these molecules to their aqueous solubility, permeability, and oral bioavailability. In doing so, the authors created the \"Rule of Five,\" a mnemonic tool for medicinal chemists to use to quickly assess compounds during the drug discovery and optimization process with respect to the compounds' likelihood to display good solubility and permeability profiles. This overview outlines the basis for the Rule of Five, the ways in which it has been applied, and its impact on drug discovery and development.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Indeed, the advent of chemical synthesis as a whole must be considered as one of the most influential developments of the twentieth century in terms of its impact on society.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

We then discuss a number of important concepts involved in galvanic replacement, including the facet selectivity involved in the dissolution and deposition of metals, the impacts of alloying and dealloying on the structure and morphology of the final products, and methods for promoting or preventing a galvanic replacement reaction. We also illustrate how the capability of galvanic replacement can be enhanced to fabricate nanomaterials with complex structures and/or compositions by coupling with other processes such as co-reduction and the Kirkendall effect. Finally, we highlight the use of such novel metal nanostructures fabricated via galvanic replacement for applications ranging from catalysis to plasmonics and biomedical research, and conclude with remarks on prospective future directions.

The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique has shown great promise for producing high-quality 2D materials with superior electro-optical performance. However, it is difficult to synthesize continuous single-crystal 2D materials with large domain sizes and good uniformity due to the low vapor pressure of their precursors. It has been observed that the addition of selected synergistic additives to the CVD process under mild conditions can result in uniformly large-area and highly crystalline monolayer 2D materials with exceptional optical/electrical properties. Moreover, the 2D material-based devices chemically modified by synergistic additives can achieve superior performances compared to those previously reported.

This tutorial review summarizes the various top-down nanofabrication methods, with great emphasis on the chemical routes that can generate nanoporous materials and ordered arrays of nanostructures with three-dimensional features. The chemical top-down routes that are discussed in detail include (1) templated etching, (2) selective dealloying, (3) anisotropic dissolution, and (4) thermal decomposition.

In this review, we first highlight some of the many photochemical reactions that have been applied in orthogonal reaction protocols; the highly selective nature of photochemical reactions makes them well-suited for independent activation in the presence of other reaction components. The application of these orthogonal reactions, especially photochemical reactions, for the synthesis and modification of polymers and polymeric materials is also summarized.

Among the potential candidate molecules, metal-free or metal-containing conjugated organic molecules offer high-order electronic conjugation levels that can directly support fast charge carrier transport, rapid optoelectric responses, and reliable exciton manipulation. Early studies of these molecules focused on the design and synthesis of organic unit molecules that exhibit active electrical and optical properties when produced in the form of thin film devices. Since then, researchers have worked to enhance the properties upon crystallization of the unit molecules as single crystals provide higher carrier mobilities and exciton recombination yields. Most recently, researchers have conducted in-depth studies to understand how crystallization induces property changes, especially those that depend on specific crystal surfaces. The different properties that depend on the crystal facets have been of particular interest. Most unit molecules have anisotropic structures, and therefore produce crystals with several unique crystal facets with dissimilar molecular arrangements. These structural differences would also lead to diverse electrical conductance, optical absorption/emission, and even chemical interaction properties depending on the crystal facet investigated. To study the effects of crystallization and crystal facet-dependent property changes, researchers must grow or synthesize crystals of highly conjugated molecules that have both a variety of morphologies and high crystallinity. Morphologically well-defined organic crystals, that form structures such as wires, rods, disks, and cubes, provide objects that researchers can use to evaluate these material properties. Such structures typically occur as single crystals with well-developed facets with dissimilar molecular arrangements. Recently, researchers have proposed several approaches for the vapor and solution phase synthesis of high quality organic crystals with various morphologies. In this Account, we focus on methodologies for the synthesis of various organic- and metal-containing highly conjugated molecular crystals. We also examine the new optical and chemical properties of these materials. In addition, we introduce recent experimental results demonstrating that high crystallinity and specific molecular arrangements lead to crystallization-induced property changes. We believe that the understanding of the crystallization-induced property changes in organic crystals will provide both fundamental knowledge of the chemical processes occurring at various interfaces and opportunities for researchers to take advantage of crystallization-induced property changes in the development of high-performance organic devices.",

Considering the goal of chemical synthesis or property identification as optimal control problems provides insight into this good fortune. Both of these goals may be described by a fitness function J that depends on a suitable set of variables (e.g., reactant concentrations, components of a material, processing conditions, etc.). The relationship between J and the variables specifies the fitness landscape for the target objective. Upon making simple physical assumptions, this work demonstrates that the fitness landscape for chemical optimization contains no local sub-optimal maxima that may hinder attainment of the absolute best value of J. This feature provides a basis to explain the many reported efficient optimizations of synthesis conditions and molecular or material properties. We refer to this development as OptiChem theory.

Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Solid-state analyses combined with covalent disconnection and quantization of the liberated components allowed identification of a three-component monomeric unit repeated within a range of assembled oligomeric adducts whose repartition and binding capacity can be finely tuned through the starting stoichiometries. The self-assembly of these architectures occurs through the simultaneous creation of more than 25 covalent bonds per molecular entity. It appears that the thermodynamic selection is directed by the packing efficiency of these adducts, explaining the spectacular building block discrimination between homologues differing by one carbon unit. This selectivity, combined with the reversible nature of the system, provided pure molecular building blocks after a simple chemical disconnection, promoting CO(2) as a green auxiliary to purify polyaldehyde or polyamine from mixtures of homologous structures. Moreover, the gas template could be expelled as a pure compound under thermodynamic control.

There is a dearth of experimental data so computational quantum chemistry has stepped in to fill this breach and to verify whether particular experiments are in need of revision. A number of composite model chemistries (CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, G3, and G4) are used to compute theoretical atomization energies and hence enthalpies of formation at 0 and 298.15 K, and these are benchmarked against the best available compendium of values, the Active Thermochemical Tables or ATcT. In general the agreement is very good for some 28 species with the only discrepancy being for hydrazine. It is shown that, although individually the methods do not perform that well, collectively the mean unsigned error is &lt;1.7 kJ mol(-1); hence, this approach provides a useful tool to screen published values and validate new experimental results. Using multiple model chemistries does have some drawbacks but can produce good results even for challenging molecules like HOON and CN2O2. The results for these smaller validated molecules are then used as anchors for determining the formation enthalpies of larger species such as methylated hydrazines and diazenes, five- and six-membered heterocyclics via carefully chosen isodesmic working reactions with the aim of resolving some discrepancies in the literature and establishing a properly validated database.

It makes consistent use of the concept of bond-separation reactions to supply high-level precomputed bond increments which correct for errors of lower-level models. The present work extends the approach to the calculation of standard heats of formation and validates it by comparison to experimental and benchmark level ab initio data reported in the literature. Standard heats of formation (298 K) have been compiled for a large sample of 173 neutral molecules containing hydrogen and first-row atoms (C, N, O, F), resorting to several previous compilations and to the original experimental literature. Statistical evaluation shows that the simplest implementation of the ATOMIC protocol (composite model C) achieves an accuracy comparable to the popular Gaussian-3 approach and that composite models A and B perform better. Chemical accuracy (1-2 kcal/mol) is normally achieved even for larger systems with about 10 non-hydrogen atoms and for systems with charge-separated valence structures, bearing testimony to the robustness of the bond-separation reaction model. Effects of conformational averaging have been examined in detail for the series of n-alkanes, and our most refined composite model A reproduces experimental heats of formation quantitatively, provided that conformational averaging is properly accounted for. Several cases of larger discrepancy with respect to experiment are discussed, and potential weaknesses of the approach are identified.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The heats of formation (ΔHf,298) based on our best estimated atomization energies are 198.3 ± 5 kJ mol(-1) (CrO), -81.3 ± 5 kJ mol(-1) (CrO2), and -286.8 ± 20 kJ mol(-1) (CrO3). Standard G4-type composite methods yield atomization energies that are adequate for CrO, less good for CrO2, and least good for CrO3. CrO3 is highly multireference in character, and therefore, a \"black box\" approach of using a single-reference RHF wave function is inadequate, even for \"high-level\" G4-type methods. We find that, for CrO3, there is a very large difference in the G4 atomization energies depending on whether an RHF or a UHF reference is used, which is mainly associated with large differences in the MP4 components. In general, we propose that a large R-versus-U difference is likely to be an indication of potential problems in the theoretical treatment. Going beyond G4 to a more rigorous UCCSD(T)-based composite scheme [termed U-CM(3:[DZ,TZ]) in the present study], we again find a large difference (but significantly smaller than that for G4) between the CrO3 atomization energies based on RHF or UHF references. Intriguingly, the use of Brueckner orbitals as reference orbitals in all components, as in the corresponding Brueckner Doubles (BD) procedure [B-CM(3:[DZ,TZ])], produces results for CrO3 that are independent of whether RHF or UHF orbitals are used as the starting point.

It was shown that the gas-phase reaction of W with CO2 proceeds with a negligible barrier via an insertion pathway, W(7S)+CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta2-OCO)(6A')--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)(1A)--&gt;WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma). This oxidation process is calculated to be exothermic by 32.4 kcal/mol. Possible intermediates of this reaction are the W(eta2-OCO) and OWCO complexes, among which the latter is 37.4 kcal/mol more stable and lies 39.7 and 7.3 kcal/mol lower than the reactants, W(7S)+CO2(1A1), and the products, WO (3Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma), respectively. The barrier separating W(eta2-OCO) from OWCO is 8.0 kcal/mol (relative to the W(eta2-OCO) complex), which may be characterized as a W+delta-(CO2)-delta charge-transfer complex. Ionization of W does not change the character of the reaction of W with CO2: the reaction of W+ with CO2, like its neutral analog, proceeds via an insertion pathway and leads to oxidation of the W-center. The overall reaction W+(6D) + CO2(1A1)--&gt;W(eta1-OCO)+(6A)--&gt;OW(eta1-CO)+(4A)--&gt;WO+(4Sigma+)+CO(1Sigma) is calculated to be exothermic by 25.4 kcal/mol. The cationic reaction proceeds with a somewhat large (9.9 kcal/mol) barrier and produces two intermediates, W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) and OW(eta1-CO)+(4A). Intermediate W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) is 20.0 kcal/mol less stable than OW(eta1-CO)+(4A), and separated from the latter by a 35.2 kcal/mol barrier. Complex W(eta1-OCO)+(6A) is characterized as an ion-molecular complex type of W+-(CO2). Gas-phase reactions of M=W/W+ with CO lead to the formation of a W-carbonyl complex M(eta1-CO) for both M=W and W+.

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories.

The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection.

As well as structures that are made public to support scientific articles, it includes many structures published directly as CSD Communications. All structures are processed both computationally and by expert structural chemistry editors prior to entering the database. A key component of this processing is the reliable association of the chemical identity of the structure studied with the experimental data. This important step helps ensure that data is widely discoverable and readily reusable. Content is further enriched through selective inclusion of additional experimental data. Entries are available to anyone through free CSD community web services. Linking services developed and maintained by the CCDC, combined with the use of standard identifiers, facilitate discovery from other resources.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with <iNSR</i the interesting field of C-H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.",

With two types of complete basis set extrapolation of MP2 energies, ccCA results in an almost zero mean deviation for the G3/99 set (with a best value of -0.10 kcal mol(-1)), and a 0.96 kcal mol(-1) mean absolute deviation, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the G3X model chemistry.

The initial complimentary pairs and the protocodes are divided into dominant and recessive entities. The transitions between these stages obey the same combinatorial fusion rules for all amino acids. The combinatorial fusion cascade mathematically describes the codon assignments in the standard genetic code. It explains the availability of amino acids with the even and odd numbers of codons, the appearance of stop codons, inclusion of novel canonical amino acids, exceptional high numbers of codons for amino acids arginine, leucine, and serine, and the temporal order of amino acid inclusion into the genetic code. The temporal order of amino acids within the cascade is congruent with the consensus temporal order previously derived from the similarities between the available hypotheses.

The suite is designed to be flexible, allowing users a number of methods of achieving their aims. The programs are from a wide variety of sources but are connected by a common infrastructure provided by standard file formats, data objects and graphical interfaces. Structure solution by macromolecular crystallography is becoming increasingly automated and the CCP4 suite includes several automation pipelines. After giving a brief description of the evolution of CCP4 over the last 30 years, an overview of the current suite is given. While detailed descriptions are given in the accompanying articles, here it is shown how the individual programs contribute to a complete software package.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Only recently have organic chemists harnessed the powerful techniques of organic chemistry to study the functions of organic molecules in their biological hosts, the enzymes that synthesize molecules and the complex processes that occur in a cell. In this Perspective, I present a personal account of my entree into bioorganic chemistry as a physical organic chemist and subsequent work to understand the chemical mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, to develop techniques to identify and assign hydrogen bonds in tRNAs through NMR studies with isotopically labeled molecules, and to study how structure determines function in biosynthetic enzymes with proteins obtained by genetic engineering.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Synergistic effects between reactions, reagents and catalysts can lead to minor heats of reaction and occur as an inherent result of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) and their extensions. They enable syntheses to be performed at a low energy level and the number of synthesis steps to be drastically reduced in comparison with 'classical' two-component reactions, fulfilling the rules of <iGreen Chemistry</i.

A third Guareschi reaction, the so-called \"Guareschi 1897 reaction\", is one of the most unusual reactions in organic chemistry, involving the radical-mediated paradoxical aerobic generation of hydrocarbons in near-neutral water solution. A discussion of the mechanism of this amazing reaction, the only metal-free process that generates hydrocarbons, and the implications of the approach in biology and geosciences mirrors the multifaceted scientific personality of the discoverer. Thus, Guareschi's eclectic range of activities spans a surprising variety of topics, overcoming the boundaries of the traditional partition of chemistry into organic, inorganic, and analytical branches and systematically crosses the divide between pure and applied science as well as between the history of chemistry and the personal contributions to its development.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

They differ from other concerted reactions, such as S(N)2, E2, or pericyclic reactions, in such a way that atoms are involved in the transition state at which two bonds are made and two bonds are broken simultaneously. Similar to pericyclic reactions, an electron count can be used to predict reactivity and stereochemistry. The \"coarctate rules\" are derived from a topological variant of the aromaticity of the transition state principle. Pseudocoarctate transition states exhibit disconnections in the topology of orbital overlap and do not necessarily follow the coarctate rules.",

Yet neither strategy has met with much success. This could indicate that a satisfactory account of innateness needs to make use of the conceptual resources of cognitive science itself.

During the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive science-classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded cognition-will probably be integrated increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of intelligence.",

Accordingly, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the idea of \"novel beings\" represent exciting opportunities to revisit inquiries into the nature of moral responsibility. This paper expands upon my article \"Artificial Moral Responsibility: How We Can and Cannot Hold Machines Responsible\" and clarifies my reliance upon two competing views of responsibility. Although AI and novel beings are not close enough to us in kind to be considered candidates for the same sorts of responsibility we ascribe to our fellow human beings, contemporary theories show us the priority and adaptability of our moral attitudes and practices. This allows us to take seriously the social ontology of relationships that tie us together.

Central to this inquiry is the notion of agents that have goals, one of which is their own persistence, who use dynamically constructed knowledge to act in the world to achieve those goals. An agentive perspective explains why a special class of systems have a cluster of co-occurring capacities that enable them to exhibit adaptive behavior in a complex environment: perception, attention, memory, representation, planning, and communication. As an intellectual endeavor, cognitive science may not have achieved a hard core of uncontested assumptions that Lakatos (1978) identifies as emblematic of a successful research program, but there are alternative conceptions according to which cognitive science has been successful. First, challenges of the early, core tenet of \"Mind as Computation\" have helped put cognitive science on a stronger foundation-one that incorporates relations between minds and their environments. Second, even if a full cross-disciplinary theoretic consensus is elusive, cognitive science can inspire distant, deep, and transformative connections between pairs of fields. To be intellectually vital, cognitive science need not resemble a traditional discipline with its associated insularity and unchallenged assumptions. Instead, there is strength and resilience in the diverse perspectives and methods that cognitive science assembles together. This interdisciplinary enterprise is fragile and perhaps inherently unstable, as the looming absorption of cognitive science into psychology shows. Still, for many researchers, the excitement and benefits of triangulating on the nature of minds by integrating diverse cases cannot be secured by a stable discipline with an uncontested core of assumptions.",

A number of touchstone empirical phenomena that involve taxonomic similarity are described. We also examine phenomena involving more complex background knowledge about premises and conclusions of inductive arguments and the properties referenced. Earlier models are shown to give a good account of similarity-based phenomena but not knowledge-based phenomena. Recent models that aim to account for both similarity-based and knowledge-based phenomena are reviewed and evaluated. Among the most important new directions in induction research are a focus on induction with uncertain premise categories, the modeling of the relationship between inductive and deductive reasoning, and examination of the neural substrates of induction. A common theme in both the well-established and emerging lines of induction research is the need to develop well-articulated and empirically testable formal models of induction.

In this way, cognition becomes what finally characterises an organism as an autonomous agent. This perspective eliminates some misplaced questions, and helps to reframe old ones.

We argue that autocatalytic sets are a necessary (although not sufficient) condition for life-like behavior. We then elaborate on the suggestion that simple inorganic molecules like metals and minerals may have been the earliest catalysts in the formation of prebiotic autocatalytic sets, and how RAF theory may also be applied to systems beyond chemistry, such as ecology, economics, and cognition.",

Here, we study under what conditions such continuous learning (CL) may be more adaptive than simple reinforcement learning and examine how it could have evolved from the same basic associative elements. We use agent-based computer simulations to compare three learning strategies: simple reinforcement learning; reinforcement learning with chaining (RL-chain) and CL that applies the same associative mechanisms used by the other strategies, but also seeks statistical regularities in the relations among all items in the environment, regardless of the initial association with food. We show that a sufficiently structured environment favours the evolution of both RL-chain and CL and that CL outperforms the other strategies when food is relatively rare and the time for learning is limited. This advantage of internally motivated CL stems from its ability to capture statistical patterns in the environment even before they are associated with food, at which point they immediately become useful for planning.

First, insofar as cognitive mechanisms are information-processing mechanisms, cognitive science needs an account of how the representations invoked in cognitive mechanisms carry information about contents, and I suggest that control theory offers the needed perspective on the relation of representations to contents. Second, I argue that cognitive science requires, but is still in search of, a catalog of cognitive operations that researchers can draw upon in explaining cognitive mechanisms. Last, I provide a new perspective on the relation of cognitive science to brain sciences, one which embraces both reductive research on neural components that figure in cognitive mechanisms and a concern with recomposing higher-level mechanisms from their components and situating them in their environments.

In more complicated cases, however, it may be impossible to differentiate the equations, or very difficultly soluble non-linear equations may result. Many numerical optimization techniques to overcome these difficulties have been developed in the least ten years, and this review explains the logical basis of most of them, without going into the detail of computational procedures.The methods fall naturally into two classes - direct search methods, in which only values of the function to be minimized (or maximized) are used - and gradient methods, which also use derivatives of the function. The author considers all the accepted methods in each class, although warning that gradient methods should not be used unless the analytical differentiation of the function to be minimized is possible.If the solution is constrained, that is, certain values of the parameters are regarded as impossible or certain relations between the parameter values must be obeyed, the problem is more difficult.

Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures.

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

Toward a fuller appreciation of that power, this work begins with an elementary review of statistics fundamentals, and then progressively increases in sophistication as the coverage is extended to the theory and practice of linear and nonlinear least squares. The results are illustrated in application to data analysis problems important in the life sciences. The review of fundamentals includes the role of sampling and its connection to probability distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and the importance of finite variance. Linear least squares are presented using matrix notation, and the significance of the key probability distributions-Gaussian, chi-square, and t-is illustrated with Monte Carlo calculations. The meaning of correlation is discussed, including its role in the propagation of error. When the data themselves are correlated, special methods are needed for the fitting, as they are also when fitting with constraints. Nonlinear fitting gives rise to nonnormal parameter distributions, but the 10% Rule of Thumb suggests that such problems will be insignificant when the parameter is sufficiently well determined. Illustrations include calibration with linear and nonlinear response functions, the dangers inherent in fitting inverted data (e.g., Lineweaver-Burk equation), an analysis of the reliability of the van't Hoff analysis, the problem of correlated data in the Guggenheim method, and the optimization of isothermal titration calorimetry procedures using the variance-covariance matrix for experiment design.

Most practicing chemists view it as the electron-attracting power of an atom in a molecule. Various formulations of electronegativity have been proposed on this basis, and predictions made using different formulations generally agree reasonably well with each other and with chemical experience. A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

A broad range of disciplines, including process chemistry (organic synthesis), analytical chemistry, process engineering (mass and heat transfer, unit operations), process safety (chemical risk assessment), regulatory compliance, and plant operation, must be effectively applied. In the critical handover between medicinal chemistry and PR&amp;D, compound production is typically scaled up from a few hundred grams to several kilograms. Can the methodologies applied to the former also satisfy the technical, safety, and scalability aspects that come into play in the latter? Occasionally, the transition might occur smoothly, but more often the situation is the opposite: much work and resources must be invested to design a process that is feasible for manufacturing on pilot scale and, eventually, for commercial production. Authentic examples provide enlightening illustrations of dos and don'ts for developing syntheses designed for round-flask operation into production-scale processes. Factors that are easily underestimated or even neglected in the laboratory, such as method robustness, chemical hazards, safety concerns, environmental impact, availability of starting materials and building blocks in bulk quantities, intellectual property (IP) issues, and the final cost of the product, will come into play and need to be addressed appropriately. The decision on which route will be the best for further development is a crucial event and should come into focus early on the R&amp;D timeline. In addition to scientific and technical concerns, the parameter of speed has come to the forefront in the pharmaceutical arena. Although historically the drug industry has tolerated a total time investment of far more than 10 years from idea to market, the current worldwide paradigm requires a reduction to under 10 years for the specific segment covering preclinical development through launch. This change puts enormous pressure on the entire organization, and the implication for PR&amp;D is that the time allowed for conducting route design and scale-up has shrunk accordingly. Furthermore, molecular complexity has become extremely challenging in many instances, and demand steadily grows for process understanding and knowledge generation about low-level byproduct, which often must be controlled even at trace concentrations to meet regulatory specifications (especially in the case of potentially genotoxic impurities). In this Account, we paint a broad picture of the technical challenges the PR&amp;D community is grappling with today, focusing on what measures have been taken over the years to create more efficiency and effectiveness.",

QbD mandates the definition of a goal for the method, and emphasizes thorough evaluation and scouting of alternative methods in a systematic way to obtain optimal method performance. Candidate methods are then carefully assessed in a structured manner for risks, and are challenged to determine if robustness and ruggedness criteria are satisfied. As a result of these studies, the method performance can be understood and improved if necessary, and a control strategy can be defined to manage risk and ensure the method performs as desired when validated and deployed.

The adoption of AM technologies in this sector also allows a high degree of freedom of design and could exponentially reduce the time taken for the product to reach the market. In this arena, AM can be a method of producing lower volume and highly efficient intricate products with various materials like polymers, metals, ceramics and their composites. Although AM has been around for several years, its adoption in this sector has been slow and limited. As it is in the initial stages, rigorous research needs to be done to standardize the materials and manufacturing process. In addition, there is a particular need to end the requirement of a finishing procedure. Continuous and significant growth has been seen since the beginning and the successful outcomes until now allow for optimism that AM has a significant role in the future of manufacturing.

In addition, there are several approaches and frameworks focused on demonstrating that improvements were achieved through GC&amp;E technologies. However, the application of these principles is not always straightforward. We propose using systematic frameworks and tools that help practitioners when deciding which principles can be applied, the levels of implementation, prospective of obtaining simultaneous improvements in all sustainability aspects, and ways to deal with multiobjective problems. Therefore, this contribution aims to provide a systematic combination of three different and complementary design tools for assisting designers in evaluating, developing, and improving chemical manufacturing and materials management systems under GC&amp;E perspectives. The WAR Algorithm, GREENSCOPE, and SustainPro were employed for this synergistic approach of incorporating sustainability at early stages of process development. In this demonstration, simulated ammonia production is used as a case study to illustrate this advancement.

A broad range of disciplines, including process chemistry (organic synthesis), analytical chemistry, process engineering (mass and heat transfer, unit operations), process safety (chemical risk assessment), regulatory compliance, and plant operation, must be effectively applied. In the critical handover between medicinal chemistry and PR&amp;D, compound production is typically scaled up from a few hundred grams to several kilograms. Can the methodologies applied to the former also satisfy the technical, safety, and scalability aspects that come into play in the latter? Occasionally, the transition might occur smoothly, but more often the situation is the opposite: much work and resources must be invested to design a process that is feasible for manufacturing on pilot scale and, eventually, for commercial production. Authentic examples provide enlightening illustrations of dos and don'ts for developing syntheses designed for round-flask operation into production-scale processes. Factors that are easily underestimated or even neglected in the laboratory, such as method robustness, chemical hazards, safety concerns, environmental impact, availability of starting materials and building blocks in bulk quantities, intellectual property (IP) issues, and the final cost of the product, will come into play and need to be addressed appropriately. The decision on which route will be the best for further development is a crucial event and should come into focus early on the R&amp;D timeline. In addition to scientific and technical concerns, the parameter of speed has come to the forefront in the pharmaceutical arena. Although historically the drug industry has tolerated a total time investment of far more than 10 years from idea to market, the current worldwide paradigm requires a reduction to under 10 years for the specific segment covering preclinical development through launch. This change puts enormous pressure on the entire organization, and the implication for PR&amp;D is that the time allowed for conducting route design and scale-up has shrunk accordingly. Furthermore, molecular complexity has become extremely challenging in many instances, and demand steadily grows for process understanding and knowledge generation about low-level byproduct, which often must be controlled even at trace concentrations to meet regulatory specifications (especially in the case of potentially genotoxic impurities). In this Account, we paint a broad picture of the technical challenges the PR&amp;D community is grappling with today, focusing on what measures have been taken over the years to create more efficiency and effectiveness.",

This has been demonstrated by many theoretical and practical cases. In addition, there are several approaches and frameworks focused on demonstrating that improvements were achieved through GC&amp;E technologies. However, the application of these principles is not always straightforward. We propose using systematic frameworks and tools that help practitioners when deciding which principles can be applied, the levels of implementation, prospective of obtaining simultaneous improvements in all sustainability aspects, and ways to deal with multiobjective problems. Therefore, this contribution aims to provide a systematic combination of three different and complementary design tools for assisting designers in evaluating, developing, and improving chemical manufacturing and materials management systems under GC&amp;E perspectives. The WAR Algorithm, GREENSCOPE, and SustainPro were employed for this synergistic approach of incorporating sustainability at early stages of process development. In this demonstration, simulated ammonia production is used as a case study to illustrate this advancement. Results show how to identify process design areas for improvements, key factors, multicriteria decision-making solutions, and optimal trade-offs.

QbD mandates the definition of a goal for the method, and emphasizes thorough evaluation and scouting of alternative methods in a systematic way to obtain optimal method performance. Candidate methods are then carefully assessed in a structured manner for risks, and are challenged to determine if robustness and ruggedness criteria are satisfied. As a result of these studies, the method performance can be understood and improved if necessary, and a control strategy can be defined to manage risk and ensure the method performs as desired when validated and deployed.

This paper provides an updated estimate of the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on additive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the literature where this technology is cost effective. The paper then goes on to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal costs and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and a resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends in the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an estimated $667 million in value added produced using additive manufacturing, which equates to 0.01 % of total global manufacturing value added. US value added is estimated as $241 million. Current research on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is cost effective for manufacturing small batches with continued centralized production; however, with increased automation distributed production may become cost effective. Due to the complexities of measuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current studies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine the production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend not to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation costs along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive manufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant portion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are declining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have resulted in this technology representing 0.02 % of the relevant manufacturing industries in the US; however, as the costs of additive manufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely adopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer interactions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing reveals that for this technology to exceed $4.4 billion in 2020, $16.0 billion in 2025, and $196.8 billion in 2035 it would need to deviate from its current trends of adoption.",

With the advent of smart manufacturing technologies-better production equipment, sensing technologies, computational methods, and data analytics applied from the process to enterprise levels-the potential for sustainability performance improvement is tremendous. Sustainable manufacturing seeks the best balance of a variety of performance measures to satisfy and optimize the goals of all stakeholders. Accurate measures of performance are the foundation on which sustainability objectives can be pursued. Historically, operational and information technologies have undergone disparate development, with little convergence across the domains. To focus future research efforts in advanced manufacturing, the authors organized a one-day workshop, sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, at the joint manufacturing research conferences of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Research needs were identified to help harmonize disparate manufacturing metrics, models, and methods from across conventional manufacturing, nanomanufacturing, and additive/hybrid manufacturing processes and systems. Experts from academia and government labs presented invited lightning talks to discuss their perspectives on current advanced manufacturing research challenges. Workshop participants also provided their perspectives in facilitated brainstorming breakouts and a reflection activity. The aim was to define advanced manufacturing research and educational needs for improving manufacturing process performance through improved sustainability metrics, modeling approaches, and decision support methods. In addition to these workshop outcomes, a review of the recent literature is presented, which identifies research opportunities across several advanced manufacturing domains.

Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran. According to Dr. Juran, this view is pure chauvinist nonsense. Despite the shoddiness of Japanese consumer goods before the war, the Japanese did have a quality tradition in the superb workmanship of certain ancient crafts and in the design and manufacture of their military hardware, which, at the outset of the war, was highly competitive with our own. It was just that the Japanese had never devoted engineering expertise, capital, or management attention to the quality of exportable consumer goods. The shock of losing the war changed that mind-set. When Dr. Juran first lectured in Japan in 1954, his audience consisted of 140 CEOs. He had given the very same lectures dozens of times in the United States, but never to top management. American CEOs concentrated their attention on financial reports. Quality was a discipline that they delegated to engineers and special quality departments. In Japan, senior executives took personal charge of managing for quality; trained their managers, engineers, and employees in quality methods; developed quality measurements; pursued quality change at a revolutionary pace; and kept at it year after year until, by the mid-1970s, Japan had passed the United States in quality manufacturing. The unsung heroes of the Japanese quality revolution were Japanese managers, not American experts.

We thereby single out six metals for enhanced concern: dysprosium, samarium, vanadium, niobium, tellurium, and gallium. From that perspective, the use of critical metals in low concentrations in alloys unlikely to be routinely recycled should be avoided if possible.

The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique has shown great promise for producing high-quality 2D materials with superior electro-optical performance. However, it is difficult to synthesize continuous single-crystal 2D materials with large domain sizes and good uniformity due to the low vapor pressure of their precursors. It has been observed that the addition of selected synergistic additives to the CVD process under mild conditions can result in uniformly large-area and highly crystalline monolayer 2D materials with exceptional optical/electrical properties. Moreover, the 2D material-based devices chemically modified by synergistic additives can achieve superior performances compared to those previously reported.

These findings are of great importance for modern heterogeneous catalysis research. First, a rational synthesis of catalysts might be achieved, since desired activity and selectivity would be acquired by simply tuning the shape, that is, the exposed crystal facets, of a NC catalyst. Second, shape-controlled NCs are relatively simple systems, in contrast to traditional complex solids, suggesting that they may serve as novel model catalysts to bridge the gap between model surfaces and real catalysts.",

Among the potential candidate molecules, metal-free or metal-containing conjugated organic molecules offer high-order electronic conjugation levels that can directly support fast charge carrier transport, rapid optoelectric responses, and reliable exciton manipulation. Early studies of these molecules focused on the design and synthesis of organic unit molecules that exhibit active electrical and optical properties when produced in the form of thin film devices. Since then, researchers have worked to enhance the properties upon crystallization of the unit molecules as single crystals provide higher carrier mobilities and exciton recombination yields. Most recently, researchers have conducted in-depth studies to understand how crystallization induces property changes, especially those that depend on specific crystal surfaces. The different properties that depend on the crystal facets have been of particular interest. Most unit molecules have anisotropic structures, and therefore produce crystals with several unique crystal facets with dissimilar molecular arrangements. These structural differences would also lead to diverse electrical conductance, optical absorption/emission, and even chemical interaction properties depending on the crystal facet investigated. To study the effects of crystallization and crystal facet-dependent property changes, researchers must grow or synthesize crystals of highly conjugated molecules that have both a variety of morphologies and high crystallinity. Morphologically well-defined organic crystals, that form structures such as wires, rods, disks, and cubes, provide objects that researchers can use to evaluate these material properties. Such structures typically occur as single crystals with well-developed facets with dissimilar molecular arrangements. Recently, researchers have proposed several approaches for the vapor and solution phase synthesis of high quality organic crystals with various morphologies. In this Account, we focus on methodologies for the synthesis of various organic- and metal-containing highly conjugated molecular crystals. We also examine the new optical and chemical properties of these materials. In addition, we introduce recent experimental results demonstrating that high crystallinity and specific molecular arrangements lead to crystallization-induced property changes. We believe that the understanding of the crystallization-induced property changes in organic crystals will provide both fundamental knowledge of the chemical processes occurring at various interfaces and opportunities for researchers to take advantage of crystallization-induced property changes in the development of high-performance organic devices.",

Broadly speaking, two classes of compounds will be discussed: those based upon molecules or ions linked into networks via noncovalent interactions and those (coordination polymers) in which metal centres are linked using coordination bonds through bridging ligands into extended networks.",

However, COFs are produced as insoluble and unprocessable solids, which precludes the preparation of thin films for optoelectronic applications. Here, we report designed synthesis of a highly soluble yet crystalline COF material through the regulation of its inter-layer interactions. The resulting COF is remarkably soluble in a variety of organic solvents and forms stable true solutions with retention of its layered structure. These unique features endow the COF with solution processability; high-quality, large-area COF films can be produced on various substrates in a high-throughput and efficient manner, with good control over the film thickness, making this material compatible with a variety of device applications. The films are electrically anisotropic; the intra-layer carrier conduction is inhibited, while the inter-layer carrier migration is outstanding, showing the highest conductivity among all reported COF materials. Our highly soluble and processable COF may open new pathways for realising high-performance COF-based optoelectronic devices with diverse functions.",

However, CNTs have not yet made a major leap into industry, especially for electronic devices, because of fabrication challenges. This review provides an overview of state-of-the-art of CNT synthesis techniques and illustrates their major technical difficulties. It also charts possible in situ analyses and new reactor designs that might enable commercialization. After a brief description of the CNT properties and of the various techniques used to synthesize substrate-free CNTs, the bulk of this review analyzes chemical vapor deposition (CVD). This technique receives special attention since it allows CNTs to be grown in predefined locations, provides a certain degree of control of the types of CNTs grown, and may have the highest chance to succeed commercially. Understanding the primary growth mechanisms at play during CVD is critical for controlling the properties of the CNTs grown and remains the major hurdle to overcome. Various factors that influence CNT growth receive a special focus: choice of catalyst and substrate materials, source gases, and process parameters. This review illustrates important considerations for in situ characterization and new reactor designs that may enable researchers to better understand the physical growth mechanisms and to optimize the synthesis of CNTs, thus contributing to make carbon nanotubes a manufacturing reality.",

Among the various couplings that were successfully transferred from solution to solid surfaces, Ullmann coupling is arguably the most reliable, controllable, and widespread coupling reaction. The basic reaction scheme is straightforward: halogenated precursors are deposited onto solid surfaces, normally of coinage metals. In the adsorbed state the halogen substitutents are split off by virtue of the surface's reactivity, thereby generating acitvated species that subsequently recombine by forming C-C bonds. Ullmann coupling is well suited for reticular synthesis of novel organic nanostructures: ideally, the halogen substitution pattern of the precursor - which becomes the monomer upon dehalogenation - predetermines dimensionality and topology of the covalent nanostructures. Also in many relevant systems, side-reactions do not occur. However, in reality topological defects, competing C-H activation on more reactive surfaces, and reaction intermediates render this seemingly simple coupling reaction not only more complex, but also more interesting for fundamental research. This feature article aims to provide an account of the vast amount of already published work and tries to destill important findings and currents trends in surface-assisted Ullmann coupling.",

QbD mandates the definition of a goal for the method, and emphasizes thorough evaluation and scouting of alternative methods in a systematic way to obtain optimal method performance. Candidate methods are then carefully assessed in a structured manner for risks, and are challenged to determine if robustness and ruggedness criteria are satisfied. As a result of these studies, the method performance can be understood and improved if necessary, and a control strategy can be defined to manage risk and ensure the method performs as desired when validated and deployed.

Specific tasks and tools are identified for each of these three steps. While it is recognized that on-going practice will further refine and develop the method and tools, it is important that the structure of the assessment process remain flexible, adaptive, and focused on the substitution of chemicals of concern with safer alternatives.

This dramatically changed the drug discovery process and the way of thinking of synthetic chemists. In addition, combinatorial strategies became useful in areas such as pharmaceutical research, agrochemistry, catalyst design, and materials research.

One of the main characteristics of UVCBs is that they have no unique representation. Industry scientists who are part of the scientific community have been working with academics and consultants to address the problem of a lack of a defined structural description. It has been acknowledged that one of the obstacles is the large number of possible structural isomers. We have recently proposed and published a methodology, based on the generic substance identifiers, to address this issue. The methodology allows for the coding of constituents, their generation, calculation of important characteristics of UVCB constituents, and selection of representative constituents. In the present study we introduce a statistical selection of the minimum number of generated constituents representing a UVCB. This representative sample was selected in such a way that the structural variability and the properties of concern of the UVCB were approximated within a predefined tolerable error. The aim of the statistical selection was to enable the assessment of UVCB substances by decreasing the number of constituents that need to be evaluated. The procedure, which was shown to be endpoint-independent, was validated theoretically and on real case studies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:682-694. © 2019 SETAC.",

However, the shift is being slowed by the shortage of accurate, reliable, and inexpensive sensing devices. Although the past two decades saw no new major theoretical or methodological advances, several important incremental improvements and extensions have been made to help the ripening of the technologies developed in the preceding two decades. Control is regaining its importance owing to society's renewed focus on energy and the maturation of various emerging technologies, but a community-wide consensus on what general problems should be solved is lacking.

The changes we describe improve the quality of solutions found for large-scale designs, and allow them to be found in hours rather than days.

However, leading axiomatic approaches to decision-based design suggest that combining preferences across these elements is virtually guaranteed to result in irrational outcomes. This has led some to conclude that a single \"dictator\" is required to make design decisions. In contrast, proponents of heuristic approaches observe that aggregate decisions are frequently made in practice, and argue that this widespread usage justifies the value of these heuristics to the engineering design community. This paper demonstrates that these approaches need not be mutually exclusive. Axiomatic approaches can be informed by empirically motivated restrictions on the way that individuals can order their preferences. These restrictions are represented using \"anigrafs\"-structured relationships between alternatives that are represented using a graph-theoretic formalism. This formalism allows for a computational assessment of the likelihood of irrational outcomes. Simulation results show that even minimal amounts of structure can vastly reduce the likelihood of irrational outcomes at the level of the group, and that slightly stronger restrictions yield probabilities of irrational preferences that never exceed 5%. Next, an empirical case study demonstrates how anigrafs may be extracted from survey data, and a model selection technique is introduced to examine the goodness-of-fit of these anigrafs to preference data. Taken together, these results show how axiomatic consistency can be combined with empirical correspondence to determine the circumstances under which \"dictators\" are necessary in design decisions.",

Have at least two design conferences while you are preparing your research proposal--more if you feel that you need them. 2. Identify and invite the best experts possible from inside and outside your institution to discuss your questions. 3. Prepare a draft of your proposal as well as a list of your questions and give these to your experts at least 1 week in advance so they can prepare for the design conference. 4.

Typically the aim is to incorporate as much knowledge into the design as possible. This knowledge may relate to the target protein itself or may be derived from known active and inactive compounds. Other factors should also be taken into account, such as the cost of the library and the physicochemical properties of the compounds that are contained within the library. Thus, library design is a multi objective optimization problem. Most approaches to optimizing multiple objectives are based on aggregation methods whereby the objectives are assigned relative weights and are combined into a single fitness function. A more recent approach involves the use of a Multiobjective Genetic Algorithm in which the individual objectives are handled independently without the need to assign weights. The result is a family of solutions each of which represents a different compromise in the objectives. Thus, the library designer is able to make an informed choice on an appropriate compromise solution.",

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)].

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The latter, called structural color or iridescence, has long been a problem of scientific interest. Recently, structural colors have attracted great interest because their applications have been rapidly progressing in many fields related to vision, such as the paint, automobile, cosmetics, and textile industries. As the research progresses, however, it has become clear that these colors are due to the presence of surprisingly minute microstructures, which are hardly attainable even by ultramodern nanotechnology. Fundamentally, most of the structural colors originate from basic optical processes represented by thin-film interference, multilayer interference, a diffraction grating effect, photonic crystals, light scattering, and so on. However, to enhance the perception of the eyes, natural creatures have produced various designs, in the course of evolution, to fulfill simultaneously high reflectivity in a specific wavelength range and the generation of diffusive light in a wide angular range. At a glance, these two characteristics seem to contradict each other in the usual optical sense, but these seemingly conflicting requirements are realized by combining appropriate amounts of regularity and irregularity of the structure. In this Review, we first explain the fundamental optical properties underlying the structural colors, and then survey these mysteries of nature from the viewpoint of regularity and irregularity of the structure. Finally, we propose a general principle of structural colors based on structural hierarchy and show their up-to-date applications.",

Structural colouration is a visible consequence of the particular patterning of a reflecting surface with regular structures at submicron length scales. Structural colours usually appear bright, shiny, iridescent or with a metallic look, as a result of physical processes such as diffraction, interference, or scattering with a typically small dissipative loss. These features have recently attracted much research effort in materials science, chemistry, engineering and physics, in order to understand and produce structural colours. In these early stages of photonics, researchers facing an infinite array of possible colour-producing structures are heavily inspired by the elaborate architectures they find in nature. We review here the recent technological strategies employed to artificially mimic the structural colours found in nature, as well as some of their current and potential applications.",

The adaptive features of organisms could now be explained, like the phenomena of the inanimate world, as the result of natural processes, without recourse to an Intelligent Designer. The Copernican and the Darwinian Revolutions may be seen as the two stages of the one Scientific Revolution. They jointly ushered in the beginning of science in the modern sense of the word: explanation through natural laws. Darwin's theory of natural selection accounts for the \"design\" of organisms, and for their wondrous diversity, as the result of natural processes, the gradual accumulation of spontaneously arisen variations (mutations) sorted out by natural selection. Which characteristics will be selected depends on which variations happen to be present at a given time in a given place. This in turn depends on the random process of mutation as well as on the previous history of the organisms. Mutation and selection have jointly driven the marvelous process that, starting from microscopic organisms, has yielded orchids, birds, and humans. The theory of evolution conveys chance and necessity, randomness and determinism, jointly enmeshed in the stuff of life.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

(3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

Various formulations of electronegativity have been proposed on this basis, and predictions made using different formulations generally agree reasonably well with each other and with chemical experience. A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others. Outliers in agreement with other scales are oxygen and fluorine, now somewhat less electronegative, but in better agreement with their chemistry with the noble gas elements. Group 11 and 12 electronegativities emerge as high, although Au less so than in other scales. Our scale also gives relatively high electronegativities for Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Tc, Cd, Hg (affected by choice of valence state), and Gd.

Improvements on the original ccCA formalism include replacing the small basis set quadratic configuration interaction computation with a coupled cluster computation, employing a correction for scalar relativistic effects, utilizing the tight-d forms of the second-row correlation-consistent basis sets, and revisiting the basis set chosen for geometry optimization. With two types of complete basis set extrapolation of MP2 energies, ccCA results in an almost zero mean deviation for the G3/99 set (with a best value of -0.10 kcal mol(-1)), and a 0.96 kcal mol(-1) mean absolute deviation, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the G3X model chemistry. There are no optimized or empirical parameters included in the computation of ccCA energies.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature.

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

Because of this inherent flexibility, users are often presented with diverse, even divergent, choices for solving every type of problem. Recently, CCP4 introduced CCP4i2, a modern graphical interface designed to help structural biologists to navigate the process of structure determination, with an emphasis on pipelining and the streamlined presentation of results. In addition, CCP4i2 provides a framework for writing structure-solution scripts that can be built up incrementally to create increasingly automatic procedures.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis.

In contrast, discovery is the potential strength of combinatorial chemistry. Careful design is most important for the synthesis of useful libraries, since the diversity of the periodic table is much too large to be accessed comprehensively or systematically by such large libraries.",

It requires careful handling and special techniques for crystallisation, but the efforts seem to be rewarding when attaining co-crystals with small molecules as partners. Many basic questions such as the dominance of specific heterogeneous intermolecular interactions, their driving force for the formation of multicomponent crystals instead of neat ones are expected to be easily analysed. The underlying packing patterns and resulting stoichiometries based on the known supramolecular synthons seem to be straightforward for such small molecules and crystal engineering, considered as the prototype of supramolecular synthesis, should be a simple task. Nineteen co-crystals with acetylene are presented in this paper, some of which have been previously reported individually. An attempt has been made to find features shared by the groups of co-crystals, including those that could not be co-crystallised. But in spite of clear ideas and experiences from previous experiments, surprisingly almost none of systems reached our expectations. Our intuitive approach was not fulfilled, which demonstrates that multicomponent crystals even of small molecules will remain a great challenge for theoretical methods and the crystal structures shown herein represent good candidates for future testing.

MCRs can be very useful in supramolecular chemistry, especially to produce novel supramolecular derivatives. Therefore, there are several reports of highly-functionalized calix[4]arene derivatives obtained by MCRs instead of conventional stepwise protocols during the last decade. In this paper, we have particularly focused on the exploitation of upper rim and lower rim substituted calix[4]arenes in multicomponent approaches as a facile and convenient synthetic strategy. The value of this method lies in its operational simplicity, mild reaction conditions and structural diversity of the products. Interestingly, in most cases the products afforded by this method offer unique features and applications which are highlighted in the following sections.",

As a result, fulvene cycloaddition chemistry has been employed extensively for the synthesis of natural products. More recently, fulvene cycloaddition chemistry has also found application to other areas including materials chemistry and dynamic combinatorial chemistry. This highlight article discusses the unusual properties of fulvenes and their varied cycloaddition chemistry, focussing on applications in organic and natural synthesis, dynamic combinatorial chemistry and materials chemistry, including dynamers, hydrogels and charge transfer complexes.

In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

In this approach, C-H bonds are typically added across π-bonds or π-bond isosteres, followed by subsequent coupling to another type of functionality, thereby forming two σ-bonds in a single reaction sequence. Many sequential C-H bond addition reactions have been developed to date, including additions across both conjugated and isolated π-systems followed by coupling with reactants such as carbonyl compounds, cyanating reagents, aminating reagents, halogenating reagents, oxygenating reagents, and alkylating reagents. These atom-economical reactions transform ubiquitous C-H bonds under mild conditions to more complex structures with a high level of regiochemical and stereochemical control. Surprising connectivities and diverse mechanisms have been elucidated in the development of these reactions.

It requires careful handling and special techniques for crystallisation, but the efforts seem to be rewarding when attaining co-crystals with small molecules as partners. Many basic questions such as the dominance of specific heterogeneous intermolecular interactions, their driving force for the formation of multicomponent crystals instead of neat ones are expected to be easily analysed. The underlying packing patterns and resulting stoichiometries based on the known supramolecular synthons seem to be straightforward for such small molecules and crystal engineering, considered as the prototype of supramolecular synthesis, should be a simple task. Nineteen co-crystals with acetylene are presented in this paper, some of which have been previously reported individually. An attempt has been made to find features shared by the groups of co-crystals, including those that could not be co-crystallised. But in spite of clear ideas and experiences from previous experiments, surprisingly almost none of systems reached our expectations. Our intuitive approach was not fulfilled, which demonstrates that multicomponent crystals even of small molecules will remain a great challenge for theoretical methods and the crystal structures shown herein represent good candidates for future testing. On the other hand, we wish to encourage other groups to present their views on the crystal structures with an unbiased approach that may offer a better explanation than we are able to outline in this article.",

Template-directed synthesis--or expressed another way, supramolecular assistance to covalent synthesis--relies on the use of reversible noncovalent bonding interactions between molecular building blocks in order to preorganise them into a certain relative geometry as a prelude to covalent bond formation to afford the thermodynamically preferred product. The use of this so-called dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) in templated reactions allows for an additional amount of reversibility, further eliminating potential kinetic products by allowing the covalent bonds that are formed during the template-directed reaction to be 'proofread for errors', thus making it possible for the reaction to search out its thermodynamic minimum. The marriage of template-directed synthesis with DCC has allowed chemists to construct an increasingly complex collection of compounds from relatively simple precursors. This new paradigm in organic synthesis requires that each individual piece in the molecular self-assembly process is preprogrammed so that the multiple recognition events expressed between the pieces are optimised in a highly cooperative manner in the desired product. It offers an extremely simple way of making complex mechanically interlocked compounds--e.g., catenanes, rotaxanes, suitanes, Borromean rings and Solomon knots--from relatively simple precursors.",

The elastic constants, bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, and Poisson's ratio were obtained. These results indicate that CaAlSiN3 is mechanically stable and a relatively hard material. Moreover, this compound has an indirect band gap of ∼3.4 eV according to its band structure and density of states. The linear photon energy dependent dielectric functions and related optical properties including the refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption spectrum, reflectivity, and energy loss spectrum were computed and discussed. It is shown that no sizable anisotropy is found in the optical properties of CaAlSiN3. The obtained structural estimation and some other results are in agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. This investigation is not only helpful for better understanding the electronic, mechanical and optical properties of CaAlSiN3, but also will open up the possibility of its use in device applications.

The main difficulties during the manufacturing/processing of hard-to-cut materials are attributed to their high hardness and abrasion resistance, high strength at room or elevated temperatures, increased thermal conductivity, as well as their resistance to oxidation and corrosion. Nowadays the group of hard-to-cut materials includes the metallic materials, composites, as well as ceramics. This special issue, \"Advances in Hard-to-Cut Materials: Manufacturing, Properties, Process Mechanics and Evaluation of Surface Integrity\" provides a collection of research papers regarding the various problems correlated with hard-to-cut materials.

It may be that in complex fields this is inevitable, for science invokes subtle abstractions which are necessarily concerned sequentially with parts rather than simultaneously with a whole system. But how enormously better off we are now than we were in 1900, for we at least now understand the physical principles behind most of the properties of ceramics and metals, and more than one practical achievement stems directly from a scientist's suggestion. No practical man now understands metals better than the solid-state physicist; this was certainly not true even as little as 20 years ago. Yet the likelihood that pure science will lead directly to the discovery of really new materials will be only slightly greater in the future than it was in the past unless methods for handling wholes can be developed that are precise enough to be called scientific and communicable enough to be taught. This is a task that the scientist has in the past rightly and profitably refused to accept. We need a supergenius to develop some principles, not of simple particles and their interactions, but of extremely complex structures with parts interacting with other parts, on all levels, and with a hierarchy of interpenetrating substructures combining to form many levels of interpenetrating superstructure (21).",

Here we summarize the mechanical properties of organic crystals that have been reported over the past three decades, and we establish a global mechanical property profile that can be used to predict and identify mechanically robust organic crystals. Being composed of light elements, organic crystals populate a narrow region in the mechanical property-density space between soft, disordered organic materials and stiff, ordered materials. Two subsets of extraordinarily stiff and hard organic crystalline materials were identified and rationalized by the normalized number density, strength, and directionality of their intermolecular interactions. We conclude that future lightweight, soft, all-organic components in devices should capitalize on the greatest asset of organic single crystals-namely, the combination of long-range structural order and softness.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In fact, one of the first things that freshmen in organic chemistry learn is how to join two molecules together to obtain a more complex one. Of course they still have a long way to go to become fully mature synthetic chemists, but they must have the primary instinct to build molecules, as synthesis is the essence of organic chemistry. With the different points of view that actually coexist in the chemical community about the maturity of the science (art, or both) of organic synthesis, it is clear that nowadays we know how to make almost all of the most complex molecules ever isolated. The primary question is how easy is it to accomplish? For the readers of papers describing the total synthesis of either simple or complex molecules, it appears that the routes followed are, most of the time, smooth and free of troubles. The synthetic scheme written on paper is, apparently, done in the laboratory with few, if any, modifications and these, essentially, seem to be based on finding the optimal experimental conditions to effect the desired reaction. Failures in the planned synthetic scheme to achieve the goal, detours imposed by unexpected reactivity, or the absence of reactivity are almost never discussed, since they may diminish the value of the work reported. This review attempts to look at total synthesis from a different side; it will focus on troubles found during the synthetic work that cause detours from the original synthetic plan, or on the dead ends that eventually may force redesign. From there, the evolution from the original route to the final successful one that achieves the synthetic target will be presented. The syntheses discussed in this paper have been selected because they contain explicit information about the failures of the original synthetic plan, together with the evolution of the final route to the target molecule. Therefore, they contain a lot of useful negative information that may otherwise be lost.",

This thought is not a far-fetched description of the work of a synthetic chemist pursuing the total synthesis of a natural product. At the end of the day, he or she will be judged by the artistry of the final work and the weight of the gold discovered in the process. However, as colorful as this description of total synthesis may be, it does not entirely capture the essence of the endeavor, for there is much more to be told, especially with regard to the contrast of frustrating failures and exhilarating moments of discovery. To fully appreciate the often Herculean nature of the task and the rewards that accompany it, one must sense the details of the enterprise behind the scenes. A more vivid description of total synthesis as a struggle against a tough opponent is perhaps appropriate to dramatize these elements of the experience. In this article we describe one such endeavor of total synthesis which, in addition to reaching the target molecule, resulted in a wealth of new synthetic strategies and technologies for chemical synthesis. The total synthesis of the CP molecules is compared to Theseus' most celebrated athlos (Greek for exploit, accomplishment): the conquest of the dreaded Minotaur, which he accomplished through brilliance, skill, and bravery having traversed the famous labyrinth with the help of Ariadne. This story from Greek mythology comes alive in modern synthetic expeditions toward natural products as exemplified by the total synthesis of the CP molecules which serve as a paradigm for modern total synthesis endeavors, where the objectives are discovery and invention in the broader sense of organic synthesis.",

QbD mandates the definition of a goal for the method, and emphasizes thorough evaluation and scouting of alternative methods in a systematic way to obtain optimal method performance. Candidate methods are then carefully assessed in a structured manner for risks, and are challenged to determine if robustness and ruggedness criteria are satisfied. As a result of these studies, the method performance can be understood and improved if necessary, and a control strategy can be defined to manage risk and ensure the method performs as desired when validated and deployed. In this review, the current state of analytical QbD in the industry is detailed with examples of the application of analytical QbD principles to a range of analytical methods, including high-performance liquid chromatography, Karl Fischer titration for moisture content, vibrational spectroscopy for chemical identification, quantitative color measurement, and trace analysis for genotoxic impurities.",

The risk depends on many factors that can be divided into three main groups: <bindividual related</b-starting from the individual's genomic makeup, age, sex, environment, and even diet and psychological state, which in turn alter the individual's response to contamination and to any active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); <bformulation related</b-the API's cleanability, solubility, batch size, maximum daily dose, and most importantly permitted daily exposure (PDE), which covers the toxicological profile of this API, including its genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, sensitizing potential, or any adverse effects that would result from long- or short - term cross contamination; and <bfacility related</b-as the machine shared surface area between Product A as the contaminant and Product B as the contaminated. The following approach is based on EMA recommendations on health - based exposure limits. It aims to address all three of the aforementioned groups to give a scientific rationale on how to evaluate the cleaning process efficiency.<iLAY ABSTRACT:</i This manuscript aims to provide a health-based exposure limit for acceptable carryover of one pharmaceutical product to another in a multiproduct pharmaceutical facility, owing to the manufacturing of more than one product on the same machine line, without any affects upon or side effects in patients. The risk assessment of cross contamination is affected by many factors, related to either the patients taking the pharmaceutical products or the pharmaceutical product itself.Factors related to patients include those that might alter the individual's responses toward active pharmaceutical products; for instance, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) liver enzyme family is responsible for the breakdown of more than 30 different classes of drugs. Patients having less active or inactive forms of CYP enzymes cannot metabolize or eliminate certain drugs, leading to accumulation and increased toxicity of those drugs. Aging also affects the metabolizing process of drugs. Other factors can affect an individual's response toward any drug, and these effects range from minor to major.The factors related to the facility or formulation itself also have a major impact on the determination of maximum allowed carryover between two products; for instance, a potentially carcinogenic active pharmaceutical ingredient must have a lower accepted carryover than a noncarcinogenic one. Smaller batch size poses a larger threat when the batch is contaminated with the same amount of contaminant as a larger batch, and a large surface area machine train poses a larger risk for contamination.",

Acceptance criteria aid in the identification, on the one hand, of materials with unacceptable characteristics that should not pass the tests and procedures or, on the other hand, of unusual characteristics that indicate materials that are unlikely to pass the tests and procedures. For relatively complex procedures metrological approaches can differentiate between intra- and inter-laboratory variation and clarify unacceptable and unusual data. Such testing requires collaborative studies in which each participating laboratory essentially compares itself to the other laboratories in the collaborative study. Laboratories that use the reference standard established by the collaborative study are conducting a performance verification test in which they compare their capabilities to those of laboratories in the collaborative study. This paper considers aspects of a series of complex issues involving unacceptable/unusual characteristics primarily in the context of USP's work but with implications for manufacturing science via considerations of process capability and Quality by Design and to measurement science. Ultimately, acceptance criteria support the availability of good quality, safe, and effective medicines for patients and consumers.",

This review describes the elements, different design and tools of QbD as well as multidimensional applications of QbD ranging from dosage form and method development to meeting latest regulatory requirements. The understanding of a process is facilitated by proper identification of sources of variation, management of variability by process design, and prediction of product quality attributes using design space. The pharmaceutical industry is rapidly adopting the QbD principles for fabrication of safe, effective and quality products; however, we are still on a journey and the process of gathering all experience and metrics required for connecting and demonstrating QbD benefits to all stakeholders is still in progress.

Chemical alternatives assessment is defined as a process for identifying, comparing, and selecting safer alternatives to chemicals of concern (including those in materials, processes, or technologies) on the basis of their hazards, performance, and economic viability. The process is intended to provide guidance for assuring that chemicals of concern are replaced with safer alternatives that are not likely to be later regretted. Conceptually, the assessment methods are developed from a set of three foundational pillars and five common principles. Based on a number of emerging alternatives assessment initiatives, in this commentary, we outline a chemical alternatives assessment blueprint structured around three broad steps: Scope, Assessment, and Selection and Implementation. Specific tasks and tools are identified for each of these three steps. While it is recognized that on-going practice will further refine and develop the method and tools, it is important that the structure of the assessment process remain flexible, adaptive, and focused on the substitution of chemicals of concern with safer alternatives.

One of the main characteristics of UVCBs is that they have no unique representation. Industry scientists who are part of the scientific community have been working with academics and consultants to address the problem of a lack of a defined structural description. It has been acknowledged that one of the obstacles is the large number of possible structural isomers. We have recently proposed and published a methodology, based on the generic substance identifiers, to address this issue. The methodology allows for the coding of constituents, their generation, calculation of important characteristics of UVCB constituents, and selection of representative constituents. In the present study we introduce a statistical selection of the minimum number of generated constituents representing a UVCB. This representative sample was selected in such a way that the structural variability and the properties of concern of the UVCB were approximated within a predefined tolerable error. The aim of the statistical selection was to enable the assessment of UVCB substances by decreasing the number of constituents that need to be evaluated. The procedure, which was shown to be endpoint-independent, was validated theoretically and on real case studies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2019;38:682-694. © 2019 SETAC.",

CPCat was created by combining multiple and diverse sources of data on consumer- and industrial-process based chemical uses from regulatory agencies, manufacturers, and retailers in various countries. The database uses a controlled vocabulary of 833 terms and a novel nomenclature to capture and streamline descriptors of chemical use for 43,596 chemicals from the various sources. Examples of potential applications of CPCat are provided, including identifying chemicals to which children may be exposed and to support prioritization of chemicals for toxicity screening. CPCat is expected to be a valuable resource for regulators, risk assessors, and exposure scientists to identify potential sources of human exposures and exposure pathways, particularly for use in high-throughput chemical exposure assessment.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

However, what exactly does one mean by 'diversity' and why is it important? How can diversity be incorporated into compound collections and what are the theoretical and technical challenges this poses? In this editorial, we comment on various factors involved in the creation of structurally, and most crucially, functionally diverse compound libraries. In particular, we highlight the central role played by organic synthesis and discuss the value of diversity-driven synthetic approaches in the search for new biologically active molecules with potentially exciting and unusual biological properties.",

Many physical, chemical and biological data have been predicted from structural data. For the early phases of drug design, methods have been developed that are used in all major pharmaceutical companies. However, all domains of chemistry can benefit from chemoinformatics methods; many areas that are not yet well developed, but could substantially gain from the use of chemoinformatics methods. The quality of data is of crucial importance for successful results. Computer-assisted structure elucidation and computer-assisted synthesis design have been attempted in the early years of chemoinformatics. Because of the importance of these fields to the chemist, new approaches should be made with better hardware and software techniques. Society's concern about the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment could be met by the development of methods for toxicity prediction and risk assessment. In conjunction with bioinformatics, our understanding of the events in living organisms could be deepened and, thus, novel strategies for curing diseases developed.

This is due, at least in part, to a widespread failure to recognize that its greatest value may be conceptual rather than numerical, i.e., in achieving insight into molecular properties and behavior. In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

However, it is little-used because it has been considered to be subjective, and to be computationally very intensive. A simple computational method has been known for at least 30 years, but has been dismissed as an approximation. We show here that all three criticisms are misplaced. The method should be used to complement and augment all least-squares fitting, because it can give very different, and better outcomes than classical methods. It can discriminate between models with equal numbers of parameters and equally good fits to data. It quantifies the Occam's Razor injunction against over-fitting, and it demands that physically-meaningful parameters rejected by classical significance testing be included in the fitting, to avoid spurious precision and incorrect values for the other parameters. It strongly discourages the use of physically-meaningless parameters, thereby satisfying the Occam's Razor injunction to use existing entities for explanation rather than multiplying new ones. More generally, as a relative probability, the Bayes factor combines naturally with other quantitative information to guide action in the absence of certain knowledge.",

Tucker , however, did not succeed in obtaining a least-squares solution for his model. We derive in this paper a necessary condition for a least-squares solution and construct an algorithm which improves any given initial solution in the least-squares sense. We show that this algorithm converges to a representation satisfying the necessary conditions for a least-squares solution. The method is in no way restricted to three dimensions, but can be applied to any multimodal data array.",

The scale is closely related to (yet different from) L. C. Allen's, which is based on configuration energies. Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others. Outliers in agreement with other scales are oxygen and fluorine, now somewhat less electronegative, but in better agreement with their chemistry with the noble gas elements. Group 11 and 12 electronegativities emerge as high, although Au less so than in other scales. Our scale also gives relatively high electronegativities for Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Tc, Cd, Hg (affected by choice of valence state), and Gd. The new electronegativities provide hints for new alloy/compound design, and a framework is in place to analyze those energy changes in reactions in which electronegativity changes may not be controlling.",

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

A presumed one-to-one combination of atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton to construct his first table of relative atomic weights from literature analyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binary compounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theory as an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compounds of the form AB2, however, atomic theory made quantitative predictions that were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory required that the weight of B in the compound AB2 be exactly twice that in the compound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston all published within a few years of each other experimental data that claimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. There are nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desired integral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replication experiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results are experimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explains why Wollaston's experiments were so influential. ",

Improvements on the original ccCA formalism include replacing the small basis set quadratic configuration interaction computation with a coupled cluster computation, employing a correction for scalar relativistic effects, utilizing the tight-d forms of the second-row correlation-consistent basis sets, and revisiting the basis set chosen for geometry optimization. With two types of complete basis set extrapolation of MP2 energies, ccCA results in an almost zero mean deviation for the G3/99 set (with a best value of -0.10 kcal mol(-1)), and a 0.96 kcal mol(-1) mean absolute deviation, which is equivalent to the accuracy of the G3X model chemistry. There are no optimized or empirical parameters included in the computation of ccCA energies.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, χ̅, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. χ̅ has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

Polarizability, a physical property, is an inverse measure of resistance to deformation and thus should be inversely related to hardness. This is indeed generally accepted. Hardness has been postulated to be the second derivative of a system's energy with respect to its number of electrons, despite the fact that this involves the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. This second derivative is typically approximated as the difference between the ionization energy I and the electron affinity A of the ground-state system, which results in ambiguity in that many molecules do not form stable negative ions. For atoms, the quantity I - A does vary approximately inversely with polarizability, but this is only because the electron affinity is usually relatively low and ionization energy is known to be inversely related to polarizability for atoms. However, molecular polarizability depends primarily upon volume, and so does not show an acceptable inverse correlation with I - A. Since both hardness and polarizability refer to the same property of a system-its resistance to deformation of the electronic density, we propose that the reciprocal of polarizability be taken to be a measure of hardness. We show that polarizabilities that are not known can be estimated quite accurately in terms of the average local ionization energies on the atomic or molecular surfaces and, for molecules, their volumes.",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others.

Several hypotheses have been put forward, and the code has been analyzed extensively by authors looking for clues to selection pressures that might have acted during its evolution. But this approach has been ineffective. Although an impressive number of properties has been attributed to the universal code, it has been impossible to determine whether selection on any of these properties was important in the code's evolution or whether the observed properties arose as a consequence of selection on some other characteristic. Therefore we turned the question around and asked, what would a genetic code look like if it had evolved in response to various different selection pressures? To address this question, we constructed a genetic algorithm. We found first that selecting on a particular measure yields codes that are similar to each other. Second, we found that the universal code is far from minimized with respect to the effects of mutations (or translation errors) on the amino acid compositions of proteins. Finally, we found that the codes that most closely resembled real codes were those generated by selecting on aspects of the code's structure, not those generated by selecting to minimize the effects of amino acid substitutions on proteins. This suggests that the universal genetic code has been selected for a particular structure-a structure that confers an important flexibility on the evolution of genes and proteins-and that the particular assignments of amino acids to codons are secondary.",

As a result the search proceeds in parallel along a number of routes and is unlikely to get trapped in local optima. An important innovation of the algorithm is introduction of a constraint to let the starting points always keep a certain distance from each other so that the search is able to cover a larger region of space effectively. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it has more chances to find the global optimum and as many local optima as possible in a single run.

These atom-economical reactions transform ubiquitous C-H bonds under mild conditions to more complex structures with a high level of regiochemical and stereochemical control.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

It requires careful handling and special techniques for crystallisation, but the efforts seem to be rewarding when attaining co-crystals with small molecules as partners. Many basic questions such as the dominance of specific heterogeneous intermolecular interactions, their driving force for the formation of multicomponent crystals instead of neat ones are expected to be easily analysed. The underlying packing patterns and resulting stoichiometries based on the known supramolecular synthons seem to be straightforward for such small molecules and crystal engineering, considered as the prototype of supramolecular synthesis, should be a simple task. Nineteen co-crystals with acetylene are presented in this paper, some of which have been previously reported individually. An attempt has been made to find features shared by the groups of co-crystals, including those that could not be co-crystallised. But in spite of clear ideas and experiences from previous experiments, surprisingly almost none of systems reached our expectations. Our intuitive approach was not fulfilled, which demonstrates that multicomponent crystals even of small molecules will remain a great challenge for theoretical methods and the crystal structures shown herein represent good candidates for future testing. On the other hand, we wish to encourage other groups to present their views on the crystal structures with an unbiased approach that may offer a better explanation than we are able to outline in this article.",

Many physical, chemical and biological data have been predicted from structural data. For the early phases of drug design, methods have been developed that are used in all major pharmaceutical companies. However, all domains of chemistry can benefit from chemoinformatics methods; many areas that are not yet well developed, but could substantially gain from the use of chemoinformatics methods. The quality of data is of crucial importance for successful results. Computer-assisted structure elucidation and computer-assisted synthesis design have been attempted in the early years of chemoinformatics. Because of the importance of these fields to the chemist, new approaches should be made with better hardware and software techniques. Society's concern about the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment could be met by the development of methods for toxicity prediction and risk assessment. In conjunction with bioinformatics, our understanding of the events in living organisms could be deepened and, thus, novel strategies for curing diseases developed.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Both manual and automatic devices have been described. Some features that contribute to its popularity include: it produces all possible structural combinations of the monomers, it has outstanding productivity, it leads to the formation of individual compounds in nearly equimolar quantities (affected by statistics and incomplete reactions), and it can be applied to all classes of organic compounds. Since an enormously large number of compounds can be produced in principle in a relatively short time, some practical considerations are discussed that can be useful in library design. Encoding organic libraries by peptide or nucleotide sequences or with binary tags are also described together with methods for tagging macroscopic support units with electronic chips, two dimensional bar codes or colored resin and capsule caps.

With modern scientific capabilities it has become possible to create synthetic molecular devices and interface them with each other. Countless such machines exist in nature, and it is possible to build artificial ones by mimicking nature. Here we review some of the known molecular machines, their structures, features, and characteristics. We also look at certain devices in their early development stages, as well as their future applications and challenges.",

The field has evolved in the past 50 years and has substantially shaped how chemical research is performed by providing access to chemical information on a scale unattainable by traditional methods. Many physical, chemical and biological data have been predicted from structural data. For the early phases of drug design, methods have been developed that are used in all major pharmaceutical companies. However, all domains of chemistry can benefit from chemoinformatics methods; many areas that are not yet well developed, but could substantially gain from the use of chemoinformatics methods. The quality of data is of crucial importance for successful results. Computer-assisted structure elucidation and computer-assisted synthesis design have been attempted in the early years of chemoinformatics. Because of the importance of these fields to the chemist, new approaches should be made with better hardware and software techniques. Society's concern about the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment could be met by the development of methods for toxicity prediction and risk assessment. In conjunction with bioinformatics, our understanding of the events in living organisms could be deepened and, thus, novel strategies for curing diseases developed. With so many challenging tasks awaiting solutions, the future is bright for chemoinformatics. ",

The library implements a wide variety of cheminformatics algorithms ranging from chemical structure canonicalization to molecular descriptor calculations and pharmacophore perception. It is used in drug discovery, metabolomics, and toxicology. Over the last 10 years, the code base has grown significantly, however, resulting in many complex interdependencies among components and poor performance of many algorithms.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The generation of a C-O bond at the expense of a C-H bond during this process may be considered the most basic form of C-H functionalization. This illustrates the extreme generality of the term \"C-H functionalization\", because it can describe the conversion of literally any C-H bond into a C-X bond (X being anything except H). Therefore, it may be of use to distinguish between what, in our view, are two distinct categories of C-H functionalization logic: \"guided\" and \"innate\". Guided C-H functionalizations, as the name implies, are guided by external reagents or directing groups (covalently or fleetingly bound) to install new functional groups at the expense of specifically targeted C-H bonds. Conversely, innate C-H functionalizations may be broadly defined as reactions that exchange C-H bonds for new functional groups based solely on natural reactivity patterns in the absence of other directing forces.  Two substrates that illustrate this distinction are dihydrojunenol and isonicotinic acid. The C-H functionalization processes of hydroxylation or arylation, respectively, can take place at multiple locations on each molecule. Innate functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are dictated by the inherent bias (steric or electronic) of the substrate undergoing C-H cleavage, whereas guided functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are controlled by external directing forces such as metal complexation or steric bias of the reagent. Although the distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalizations may not always be clear in cases that do not fit neatly into a single category, it is a useful convention to consider when analyzing reactivity patterns and strategies for synthesis. We must emphasize that although a completely rigorous distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalization may not be practical, we have nonetheless found it to be a useful tool at the planning stage of synthesis.  In this Account, we trace our own studies in the area of C-H functionalization in synthesis through the lens of \"guided\" and \"innate\" descriptors. We show how harnessing innate reactivity can be beneficial for achieving unique bond constructions between heterocycles and carbonyl compounds, enabling rapid and scalable total syntheses. Guided and innate functionalizations were used synergistically to create an entire family of terpenes in a controlled fashion. We continue with a discussion of the synthesis of complex alkaloids with high nitrogen content, which required the invention of a uniquely chemoselective innate C-H functionalization protocol. These findings led us to develop a series of innate C-H functionalization reactions for forging C-C bonds of interest to the largest body of practicing organic chemists: medicinal chemists. Strategic use of C-H functionalization logic can have a dramatically positive effect on the efficiency of synthesis, whether guided or innate.",

An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory.

It is found that the presence of CA favors the formation of those condensation compounds that may be expected to present the strongest binding to the CA active site. The virtual combinatorial library approach may represent a powerful methodology for the discovery of substrates, inhibitors, receptors, catalysts, and carriers for a variety of processes.",

For different compound data sets, varying numbers of frequently occurring data set-dependent transformations were identified that consistently induced favorable changes of selected molecular properties. Sequences of compound pairs representing such transformations were determined that formed pathways leading from unfavorable to favorable regions of property space. Data set-dependent transformations were then applied to predict a series of compounds with increasingly favorable property values. By database searching the desired biological activity was detected for several designed molecules or compounds that were very similar to these molecules. Taken together our findings indicate that data set-dependent transformations can be applied to predict compounds that map to favorable regions of molecular property space and retain their biological activity.

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

For example, drawing positive and negative electrostatic isopotential surfaces partitions the molecule into regions subject to nucleophilic or electrophilic attack. Similarly, coloring isodensity surfaces to indicate the magnitude of the gradient of the electron density maps the molecule surface into regions of high and low electronegativity. A basic understanding of reaction mechanisms can also come from viewing and manipulating isovalued surfaces. A theory of molecular interactions, based upon second-order perturbation theory, provides for the decomposition of the intermolecular interaction energy into steric, electrostatic and orbital interactions. Color figures illustrate the docking of reactant molecular densities, electrostatic potentials and orbitals on low-energy pathways. The figures are used to visualize the steric, electrostatic and orbital contributions to molecular interaction energy. The visualization not only identifies low-energy reaction pathways, but it frequently reveals local interactions which determine the magnitude of the total interaction energy. Similar insight is not easily obtained by simple evaluation of the total interaction energy. Approximate transition states, built from structures along low-energy approach pathways, are excellent starting points for transition state searches.",

However, semiempirical molecular orbital models still are of limited accuracy and need to be improved if the full potential of new linear scaling techniques, such as MOZYME and LocalSCF, is to be realized. Accordingly, in this article we present RM1 (Recife Model 1): a reparameterization of AM1. As before, the properties used in the parameterization procedure were: heats of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials and geometric variables (bond lengths and angles). Considering that the vast majority of molecules of importance to life can be assembled by using only six elements: C, H, N, O, P, and S, and that by adding the halogens we can now build most molecules of importance to pharmaceutical research, our training set consisted of 1736 molecules, representative of organic and biochemistry, containing C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I atoms. Unlike AM1, and similar to PM3, all RM1 parameters have been optimized. For enthalpies of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials, and interatomic distances, the average errors in RM1, for the 1736 molecules, are less than those for AM1, PM3, and PM5. Indeed, the average errors in kcal x mol(-1) of the enthalpies of formation for AM1, PM3, and PM5 are 11.15, 7.98, and 6.03, whereas for RM1 this value is 5.77. The errors, in Debye, of the dipole moments for AM1, PM3, PM5, and RM1 are, respectively, 0.37, 0.38, 0.50, and 0.34. Likewise, the respective errors for the ionization potentials, in eV, are 0.60, 0.55, 0.48, and 0.45, and the respective errors, in angstroms, for the interatomic distances are 0.036, 0.029, 0.037, and 0.027. The RM1 average error in bond angles of 6.82 degrees is only slightly higher than the AM1 figure of 5.88 degrees, and both are much smaller than the PM3 and PM5 figures of 6.98 degrees and 9.83 degrees, respectively. Moreover, a known error in PM3 nitrogen charges is corrected in RM1. Therefore, RM1 represents an improvement over AM1 and its similar successor PM3, and is probably very competitive with PM5, which is a somewhat different model, and not fully disclosed. RM1 possesses the same analytical construct and the same number of parameters for each atom as AM1, and, therefore, can be easily implemented in any software that already has AM1, not requiring any change in any line of code, with the sole exception of the values of the parameters themselves.",

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Input-output relations tend to follow a few regular patterns. For example, many chemical processes follow the S-shaped Hill equation relation between input concentrations and output concentrations. That Hill equation pattern contradicts the fundamental Michaelis-Menten theory of enzyme kinetics. I use the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those components combine to determine the system's overall input-output relations. That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology. Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours. Natural selection may act primarily to modulate system properties within those broad constraints.",

A presumed one-to-one combination of atoms A and B to form a simple compound AB allowed Dalton to construct his first table of relative atomic weights from literature analyses of appropriate binary compounds. For such simple binary compounds, the atomic theory had little advantages over affinity theory as an explanation of fixed proportions by weight. For ternary compounds of the form AB2, however, atomic theory made quantitative predictions that were not deducible from affinity theory. Atomic theory required that the weight of B in the compound AB2 be exactly twice that in the compound AB. Dalton, Thomas Thomson and William Hyde Wollaston all published within a few years of each other experimental data that claimed to give the predicted results with the required accuracy. There are nonetheless several experimental barriers to obtaining the desired integral multiple proportions. In this paper I will discuss replication experiments which demonstrate that only Wollaston's results are experimentally reliable. It is likely that such replicability explains why Wollaston's experiments were so influential. ",

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

The key challenge that we formulate in this contribution is to understand how genetic information and external factors combine to create an organism, and conversely how the genome has learned in the course of evolution how to harness the environment, and analogously how coding, regulation and spatial organization interact in cellular processes.",

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)]. In this work, a historical but contemporary perspective of the discoveries and innovations of the two reactions is given. From a bird's eye view and in a more general sense, the discovery of novel reactions is discussed and how it relates to inventions and innovations.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Lewis recognized that acids are not restricted to those substances that contain hydrogen (Brønsted acids), and helped overthrow the \"modern cult of the proton\". His discovery ushered in the use of Lewis acids as reagents and catalysts for organic reactions. However, in recent years, the recognition that Lewis bases can also serve in this capacity has grown enormously. Most importantly, it has become increasingly apparent that the behavior of Lewis bases as agents for promoting chemical reactions is not merely as an electronic complement of the cognate Lewis acids: in fact Lewis bases are capable of enhancing both the electrophilic and nucleophilic character of molecules to which they are bound.

The generation of a C-O bond at the expense of a C-H bond during this process may be considered the most basic form of C-H functionalization. This illustrates the extreme generality of the term \"C-H functionalization\", because it can describe the conversion of literally any C-H bond into a C-X bond (X being anything except H). Therefore, it may be of use to distinguish between what, in our view, are two distinct categories of C-H functionalization logic: \"guided\" and \"innate\". Guided C-H functionalizations, as the name implies, are guided by external reagents or directing groups (covalently or fleetingly bound) to install new functional groups at the expense of specifically targeted C-H bonds. Conversely, innate C-H functionalizations may be broadly defined as reactions that exchange C-H bonds for new functional groups based solely on natural reactivity patterns in the absence of other directing forces.  Two substrates that illustrate this distinction are dihydrojunenol and isonicotinic acid. The C-H functionalization processes of hydroxylation or arylation, respectively, can take place at multiple locations on each molecule. Innate functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are dictated by the inherent bias (steric or electronic) of the substrate undergoing C-H cleavage, whereas guided functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are controlled by external directing forces such as metal complexation or steric bias of the reagent. Although the distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalizations may not always be clear in cases that do not fit neatly into a single category, it is a useful convention to consider when analyzing reactivity patterns and strategies for synthesis. We must emphasize that although a completely rigorous distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalization may not be practical, we have nonetheless found it to be a useful tool at the planning stage of synthesis.  In this Account, we trace our own studies in the area of C-H functionalization in synthesis through the lens of \"guided\" and \"innate\" descriptors. We show how harnessing innate reactivity can be beneficial for achieving unique bond constructions between heterocycles and carbonyl compounds, enabling rapid and scalable total syntheses. Guided and innate functionalizations were used synergistically to create an entire family of terpenes in a controlled fashion. We continue with a discussion of the synthesis of complex alkaloids with high nitrogen content, which required the invention of a uniquely chemoselective innate C-H functionalization protocol. These findings led us to develop a series of innate C-H functionalization reactions for forging C-C bonds of interest to the largest body of practicing organic chemists: medicinal chemists. Strategic use of C-H functionalization logic can have a dramatically positive effect on the efficiency of synthesis, whether guided or innate.",

Historically, however, only a handful of bacteria have attained the acceptance and widespread use that are needed to fulfil the needs of industrial bioproduction - and only for the synthesis of very few, structurally simple compounds. One of the reasons for this unfortunate circumstance has been the dearth of tools for targeted genome engineering of bacterial chassis, and, nowadays, synthetic biology is significantly helping to bridge such knowledge gap. Against this background, in this review, we discuss the state of the art in the rational design and construction of robust bacterial chassis for metabolic engineering, presenting key examples of bacterial species that have secured a place in industrial bioproduction. The emergence of novel bacterial chassis is also considered at the light of the unique properties of their physiology and metabolism, and the practical applications in which they are expected to outperform other microbial platforms. Emerging opportunities, essential strategies to enable successful development of industrial phenotypes, and major challenges in the field of bacterial chassis development are also discussed, outlining the solutions that contemporary synthetic biology-guided metabolic engineering offers to tackle these issues.",

It works largely as flavour and fragrance. Since some bacteria were found to be capable of vigorous acetoin biosynthesis from versatile renewable biomass, acetoin, like its reduced form 2,3-butanediol, was also classified as a promising bio-based platform chemical. In spite of several reviews on the biological production of 2,3-butanediol, little has concentrated on acetoin. The two analogous compounds are present in the same acetoin (or 2,3-butanediol) pathway, but their production processes including optimal strains, substrates, derivatives, process controls and product recovery methods are quite different. In this review, the usages of acetoin are reviewed firstly to demonstrate its importance. The biosynthesis pathway and molecular regulation mechanisms are then outlined to depict the principal network of functioning in typical species. A phylogenetic tree is constructed and the relationship between taxonomy and acetoin producing ability is revealed for the first time, which will serve as a useful guide for the screening of competitive acetoin producers. Genetic engineering, medium optimization, and process control are effective strategies to improve productivity as well. Currently, downstream processing is one of the main barriers in efficient and economical industrial acetoin fermentation. The future prospects of microbial acetoin production are discussed in light of the current progress, challenges, and trends in this field. ",

CCTCC M209061 cells for anti-Prelog reduction of prochiral ketones.\nChiral alcohols are widely used in the synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals, flavors and functional materials and appropriate whole-cell biocatalysts offer a highly enantioselective, minimally polluting route to these valuable compounds. The recently isolated strain Acetobacter sp. CCTCC M209061 showed exclusive anti-Prelog stereoselectivity for the reduction of prochiral ketones, but the low biomass has limited its commercialization and industrial applications. To tackle this problem, the effects of medium components and culture conditions on the strain's growth and reduction activity were explored. By using a one-at-a-time method and a central composite rotatable design (CCRD), the optimal medium and culture conditions were found to be as follows: glucose 8.26 g/L, fructose 2.50 g/L, soy peptone 83.92 g/L, MnSO4·H2O 0.088 g/L, pH 5.70, 30°C and 10% (v/v) inoculum. Under the above-mentioned conditions, the biomass after 30 h cultivation reached 1.10 ± 0.03 g/L, which was 9.5-fold higher than that obtained with basic medium. Also, the reduction activity towards 4'-chloroacetophenone was markedly enhanced to 39.49 ± 0.96 μmol/min/g from 29.34 ± 0.65 μmol/min/g, with the product e.e. being above 99%. Comparable improvements were also seen with the enantioselective bioreduction of 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-2-one to the key pharmaceutical precursor (R) - 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-2-ol. The biomass and reduction activity of Acetobacter sp. CCTCC M209061 can be greatly enhanced through the optimization strategy. This facilitates use of the strain in the anti-Prelog stereoselective reduction of prochiral ketones to enantiopure chiral alcohols as building blocks for many industries.",

First, many enzymes were not accessible in large enough quantities for practical applications. The advent of recombinant DNA technology changed this dramatically in the late 1970s. Second, many enzymes showed a narrow substrate scope, often poor stereo- and/or regioselectivity and/or insufficient stability under operating conditions. With the development of directed evolution beginning in the 1990s and continuing to the present day, all of these problems can be addressed and generally solved. The present Perspective focuses on these and other developments which have popularized enzymes as part of the toolkit of synthetic organic chemists and biotechnologists. Included is a discussion of the scope and limitation of cascade reactions using enzyme mixtures in vitro and of metabolic engineering of pathways in cells as factories for the production of simple compounds such as biofuels and complex natural products.

The Saariselkä agreement revisited.\nMany biological or chemical agents when combined interact with each other and produce a synergistic response that cannot be predicted based on the single agent responses alone. However, depending on the postulated null hypothesis of non-interaction, one may end up in different interpretations of synergy. Two popular reference models for null hypothesis include the Bliss independence model and the Loewe additivity model, each of which is formulated from different perspectives. During the last century, there has been an intensive debate on the suitability of these synergy models, both of which are theoretically justified and also in practice supported by different schools of scientists. More than 20 years ago, there was a community effort to make a consensus on the terminology one should use when claiming synergy. The agreement was formulated at a conference held in Saariselkä, Finland in 1992, stating that one should use the terms Bliss synergy or Loewe synergy to avoid ambiguity in the underlying models. We review the theoretical relationships between these models and argue that one should combine the advantages of both models to provide a more consistent definition of synergy and antagonism. ",

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Also provided are the thermochemical consequences of functional group replacements, in which one group in a molecule is substituted by another, thus providing quick short cuts to estimating new Δ(f)H(0) values.

The energetic criterion is based on resonance energy and aromatic stabilization energy, whereas harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity-on molecular geometry. Magnetism-based criteria are illustrated by local indicators (for individual rings): nucleus independent chemical shifts and proton nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts as well as the global aromaticity index-exaltation of the magnetic susceptibility.

With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

The present state and utility of the Benson additivity schemes for estimating the enthalpy of formation (Δ(f)H(0)) of organic compounds are again described, extending them to include more elements. Old and new GAVs for a wide variety of compounds are provided and are revised where necessary. When new terms are proposed, or old ones are significantly altered, the rationale for so doing is presented. GAV derived ring strain values for benzene and pyridine indicate that the aromatic stabilization of each is essentially the same.

However, semiempirical molecular orbital models still are of limited accuracy and need to be improved if the full potential of new linear scaling techniques, such as MOZYME and LocalSCF, is to be realized. Accordingly, in this article we present RM1 (Recife Model 1): a reparameterization of AM1. As before, the properties used in the parameterization procedure were: heats of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials and geometric variables (bond lengths and angles). Considering that the vast majority of molecules of importance to life can be assembled by using only six elements: C, H, N, O, P, and S, and that by adding the halogens we can now build most molecules of importance to pharmaceutical research, our training set consisted of 1736 molecules, representative of organic and biochemistry, containing C, H, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, and I atoms. Unlike AM1, and similar to PM3, all RM1 parameters have been optimized. For enthalpies of formation, dipole moments, ionization potentials, and interatomic distances, the average errors in RM1, for the 1736 molecules, are less than those for AM1, PM3, and PM5. Indeed, the average errors in kcal x mol(-1) of the enthalpies of formation for AM1, PM3, and PM5 are 11.15, 7.98, and 6.03, whereas for RM1 this value is 5.77. The errors, in Debye, of the dipole moments for AM1, PM3, PM5, and RM1 are, respectively, 0.37, 0.38, 0.50, and 0.34. Likewise, the respective errors for the ionization potentials, in eV, are 0.60, 0.55, 0.48, and 0.45, and the respective errors, in angstroms, for the interatomic distances are 0.036, 0.029, 0.037, and 0.027. The RM1 average error in bond angles of 6.82 degrees is only slightly higher than the AM1 figure of 5.88 degrees, and both are much smaller than the PM3 and PM5 figures of 6.98 degrees and 9.83 degrees, respectively. Moreover, a known error in PM3 nitrogen charges is corrected in RM1. Therefore, RM1 represents an improvement over AM1 and its similar successor PM3, and is probably very competitive with PM5, which is a somewhat different model, and not fully disclosed. RM1 possesses the same analytical construct and the same number of parameters for each atom as AM1, and, therefore, can be easily implemented in any software that already has AM1, not requiring any change in any line of code, with the sole exception of the values of the parameters themselves.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In doing so we look at a particular approach that each field has adopted and how information theory has informed the development of the ideas of each field. A key theme is expected utility theory, its connection to information theory, the Bayesian approach to decision-making and forms of (bounded) rationality. What emerges from this review is a broadly unified formal perspective derived from three very different starting points that reflect the unique principles of each field. Each of the three approaches reviewed can, in principle at least, be implemented in a computational model in such a way that, with sufficient computational power, they could be compared with human abilities in complex tasks. However, a central critique that can be applied to all three approaches was first put forward by Savage in <iThe Foundations of Statistics</i and recently brought to the fore by the economist Binmore: Bayesian approaches to decision-making work in what Savage called 'small worlds' but cannot work in 'large worlds'. This point, in various different guises, is central to some of the current debates about the power of artificial intelligence and its relationship to human-like learning and decision-making. Recent work on artificial intelligence has gone some way to bridging this gap but significant questions remain to be answered in all three fields in order to make progress in producing realistic models of human decision-making in the real world in which we live in.",

By using the cognitive and decision sciences as a case study, we provide an introduction to what is also known as the strategy selection problem. First, we explain why many researchers assume humans and other animals to come equipped with a repertoire of behavioral and cognitive processes. Second, we expose three descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive challenges that are common to all disciplines which aim to model the choice among these processes. Third, we give an overview of different approaches to strategy selection. These include cost-benefit, ecological, learning, memory, unified, connectionist, sequential sampling, and maximization approaches. We conclude by pointing to opportunities for future research and by stressing that the selection problem is far from being resolved.

Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model.

By drawing upon the concept known as the variational free energy principle, the paper will explore how this principle can be used to temper rational choice theory by re-formulating how agents optimize. The approach will result in agent behavior that encompasses a wide range of so-called cognitive biases, as seen in the scientific literature of behavioral economics, but instead of using these biases as further indications of market inefficiencies or market failures, the paper will likewise attempt to show the limits to which these biases can inform or critique standard economic theory. The paper therefore offers up a \"middle of the road\" approach, in which the neoclassical agent is not quite as \"rational\" as rational choice theory assumes, but at the same time, not quite as irrational as behavioral economics would often have us believe.",

The moment of inertia, determined directly from microwave spectroscopy measurements, serves to illustrate the mechanism through which MACE evaluations merge experimental and quantum chemical modeling. MACE results reported combine gradient descent optimization of each ab initio agent with an agent that predicts the chemical structure based on root-mean-square deviation of the predicted inertia tensor with experimentally measured moments of inertia. Successful model fusion for several small molecules was achieved as well as the larger molecule solketal.

We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.",

A simple computational method has been known for at least 30 years, but has been dismissed as an approximation. We show here that all three criticisms are misplaced. The method should be used to complement and augment all least-squares fitting, because it can give very different, and better outcomes than classical methods. It can discriminate between models with equal numbers of parameters and equally good fits to data. It quantifies the Occam's Razor injunction against over-fitting, and it demands that physically-meaningful parameters rejected by classical significance testing be included in the fitting, to avoid spurious precision and incorrect values for the other parameters. It strongly discourages the use of physically-meaningless parameters, thereby satisfying the Occam's Razor injunction to use existing entities for explanation rather than multiplying new ones.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

His synthetic and mechanistic studies have contributed to areas including non-benzenoid aromatics, carbenes, pericyclic reactions, and diradical intermediates. Doering's synthesis with L. H. Knox of the highly stable tropylium ion and their investigation of its reactivity were the starting point for the development of the field of non-benzenoid aromatics. Working with A. K. Hoffmann, Doering demonstrated the synthesis of dichloro- and dibromocarbene by base-induced alpha elimination of HCl or HBr from CHCl3 or CHBr3 under anhydrous conditions. These results allowed for the synthesis of a variety of cyclopropanes and derivatives including allenes. Using 14C labeling experiments, Doering and Prinzbach showed that the mechanism of insertion of singlet methylene into a C-H bond was a concerted process.In their work on the Cope rearrangement, Doering and Roth's outstanding stereochemical analysis showed that the rearrangement of acyclic 1,5-hexadienes proceeds concertedly, passing over a chairlike transition state. This work has had an enormous impact on the understanding of stereochemical control in synthetic organic chemistry, and many fruitful applications in synthesis have stemmed directly from this finding. Transition-state resonance structures analogous to those for ground-state aromatics can qualitatively explain the relatively large substituent effects on the rate of the Cope rearrangement. However, quantum chemical calculations have quantitatively described these effects. The rapid degenerate Cope rearrangements in the cis-divinylcyclopropane units of 3,4-homotropilidene, barbaralone, and bullvalene establish these molecules as having fluxional structures. The unique molecule bullvalene has more than 1.2 million possible structures interconnected by degenerate Cope rearrangements, which average all H and all C atoms. Doering has also examined stepwise thermal reorganizations that pass through intermediary 1,3- or 1,4-diradicals and do not show conformational equilibration as would be expected for classical intermediates. Doering calls these processes \"not-obviously concerted\". He discusses \"continuous diradicals\" as transition states and rationalizes the course of these reactions through the concept of a \"caldera\" (a flat surface with small energy wells as found on the top of volcanoes).The understanding of fundamental chemical reactions remains the focus of Doering's research. In his terms, \"understanding\" means not only gaining deep insight but also the intellectual control that allows researchers to predict a reaction's course. Because the interplay between theory and experiment has led to great progress in this predictive ability, Doering's experimental work has provided an important input for computational chemistry and to the essential understanding of chemical reactions.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

This Perspective provides examples of such productive collaborations. The understanding of various reaction mechanisms and the insight gained from these studies are emphasized. The applications of various experimental techniques in elucidation of reaction details as well as the development of various computational techniques to meet the demand of emerging synthetic methods, e.g., C-H activation, organocatalysis, and single electron transfer, are presented along with some conventional developments of mechanistic aspects. Examples of applications are selected to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of these techniques. Some challenges in the mechanistic studies and predictions of reactions are also analyzed. ",

With new experiments, computational methods and routes to materials synthesis, we assess what Poisson's ratio means in the contemporary understanding of the mechanical characteristics of modern materials. Central to these recent advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the elastic limit between Poisson's ratio and densification, connectivity, ductility and the toughness of solids; and their association with the dynamic properties of the liquids from which they were condensed and into which they melt.",

It may be that in complex fields this is inevitable, for science invokes subtle abstractions which are necessarily concerned sequentially with parts rather than simultaneously with a whole system. But how enormously better off we are now than we were in 1900, for we at least now understand the physical principles behind most of the properties of ceramics and metals, and more than one practical achievement stems directly from a scientist's suggestion. No practical man now understands metals better than the solid-state physicist; this was certainly not true even as little as 20 years ago. Yet the likelihood that pure science will lead directly to the discovery of really new materials will be only slightly greater in the future than it was in the past unless methods for handling wholes can be developed that are precise enough to be called scientific and communicable enough to be taught. This is a task that the scientist has in the past rightly and profitably refused to accept. We need a supergenius to develop some principles, not of simple particles and their interactions, but of extremely complex structures with parts interacting with other parts, on all levels, and with a hierarchy of interpenetrating substructures combining to form many levels of interpenetrating superstructure (21).",

The questions were divided into 3 sections: general inquiries, questions for CAD/CAM users, and questions for nonusers. The questionnaire was randomly distributed to Austrian dentists via email and social media. A total of 115 responses were submitted. The vast majority of respondents, 52.6% (n = 60), practised as general dentists. Furthermore, a significant proportion of participants specialised in oral surgery, 17.5% (n = 20), and orthodontics, 12.3% (n = 14). Approximately half of the respondents, 51.8% (n = 59), reported having a CAD/CAM device at their current workplace. Amongst the CAD/CAM users, 70.7% (n = 58) believed that CAD/CAM is important in increasing the number of patients visiting the dental practice. In total, 54.2% (n = 26) of nonusers indicated the high initial cost of purchasing a CAD/CAM device as the main reason for not utilising this technology.

During these episodes France lost its scientific pre-eminence as paradigms switched from mathematical to observational, and accurate experiments became the prerequisite for scientific advance.

The adaptive features of organisms could now be explained, like the phenomena of the inanimate world, as the result of natural processes, without recourse to an Intelligent Designer. The Copernican and the Darwinian Revolutions may be seen as the two stages of the one Scientific Revolution. They jointly ushered in the beginning of science in the modern sense of the word: explanation through natural laws. Darwin's theory of natural selection accounts for the \"design\" of organisms, and for their wondrous diversity, as the result of natural processes, the gradual accumulation of spontaneously arisen variations (mutations) sorted out by natural selection. Which characteristics will be selected depends on which variations happen to be present at a given time in a given place. This in turn depends on the random process of mutation as well as on the previous history of the organisms. Mutation and selection have jointly driven the marvelous process that, starting from microscopic organisms, has yielded orchids, birds, and humans.

A literature inquiry in scientific and patent databases (WoS, Scopus, The Lens, Google Patents) pointed to 92 scientific publications and 212 patent documents. As a part of our own technological experiments, we have created several prototype products used in architectural interior design. Following the synthesis, these sources of knowledge can be concluded: 1. MBCs are inexpensive in production, ecological, and offer a high artistic value. Their weaknesses are insufficient load capacity, unfavourable water affinity, and unknown reliability. 2. The scientific literature shows that the material parameters of MBCs can be adjusted to certain needs, but there are almost infinite combinations: properties of the input biomaterials, characteristics of the fungi species, and possible parameters during the growth and subsequent processing of the MBCs. 3. The patent documents show the need for development: an effective method to increase the density and the search for technologies to obtain a more homogeneous internal structure of the composite material. 4. Our own experiments with the production of various everyday objects indicate that some disadvantages of MBCs can be considered advantages. Such an unexpected advantage is the interesting surface texture resulting from the natural inhomogeneity of the internal structure of MBCs, which can be controlled to some extent.",

The elastic constants, bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, and Poisson's ratio were obtained. These results indicate that CaAlSiN3 is mechanically stable and a relatively hard material. Moreover, this compound has an indirect band gap of ∼3.4 eV according to its band structure and density of states. The linear photon energy dependent dielectric functions and related optical properties including the refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption spectrum, reflectivity, and energy loss spectrum were computed and discussed. It is shown that no sizable anisotropy is found in the optical properties of CaAlSiN3. The obtained structural estimation and some other results are in agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. This investigation is not only helpful for better understanding the electronic, mechanical and optical properties of CaAlSiN3, but also will open up the possibility of its use in device applications.

In this paper, we propose an improved version of the AOA called nAOA algorithm, which uses the high-density values that the natural logarithm and exponential operators can generate, to enhance the exploratory ability of the AOA. The addition and subtraction operators carry out the exploitation. The candidate solutions are initialized using the beta distribution, and the random variables and adaptations used in the algorithm have beta distribution. We test the performance of the proposed nAOA with 30 benchmark functions (20 classical and 10 composite test functions) and three engineering design benchmarks. The performance of nAOA is compared with the original AOA and nine other state-of-the-art algorithms. The nAOA shows efficient performance for the benchmark functions and was second only to GWO for the welded beam design (WBD), compression spring design (CSD), and pressure vessel design (PVD).",

This paper aims to provide a framework for thinking about the four key questions in cellular material design: how to select a unit cell, how to vary cell size spatially, what the optimal parameters are, and finally, how best to integrate a cellular material within the structure at large. These questions are posed with the intent of stimulating further research that can address them individually, as well as integrate them in a systematic methodology for cellular material design.

However, it is argued in this paper that the very notion of self-assembly presents an incorrect and misleading one for the physical effects that it stands for. Self-assembly presents a misnomer as each self-assembly process not only depends on, but also includes a certain degree of ordering in the immediate surrounding of the 'self-assembling' entities. Claims are provided to support the idea that every self-assembly process is, in fact, a co-assembly event, as it implies mutual changes and structuring of both the 'self-assembled' system and its nearest surrounding. This point of view is related to the systemic observation that there could be no physical qualities independent on the context of their existence. In order to illustrate that the concept of co-assembly presents only an instance of a more profound and systemic philosophy of life, the examples of the interplay between internal and external factors of development are provided from the fields of quantum and classical physics, biology, evolutionary theory and psychology.",

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)]. In this work, a historical but contemporary perspective of the discoveries and innovations of the two reactions is given. From a bird's eye view and in a more general sense, the discovery of novel reactions is discussed and how it relates to inventions and innovations.",

We detail the different categories of autocatalyses, and compare them on the basis of their mechanistic, kinetic, and dynamic properties. It is shown how autocatalytic patterns can be generated by different systems of chemical reactions. The notion of autocatalysis covers a large variety of mechanistic realizations with very similar behaviors; it is proposed that its key signature is its kinetic pattern expressed in a mathematical form.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

P. Hammett's book of that title, although substantial earlier work can be traced back to the turn of the 20th century. Many of the instrumental tools that helped the discipline develop in so many different ways began to appear in the late thirties and during World War II and were soon built to be increasingly operated in the \"hands-on\" mode. This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were (14)C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of (19)F, (13)C, and (15)N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring Huckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists.

(3)He, (13)C, and (1)H NMR spectroscopic properties were then determined. A comparison of experimental chemical shifts against those computed using density functional theory (B3LYP) with polarized triple- and double-zeta basis sets for He and C,H, respectively, allowed provisional assignment of structure for several isomers to be made. Theoretical calculations have also been carried out to identify low-energy structures. The transfer hydrogenation method using dihydroanthracene gives a major C(60)H(36) isomer and a minor C(60)H(36) isomer with C(3) symmetry as determined by the (13)C NMR spectrum of C(60)H(36) and the (3)He NMR spectrum of the corresponding sample of (3)He@C(60)H(36). In view of the HPLC retention times and the (3)He chemical shifts observed for the Birch and dihydroanthracene reduction products, the two isomers generated by the latter procedure can be only minor isomers of the Birch reduction. A significant energy barrier apparently exists in the dihydroanthracene reduction of C(60) for the conversion of the C(3) and C(1) symmetry isomers of C(60)H(36) to the T symmetry isomer previously predicted by many calculations to be among the most stable C(60)H(36) isomers. Many of the (1)H NMR signals exhibited by C(60)H(36) (and C(60)H(18), previously reported) are unusually deshielded compared to \"ordinary\" organic compounds, presumably because the unusual structures of C(60)H(36) and C(60)H(18) result in chemical shift tensors with one or more unusual principal values. Calculations clearly show a relationship between exceptionally deshielded protons beta to a benzene ring in C(60)H(18) and C(60)H(36) and relatively long C-C bonds associated with these protons. The additional information obtained from 1D and 2D (1)H NMR spectra obtained at ultrahigh field strengths (up to 900 MHz) will serve as a critical test of chemical shifts to be obtained from future calculations on different C(60)H(36) isomers.",

The scale is closely related to (yet different from) L. C. Allen's, which is based on configuration energies. Using a combination of literature experimental values for ground-state energies and ab initio-calculated energies where experimental data are missing, we are able to provide electronegativities for elements 1-96. The values are slightly smaller than Allen's original scale, but correlate well with Allen's and others. Outliers in agreement with other scales are oxygen and fluorine, now somewhat less electronegative, but in better agreement with their chemistry with the noble gas elements. Group 11 and 12 electronegativities emerge as high, although Au less so than in other scales. Our scale also gives relatively high electronegativities for Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Tc, Cd, Hg (affected by choice of valence state), and Gd. The new electronegativities provide hints for new alloy/compound design, and a framework is in place to analyze those energy changes in reactions in which electronegativity changes may not be controlling.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

We consider the variation in stability between different categories of systems-hydrogen-bonded, halogen-bonded, and weakly bound cocrystals-finding that, contrary to chemical intuition, the presence of hydrogen or halogen bond interactions is not necessarily a good predictor of stability. Finally, we investigate the correlation of the relative stability with simple chemical descriptors: changes in packing efficiency and hydrogen bond strength. We find some broad qualitative agreement with chemical intuition-more densely packed cocrystals with stronger hydrogen bonding tend to be more stable-but the relationship is weak, suggesting that such simple descriptors do not capture the complex balance of interactions driving cocrystallization. Our conclusions suggest that while cocrystallization is often a thermodynamically favorable process, it remains difficult to formulate general rules to guide synthesis, highlighting the continued importance of high-level computation in predicting and rationalizing such systems.",

Recently, CCP4 introduced CCP4i2, a modern graphical interface designed to help structural biologists to navigate the process of structure determination, with an emphasis on pipelining and the streamlined presentation of results.

This is misleading: we do not wish to span the mesoscale, but to work at the appropriate scale, and to connect that to our human needs. The appropriate scale need not rule out multiscale computer modelling, in which some supercode integrates relevant scales in one pass, hoping to combine the best of methods for two or more levels.

The generation of a C-O bond at the expense of a C-H bond during this process may be considered the most basic form of C-H functionalization. This illustrates the extreme generality of the term \"C-H functionalization\", because it can describe the conversion of literally any C-H bond into a C-X bond (X being anything except H). Therefore, it may be of use to distinguish between what, in our view, are two distinct categories of C-H functionalization logic: \"guided\" and \"innate\". Guided C-H functionalizations, as the name implies, are guided by external reagents or directing groups (covalently or fleetingly bound) to install new functional groups at the expense of specifically targeted C-H bonds. Conversely, innate C-H functionalizations may be broadly defined as reactions that exchange C-H bonds for new functional groups based solely on natural reactivity patterns in the absence of other directing forces.  Two substrates that illustrate this distinction are dihydrojunenol and isonicotinic acid. The C-H functionalization processes of hydroxylation or arylation, respectively, can take place at multiple locations on each molecule. Innate functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are dictated by the inherent bias (steric or electronic) of the substrate undergoing C-H cleavage, whereas guided functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are controlled by external directing forces such as metal complexation or steric bias of the reagent. Although the distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalizations may not always be clear in cases that do not fit neatly into a single category, it is a useful convention to consider when analyzing reactivity patterns and strategies for synthesis. We must emphasize that although a completely rigorous distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalization may not be practical, we have nonetheless found it to be a useful tool at the planning stage of synthesis.  In this Account, we trace our own studies in the area of C-H functionalization in synthesis through the lens of \"guided\" and \"innate\" descriptors. We show how harnessing innate reactivity can be beneficial for achieving unique bond constructions between heterocycles and carbonyl compounds, enabling rapid and scalable total syntheses. Guided and innate functionalizations were used synergistically to create an entire family of terpenes in a controlled fashion. We continue with a discussion of the synthesis of complex alkaloids with high nitrogen content, which required the invention of a uniquely chemoselective innate C-H functionalization protocol. These findings led us to develop a series of innate C-H functionalization reactions for forging C-C bonds of interest to the largest body of practicing organic chemists: medicinal chemists. Strategic use of C-H functionalization logic can have a dramatically positive effect on the efficiency of synthesis, whether guided or innate.",

His discovery ushered in the use of Lewis acids as reagents and catalysts for organic reactions. However, in recent years, the recognition that Lewis bases can also serve in this capacity has grown enormously. Most importantly, it has become increasingly apparent that the behavior of Lewis bases as agents for promoting chemical reactions is not merely as an electronic complement of the cognate Lewis acids: in fact Lewis bases are capable of enhancing both the electrophilic and nucleophilic character of molecules to which they are bound.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The numerical limits are set by ½ and -1, between which all stable isotropic materials are found. With new experiments, computational methods and routes to materials synthesis, we assess what Poisson's ratio means in the contemporary understanding of the mechanical characteristics of modern materials. Central to these recent advances, we emphasize the significance of relationships outside the elastic limit between Poisson's ratio and densification, connectivity, ductility and the toughness of solids; and their association with the dynamic properties of the liquids from which they were condensed and into which they melt.",

The raw material for microelectronics is the single crystal of silicon, with very high purity and almost perfect crystal structure. About 95% of the world's current production of silicon single crystals is achieved using the process that Jan Czochralski discovered in 1916. Today, single crystals of silicon can be grown that are up to 2 m long, 300 mm in diameter, and weigh up to 265 kg. The use of magnetic fields has led to significant advances in crystal-drawing technology. Intensive research and development reveals that in addition to the technology, which provides crystals of ever-increasing diameter, defect engineering, and the control of the numerous temperature-dependent reactions of crystal defects, are of paramount importance.",

Polarizability, a physical property, is an inverse measure of resistance to deformation and thus should be inversely related to hardness. This is indeed generally accepted. Hardness has been postulated to be the second derivative of a system's energy with respect to its number of electrons, despite the fact that this involves the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. This second derivative is typically approximated as the difference between the ionization energy I and the electron affinity A of the ground-state system, which results in ambiguity in that many molecules do not form stable negative ions. For atoms, the quantity I - A does vary approximately inversely with polarizability, but this is only because the electron affinity is usually relatively low and ionization energy is known to be inversely related to polarizability for atoms. However, molecular polarizability depends primarily upon volume, and so does not show an acceptable inverse correlation with I - A. Since both hardness and polarizability refer to the same property of a system-its resistance to deformation of the electronic density, we propose that the reciprocal of polarizability be taken to be a measure of hardness. We show that polarizabilities that are not known can be estimated quite accurately in terms of the average local ionization energies on the atomic or molecular surfaces and, for molecules, their volumes.",

Yet the likelihood that pure science will lead directly to the discovery of really new materials will be only slightly greater in the future than it was in the past unless methods for handling wholes can be developed that are precise enough to be called scientific and communicable enough to be taught. This is a task that the scientist has in the past rightly and profitably refused to accept. We need a supergenius to develop some principles, not of simple particles and their interactions, but of extremely complex structures with parts interacting with other parts, on all levels, and with a hierarchy of interpenetrating substructures combining to form many levels of interpenetrating superstructure (21).",

We consider the variation in stability between different categories of systems-hydrogen-bonded, halogen-bonded, and weakly bound cocrystals-finding that, contrary to chemical intuition, the presence of hydrogen or halogen bond interactions is not necessarily a good predictor of stability. Finally, we investigate the correlation of the relative stability with simple chemical descriptors: changes in packing efficiency and hydrogen bond strength. We find some broad qualitative agreement with chemical intuition-more densely packed cocrystals with stronger hydrogen bonding tend to be more stable-but the relationship is weak, suggesting that such simple descriptors do not capture the complex balance of interactions driving cocrystallization. Our conclusions suggest that while cocrystallization is often a thermodynamically favorable process, it remains difficult to formulate general rules to guide synthesis, highlighting the continued importance of high-level computation in predicting and rationalizing such systems.",

Although chitin, a main component of the shells of crustaceans, can be converted to valuable products by means of homogeneous catalysis, most of the chitin is treated as industrial waste because use of homogeneous catalysts is compromised by difficulties associated with product separation from the catalysts and the recyclability of the catalysts. Thus, a method for converting chitin to useful chemicals, such as lactic acid, by using solid catalysts would be beneficial. Magnesium oxide catalysts can be reused twice without loss of activity.

At the same time, the cost of raw materials and solvent waste disposal is also growing, making sustainability an increasingly important factor in the production of synthetic life-saving/improving compounds. With these forces in mind, our group is driven by the principle that how we synthesize a molecule is as important as which molecule we choose to synthesize. We aim to define alternative strategies that will enable more efficient synthesis of complex molecules. Drawing our inspiration from nature, we attempt to mimic (1) the multicatalytic metabolic systems within cells using collections of nonenzyme catalysts in batch reactors and (2) the serial synthetic machinery of fatty acid/polyketide biosynthesis using microreactor systems. Whether we combine catalysts in batch to prepare an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or use microreactors to synthesize small or polymeric molecules, we strive to understand the mechanism of each reaction while also developing new methods and techniques.  This Account begins by examining our early efforts in the development of novel catalytic materials and characterization of catalytic systems and how these observations helped forge our current models for developing efficient synthetic routes. The Account progresses through a focused examination of design principles needed to develop multicatalyst systems using systems recently published by our group as examples. Our systems have been successfully applied to produce APIs as well as new synthetic methods. The multicatalyst section is then juxtaposed with our work in continuous flow multistep synthesis. Here, we discuss the design principles needed to create multistep continuous processes using examples from our recent efforts. Overall, this Account illustrates how multistep organic routes can be conceived and achieved using strategies and techniques that mimic biological systems.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The generation of a C-O bond at the expense of a C-H bond during this process may be considered the most basic form of C-H functionalization. This illustrates the extreme generality of the term \"C-H functionalization\", because it can describe the conversion of literally any C-H bond into a C-X bond (X being anything except H). Therefore, it may be of use to distinguish between what, in our view, are two distinct categories of C-H functionalization logic: \"guided\" and \"innate\". Guided C-H functionalizations, as the name implies, are guided by external reagents or directing groups (covalently or fleetingly bound) to install new functional groups at the expense of specifically targeted C-H bonds. Conversely, innate C-H functionalizations may be broadly defined as reactions that exchange C-H bonds for new functional groups based solely on natural reactivity patterns in the absence of other directing forces.  Two substrates that illustrate this distinction are dihydrojunenol and isonicotinic acid. The C-H functionalization processes of hydroxylation or arylation, respectively, can take place at multiple locations on each molecule. Innate functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are dictated by the inherent bias (steric or electronic) of the substrate undergoing C-H cleavage, whereas guided functionalizations lead to substitution patterns that are controlled by external directing forces such as metal complexation or steric bias of the reagent. Although the distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalizations may not always be clear in cases that do not fit neatly into a single category, it is a useful convention to consider when analyzing reactivity patterns and strategies for synthesis. We must emphasize that although a completely rigorous distinction between guided and innate C-H functionalization may not be practical, we have nonetheless found it to be a useful tool at the planning stage of synthesis.  In this Account, we trace our own studies in the area of C-H functionalization in synthesis through the lens of \"guided\" and \"innate\" descriptors. We show how harnessing innate reactivity can be beneficial for achieving unique bond constructions between heterocycles and carbonyl compounds, enabling rapid and scalable total syntheses. Guided and innate functionalizations were used synergistically to create an entire family of terpenes in a controlled fashion. We continue with a discussion of the synthesis of complex alkaloids with high nitrogen content, which required the invention of a uniquely chemoselective innate C-H functionalization protocol. These findings led us to develop a series of innate C-H functionalization reactions for forging C-C bonds of interest to the largest body of practicing organic chemists: medicinal chemists. Strategic use of C-H functionalization logic can have a dramatically positive effect on the efficiency of synthesis, whether guided or innate.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The formation of chiral oxazolines from these materials provided interesting and useful starting materials for these studies. The factors responsible for high optical yields during that era were attributed to rigidity or precomplexation of the reactants, thus providing a more well-defined topography during the reaction course. A number of C-C bond reaction types are described including alkylations, additions, and organometallic reactions. The ee's of many of the products arrived at are well above 90%. This level of ee was virtually unprecedented in the early to mid 1970s.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

However, it is less clear whether combinatorial approaches will result in quantum advances in therapeutics. Nor is there general agreement about the factors most important in defining how combinatorial strategies will provide value to the discovery of lead and therapeutic compounds. In this review, we propose criteria that define the value of combinatorial strategies and categorize the various approaches by: (a) the type of chemical space to be searched, (b) the tactics employed to synthesize and screen libraries, and (c) the structures of individual molecules in libraries. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various strategies and suggest milestones that can help to track their success.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

A Beginner's Guide to Medicinal Chemistry.\nModern medicinal chemistry is a complex, multidimensional discipline that operates at the interface of the chemical and biological sciences. The medicinal chemistry contribution to drug discovery is typically described in the context of the well-recited linear progression of the drug discovery pipeline. However, compound optimization is idiosyncratic to each project, and clear definitions of hit and lead molecules and the subsequent progress along the pipeline becomes easily blurred. In addition, this description lacks insight into the entangled relationship between chemical and pharmacological properties, and thus provides limited guidance on how innovative medicinal chemistry strategies can be applied to solve optimization problems, regardless of the stage in the pipeline. Through discussion and illustrative examples, this article seeks to provide insights into the finesse of medicinal chemistry and the subtlety of balancing chemical properties pharmacology. In so doing, it aims to serve as an accessible and simple-to-digest guide for anyone who wishes to learn about the underlying principles of medicinal chemistry, in a context that has been decoupled from the pipeline description.",

The potential search space is infinite in principle and enormous in practice, yet optimal molecules, materials, and synthesis conditions for many objectives can often be found by performing a reasonable number of distinct experiments. Considering the goal of chemical synthesis or property identification as optimal control problems provides insight into this good fortune. Both of these goals may be described by a fitness function J that depends on a suitable set of variables (e.g., reactant concentrations, components of a material, processing conditions, etc.). The relationship between J and the variables specifies the fitness landscape for the target objective. Upon making simple physical assumptions, this work demonstrates that the fitness landscape for chemical optimization contains no local sub-optimal maxima that may hinder attainment of the absolute best value of J. This feature provides a basis to explain the many reported efficient optimizations of synthesis conditions and molecular or material properties. We refer to this development as OptiChem theory. The predicted characteristics of chemical fitness landscapes are assessed through a broad examination of the recent literature, which shows ample evidence of trap-free landscapes for many objectives. The fundamental and practical implications of OptiChem theory for chemistry are discussed.",

It may be that in complex fields this is inevitable, for science invokes subtle abstractions which are necessarily concerned sequentially with parts rather than simultaneously with a whole system. But how enormously better off we are now than we were in 1900, for we at least now understand the physical principles behind most of the properties of ceramics and metals, and more than one practical achievement stems directly from a scientist's suggestion. No practical man now understands metals better than the solid-state physicist; this was certainly not true even as little as 20 years ago. Yet the likelihood that pure science will lead directly to the discovery of really new materials will be only slightly greater in the future than it was in the past unless methods for handling wholes can be developed that are precise enough to be called scientific and communicable enough to be taught. This is a task that the scientist has in the past rightly and profitably refused to accept. We need a supergenius to develop some principles, not of simple particles and their interactions, but of extremely complex structures with parts interacting with other parts, on all levels, and with a hierarchy of interpenetrating substructures combining to form many levels of interpenetrating superstructure (21).",

What is the relationship between the structure of a molecule and the structure of the crystal it forms? Why do some molecules adopt more than one crystal structure? Why do some crystal structures contain solvent? How does one design a crystal structure with a specified topology of molecules, or a specified coordination of molecules and/or ions, or with a specified property? What are the relationships between crystal structures and properties for molecular crystals? These are some of the questions that are being addressed today by the crystal engineering community, a group that draws from the larger communities of organic, inorganic, and physical chemists, crystallographers, and solid state scientists. This Perspective provides a brief historical introduction to crystal engineering itself and an assessment of the importance and utility of the supramolecular synthon, which is one of the most important concepts in the practical use and implementation of crystal design. It also provides a look to the future from the viewpoint of the author, and indicates some directions in which this field might be moving. ",

Materials discovery is frustratingly slow, with the large time and resource cost often providing only small gains in property performance. Furthermore, researchers are unwilling to take large risks that they will only know the outcome of months or years later. Computation is playing an increasing role in allowing rapid screening of large numbers of materials from vast search space to identify promising candidates for laboratory synthesis and testing. However, there is a problem, in that many materials computationally predicted to have encouraging properties cannot be readily realised in the lab. This minireview looks at how we can tackle the problem of confirming that hypothetical materials are synthetically realisable, through consideration of all the stages of the materials discovery process, from obtaining the components, reacting them to a material in the correct structure, through to processing into a desired form. In an ideal world, a material prediction would come with an associated 'recipe' for the successful laboratory preparation of the material. We discuss the opportunity to thus prevent wasted effort in experimental discovery programmes, including those using automation, to accelerate the discovery of novel materials.",

It is devoted to the understanding of the relationship between (a) fundamental physical and chemical properties governing processes at the atomistic scale with (b) typically macroscopic properties required of materials in engineering applications. For many materials, this relationship is not only determined by chemical composition, but strongly governed by microstructure. The latter is a consequence of carefully selected process conditions (e.g., mechanical forming and annealing in metallurgy or epitaxial growth in semiconductor technology). A key task of computational materials science is to unravel the often hidden composition-structure-property relationships using computational techniques. The present paper does not aim to give a complete review of all aspects of materials science. Rather, we will present the key concepts underlying the computation of selected material properties and discuss the major classes of materials to which they are applied. Specifically, our focus will be on methods used to describe single or polycrystalline bulk materials of semiconductor, metal or ceramic form.",

Linking underlying processes to what we handle is sometimes called 'spanning' (or 'bridging') length scales, giving the impression that the mesoscale is a swamp to be crossed without getting mud on our boots. This is misleading: we do not wish to span the mesoscale, but to work at the appropriate scale, and to connect that to our human needs. The appropriate scale need not rule out multiscale computer modelling, in which some supercode integrates relevant scales in one pass, hoping to combine the best of methods for two or more levels.

In general, the new results lead to values of the constants with uncertainties 5 to 7 times smaller than the uncertainties assigned the 1986 values. However, the changes in the values themselves are less than twice the 1986 assigned one-standard-deviation uncertainties and thus are not highly significant. Although much new data has become available since 1986, three new results dominate the analysis: a value of the Planck constant obtained from a realization of the watt; a value of the fine-structure constant obtained from the magnetic moment anomaly of the electron; and a value of the molar gas constant obtained from the speed of sound in argon. Because of their dominant role in determining the values and uncertainties of many of the constants, it is highly desirable that additional results of comparable uncertainty that corroborate these three data items be obtained before the next adjustment is carried out. Until then, the 1986 CODATA set of recommended values will remain the set of choice.",

Polarizability, a physical property, is an inverse measure of resistance to deformation and thus should be inversely related to hardness. This is indeed generally accepted. Hardness has been postulated to be the second derivative of a system's energy with respect to its number of electrons, despite the fact that this involves the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. This second derivative is typically approximated as the difference between the ionization energy I and the electron affinity A of the ground-state system, which results in ambiguity in that many molecules do not form stable negative ions. For atoms, the quantity I - A does vary approximately inversely with polarizability, but this is only because the electron affinity is usually relatively low and ionization energy is known to be inversely related to polarizability for atoms. However, molecular polarizability depends primarily upon volume, and so does not show an acceptable inverse correlation with I - A. Since both hardness and polarizability refer to the same property of a system-its resistance to deformation of the electronic density, we propose that the reciprocal of polarizability be taken to be a measure of hardness. We show that polarizabilities that are not known can be estimated quite accurately in terms of the average local ionization energies on the atomic or molecular surfaces and, for molecules, their volumes.",

It may be that in complex fields this is inevitable, for science invokes subtle abstractions which are necessarily concerned sequentially with parts rather than simultaneously with a whole system. But how enormously better off we are now than we were in 1900, for we at least now understand the physical principles behind most of the properties of ceramics and metals, and more than one practical achievement stems directly from a scientist's suggestion. No practical man now understands metals better than the solid-state physicist; this was certainly not true even as little as 20 years ago. Yet the likelihood that pure science will lead directly to the discovery of really new materials will be only slightly greater in the future than it was in the past unless methods for handling wholes can be developed that are precise enough to be called scientific and communicable enough to be taught. This is a task that the scientist has in the past rightly and profitably refused to accept. We need a supergenius to develop some principles, not of simple particles and their interactions, but of extremely complex structures with parts interacting with other parts, on all levels, and with a hierarchy of interpenetrating substructures combining to form many levels of interpenetrating superstructure (21).",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In particular, enthusiasm for conducting unbiased (non-structure-guided) screens of large libraries for protein or RNA ligands has waned. A central challenge in this area is to devise methods for the synthesis of chemically diverse, high-quality libraries of molecules with many of the desirable features of natural products. These include diverse functionality, a significant representation of chiral sp(3) centers that provide conformational bias to the molecule, significant skeletal diversity, and good pharmacokinetic properties. However, these libraries must be easy to make from cheap, readily available building blocks, ideally those that would support convenient hit optimization/structure reactivity relationship studies.

Multicomponent reaction (MCR) chemistry is very well suited for the synthesis of a diverse range of macrocycles and is also able to generate great levels of molecular diversity and complexity at low synthetic costs.",

The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

In addition, we summarize the results of a new analysis of coordinated activity cliffs and clusters they form.

The concept of QbD can be extended to analytical methods. QbD mandates the definition of a goal for the method, and emphasizes thorough evaluation and scouting of alternative methods in a systematic way to obtain optimal method performance. Candidate methods are then carefully assessed in a structured manner for risks, and are challenged to determine if robustness and ruggedness criteria are satisfied. As a result of these studies, the method performance can be understood and improved if necessary, and a control strategy can be defined to manage risk and ensure the method performs as desired when validated and deployed. In this review, the current state of analytical QbD in the industry is detailed with examples of the application of analytical QbD principles to a range of analytical methods, including high-performance liquid chromatography, Karl Fischer titration for moisture content, vibrational spectroscopy for chemical identification, quantitative color measurement, and trace analysis for genotoxic impurities.",

With the objective to curb the rising costs for development and regulatory barriers to innovation and creativity, QbD is being widely promoted by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). This review describes the elements, different design and tools of QbD as well as multidimensional applications of QbD ranging from dosage form and method development to meeting latest regulatory requirements. The understanding of a process is facilitated by proper identification of sources of variation, management of variability by process design, and prediction of product quality attributes using design space. The pharmaceutical industry is rapidly adopting the QbD principles for fabrication of safe, effective and quality products; however, we are still on a journey and the process of gathering all experience and metrics required for connecting and demonstrating QbD benefits to all stakeholders is still in progress. Understanding the formulation and process parameters with the philosophy of QbD will be useful for the optimization of complex drug delivery systems in the near future.",

Over the years, the relative synchronous development of technologies for parallel synthesis and characterization has been accompanied by developments in associated software and information technologies. This Review aims to provide a comprehensive overview on the state of the art of the field by selected examples. Technologies developed to aid research on complex materials are covered as well as databases, design of experiment, data-mining technologies, modeling approaches, and evolutionary strategies for development. Different methods for parallel synthesis provide single sample libraries, gradient libraries for electronic or optical materials, similar to polymers and catalysts, and products produced through formulation strategies. Many examples illustrate the variety of isolated solutions and document the barely recognized variety of new methods for the synthesis and analysis of almost any material. The Review ends with a summary of success stories and statements on still-present problems and future tasks.",

Fortunately, the practically endless pool of synthetic chemical reactions developed to date can often be combined in an orthogonal manner to provide elegant solutions to complex chemical problems. In this review, we first highlight some of the many photochemical reactions that have been applied in orthogonal reaction protocols; the highly selective nature of photochemical reactions makes them well-suited for independent activation in the presence of other reaction components. The application of these orthogonal reactions, especially photochemical reactions, for the synthesis and modification of polymers and polymeric materials is also summarized. Importantly, the use of orthogonal chemical reactions can provide additional opportunities for synthesizing advanced and functional polymeric materials compared to traditional synthetic procedures.",

A broad range of disciplines, including process chemistry (organic synthesis), analytical chemistry, process engineering (mass and heat transfer, unit operations), process safety (chemical risk assessment), regulatory compliance, and plant operation, must be effectively applied. In the critical handover between medicinal chemistry and PR&amp;D, compound production is typically scaled up from a few hundred grams to several kilograms. Can the methodologies applied to the former also satisfy the technical, safety, and scalability aspects that come into play in the latter? Occasionally, the transition might occur smoothly, but more often the situation is the opposite: much work and resources must be invested to design a process that is feasible for manufacturing on pilot scale and, eventually, for commercial production. Authentic examples provide enlightening illustrations of dos and don'ts for developing syntheses designed for round-flask operation into production-scale processes. Factors that are easily underestimated or even neglected in the laboratory, such as method robustness, chemical hazards, safety concerns, environmental impact, availability of starting materials and building blocks in bulk quantities, intellectual property (IP) issues, and the final cost of the product, will come into play and need to be addressed appropriately. The decision on which route will be the best for further development is a crucial event and should come into focus early on the R&amp;D timeline. In addition to scientific and technical concerns, the parameter of speed has come to the forefront in the pharmaceutical arena. Although historically the drug industry has tolerated a total time investment of far more than 10 years from idea to market, the current worldwide paradigm requires a reduction to under 10 years for the specific segment covering preclinical development through launch. This change puts enormous pressure on the entire organization, and the implication for PR&amp;D is that the time allowed for conducting route design and scale-up has shrunk accordingly. Furthermore, molecular complexity has become extremely challenging in many instances, and demand steadily grows for process understanding and knowledge generation about low-level byproduct, which often must be controlled even at trace concentrations to meet regulatory specifications (especially in the case of potentially genotoxic impurities). In this Account, we paint a broad picture of the technical challenges the PR&amp;D community is grappling with today, focusing on what measures have been taken over the years to create more efficiency and effectiveness.",

The potential search space is infinite in principle and enormous in practice, yet optimal molecules, materials, and synthesis conditions for many objectives can often be found by performing a reasonable number of distinct experiments. Considering the goal of chemical synthesis or property identification as optimal control problems provides insight into this good fortune. Both of these goals may be described by a fitness function J that depends on a suitable set of variables (e.g., reactant concentrations, components of a material, processing conditions, etc.). The relationship between J and the variables specifies the fitness landscape for the target objective. Upon making simple physical assumptions, this work demonstrates that the fitness landscape for chemical optimization contains no local sub-optimal maxima that may hinder attainment of the absolute best value of J. This feature provides a basis to explain the many reported efficient optimizations of synthesis conditions and molecular or material properties. We refer to this development as OptiChem theory. The predicted characteristics of chemical fitness landscapes are assessed through a broad examination of the recent literature, which shows ample evidence of trap-free landscapes for many objectives.

In fact, one of the first things that freshmen in organic chemistry learn is how to join two molecules together to obtain a more complex one. Of course they still have a long way to go to become fully mature synthetic chemists, but they must have the primary instinct to build molecules, as synthesis is the essence of organic chemistry. With the different points of view that actually coexist in the chemical community about the maturity of the science (art, or both) of organic synthesis, it is clear that nowadays we know how to make almost all of the most complex molecules ever isolated. The primary question is how easy is it to accomplish? For the readers of papers describing the total synthesis of either simple or complex molecules, it appears that the routes followed are, most of the time, smooth and free of troubles. The synthetic scheme written on paper is, apparently, done in the laboratory with few, if any, modifications and these, essentially, seem to be based on finding the optimal experimental conditions to effect the desired reaction. Failures in the planned synthetic scheme to achieve the goal, detours imposed by unexpected reactivity, or the absence of reactivity are almost never discussed, since they may diminish the value of the work reported. This review attempts to look at total synthesis from a different side; it will focus on troubles found during the synthetic work that cause detours from the original synthetic plan, or on the dead ends that eventually may force redesign. From there, the evolution from the original route to the final successful one that achieves the synthetic target will be presented. The syntheses discussed in this paper have been selected because they contain explicit information about the failures of the original synthetic plan, together with the evolution of the final route to the target molecule. Therefore, they contain a lot of useful negative information that may otherwise be lost.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

From these beginnings, molecules from nature were indespensible tools as generations of organic chemists developed new techniques for determining structures, analyzed the mechanisms of reactions, explored the effects conformation and stereochemistry on reactions, and found challenging new targets to synthesize. Only recently have organic chemists harnessed the powerful techniques of organic chemistry to study the functions of organic molecules in their biological hosts, the enzymes that synthesize molecules and the complex processes that occur in a cell. In this Perspective, I present a personal account of my entree into bioorganic chemistry as a physical organic chemist and subsequent work to understand the chemical mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, to develop techniques to identify and assign hydrogen bonds in tRNAs through NMR studies with isotopically labeled molecules, and to study how structure determines function in biosynthetic enzymes with proteins obtained by genetic engineering.",

One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions.

Solid-state analyses combined with covalent disconnection and quantization of the liberated components allowed identification of a three-component monomeric unit repeated within a range of assembled oligomeric adducts whose repartition and binding capacity can be finely tuned through the starting stoichiometries. The self-assembly of these architectures occurs through the simultaneous creation of more than 25 covalent bonds per molecular entity. It appears that the thermodynamic selection is directed by the packing efficiency of these adducts, explaining the spectacular building block discrimination between homologues differing by one carbon unit. This selectivity, combined with the reversible nature of the system, provided pure molecular building blocks after a simple chemical disconnection, promoting CO(2) as a green auxiliary to purify polyaldehyde or polyamine from mixtures of homologous structures. Moreover, the gas template could be expelled as a pure compound under thermodynamic control.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with <iNSR</i the interesting field of C-H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Many of the instrumental tools that helped the discipline develop in so many different ways began to appear in the late thirties and during World War II and were soon built to be increasingly operated in the \"hands-on\" mode. This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were (14)C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of (19)F, (13)C, and (15)N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring Huckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists.

Recent advances in the area of MCR chemistry have included the discovery of new reactions, development of the first asymmetric catalysts, and the application of MCRs to natural products and other targets of biological interest. This review will highlight recent developments in MCRs as a rich source of molecular diversity.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Large-scale analysis of ACs has revealed characteristic features across many different compound activity classes.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In fact, one of the first things that freshmen in organic chemistry learn is how to join two molecules together to obtain a more complex one. Of course they still have a long way to go to become fully mature synthetic chemists, but they must have the primary instinct to build molecules, as synthesis is the essence of organic chemistry. With the different points of view that actually coexist in the chemical community about the maturity of the science (art, or both) of organic synthesis, it is clear that nowadays we know how to make almost all of the most complex molecules ever isolated. The primary question is how easy is it to accomplish? For the readers of papers describing the total synthesis of either simple or complex molecules, it appears that the routes followed are, most of the time, smooth and free of troubles. The synthetic scheme written on paper is, apparently, done in the laboratory with few, if any, modifications and these, essentially, seem to be based on finding the optimal experimental conditions to effect the desired reaction. Failures in the planned synthetic scheme to achieve the goal, detours imposed by unexpected reactivity, or the absence of reactivity are almost never discussed, since they may diminish the value of the work reported. This review attempts to look at total synthesis from a different side; it will focus on troubles found during the synthetic work that cause detours from the original synthetic plan, or on the dead ends that eventually may force redesign. From there, the evolution from the original route to the final successful one that achieves the synthetic target will be presented. The syntheses discussed in this paper have been selected because they contain explicit information about the failures of the original synthetic plan, together with the evolution of the final route to the target molecule. Therefore, they contain a lot of useful negative information that may otherwise be lost.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",
