Sugar molecules are attached to the dolichol through a pyrophosphate linkage (one phosphate was originally linked to dolichol, and the second phosphate came from the nucleotide sugar). The oligosaccharide chain is then extended through the addition of various sugar molecules in a stepwise manner to form a precursor oligosaccharide.

Lennarz and his lab mates discovered that these sugars are transferred as a group, and are synthesized from a dolichol-linked oligosaccharide with a conserved structure. They found the precursor for these molecules had the structure (Man)nGlcNAcB1,4 \u2192GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, and each precursor had at least five mannose residues. Additionally, they discovered that precursor molecules contain one to two glucose molecules, which was a surprising find.

Upon entering the ER a molecule containing 14 sugar subunits is linked en bloc to an asparagine in a selective manner by the enzyme oligosaccharyl transferase. It is this oligosaccharide molecule which is modified by a series of enzymes as the protein moves through the different compartments of the Golgi apparatus. Endoglycosidase H is able to cleave each structure of this oligosaccharide as it is processed until the enzyme Golgi alpha-mannosidase II removes two mannose subunits.

Ceramide can be further hydrolyzed by acid ceramidase to form sphingosine and a free fatty acid, both of which are able to leave the lysosome, unlike ceramide. The long-chain sphingoid bases released from the lysosome may then re-enter pathways for synthesis of ceramide and/or sphingosine-1-phosphate. The salvage pathway re-utilizes long-chain sphingoid bases to form ceramide through the action of ceramide synthase. Thus, ceramide synthase family members probably trap free sphingosine released from the lysosome",

Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

Preparation and structure The compound consists of separate tetrahedral ammonium cations and octahedral [PtCl6]2\u2212 anions. It is usually generated as a fine yellow precipitate by treating a solution of hexachloroplatinic acid with a solution of an ammonium salt. The complex is so poorly soluble that this step is employed in the isolation of platinum from ores and recycled residues. As analyzed by X-ray crystallography, the salt crystallizes in a cubic motif reminiscent of the fluorite structure. The [PtCl6]2\u2212 centers are octahedral. The NH4+ centers are hydrogen bonded to the chloride ligands.",

Water spontaneously ionizes into hydroxide anions and hydronium cations. The salt also dissociates into its constituent anions and cations. For example, sodium acetate dissociates in water into sodium and acetate ions.

A Piper diagram is a graphical representation of the chemistry of a water sample or samples. The cations and anions are shown by separate ternary plots. The apexes of the cation plot are calcium, magnesium and sodium plus potassium cations. The apexes of the anion plot are sulfate, chloride and carbonate plus hydrogen carbonate anions.

Tremorgens have been implicated in a number of neurologic diseases of cattle collectively known as staggers syndromes, and pose significant agricultural and health problems for both cattle and humans. Although the effects of tremorgens are thought to result from transient perturbations of amino acid neurotransmitter release mechanisms, there is reason to believe that acute exposures to toxins with such synaptic effects may result in degeneration of neuronal fiber processes. To test this hypothesis, rats were given a single tremorgenic (3 mg/kg, IP) dose of aflatrem, and kinetics of amino acid neurotransmitter uptake was assessed in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals at 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks after injection. Results indicate a decrease in the capacity of the GABA and glutamate uptake systems, which was interpreted as a loss of nerve terminals. The affinity constants suggest a decrease in release of these transmitters as well. In addition to its transient influence on transmitter release, a single low dose of aflatrem is able to induce degeneration of neuronal processes in hippocampal neurotransmitter systems and therefore represents a long-term health threat.",

Except for a few toxins that are produced by Claviceps paspali, a plant parasitic fungus, most tremorgenic mycotoxins are synthesized by common saprophytic moulds of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus. Since these compounds produce sustained tremor in the abscence of other neurotoxic effects, several authors have suggested that they are the causative agents of a number of naturally occurring incoordination syndromes in ruminants. The nature of the tremor produced by these compounds in laboratory animals is clinically indistinguishable from that occurring naturally. In particular, the most implicated tremorgenic mycotoxins are those that contain a single nitrogen atom in their molecules. Although individual compounds within this group are produced by unrelated fungal species, they all contain a similar biologically active chemical moiety. To date, their mechanism of action is unknown, and their role in neuropharmacology has not yet been defined. However, the presence of a GABA-like conformation within their active nucleus and the limited torsional flexibility of this moiety suggest that they are partial agonists of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid).

The mycotoxins were tested in two short-term in vitro assays with the use of different genotoxic end points in different phylogenetic systems (the Ames Salmonella/mammalian-microsome assay and the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay of human lymphocytes). According to the results obtained in this study, all of the investigated mycotoxins except penitrem A exhibited a certain degree of genotoxicity. Verrucosidin appeared to have the highest toxic potential, testing positive in both assays.

However, lolitrem E and paspalicine although showing potent BK channel activity, elicit a non-tremorgenic effect on animals. This could be related to structural changes occurring in vivo, rendering it less active 25 . Knaus et al., suggested that although some pharmacological properties could be explained by BK channel inhibition, tremorgenicity may not be directly related to channel blockade 26 . Thus, it is possible that the relationship between tremor and BK channel activity is more of a complex interaction.

Thus, the hypothesis that lolitrem B affects, in part, neurotransmitter receptors leading to interference with neurotransmitter release in the central and peripheral nervous system needs to be examined.Also, early work investigating the mode of action of the mycotoxins penitrem A and verruculogen shows that these toxins interfere with amino acid neurotransmitter release mechanisms in the central nervous system[27][28][29]. Together these data suggest region specific effects for this toxin in the brain, the effects of which have not been previously investigated.To determine the effects of lolitrem B, and members of the indole diterpenoid biosynthesis pathway, on neurotransmitter and amino acid levels in the brain, a functional metabolomics study was undertaken.

In addition to tremors and convulsions, the tremorgen caused acute toxicity in mice. Three isolates of Penicillium cyclopium produced a chemical that evoked neurotoxic symptoms similar to those caused by the compound from A. flavus (5). P. palitans, a mold closely related to P. cyclopium, produced a tremorgenic mycotoxin which, when administered to mice ip, caused tremors with as little as 125 gg/kg (1).

It belongs to a group of tremorgenic mycotoxins that are known to act on the central nervous system, thereby causing tremors and convulsions with an intensity ranging from fully reversible without notable lesions to entirely fatal [3,4]. Molds producing such tremorgens pose a recognized health risk to humans and animals when these microorganisms are present in spoiled food or feed. For example, livestock grazing on moldy pastures may develop sporadic locomotor incoordination, where they may stagger, fall over, and suffer muscular spasms [5,6]. However, the mode of action for many of these mycotoxins has not been elucidated in detail.\n\nIt was reported recently [7] that VCD was able to kill human HT29 colon carcinoma cells in culture under glucose-deprived conditions. As well, VCD blocked the increased expression of glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) [7], a protein that is strongly induced during hypoglycemic stress and serves to ensure continued cellular survival under these conditions [8]. GRP78 is a key component of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular process that is triggered in response to a variety of stress conditions that interfere with proper protein folding and processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [9]. For example, ER stress and subsequent activation of the UPR can be caused not only by hypoglycemia, but also by hypoxia and intracellular redox imbalance, as well as by a number of natural compounds, such as the sequiterpene lactone thapsigargin (which disturbes the intracellular calcium balance [10]) and the nucleoside antibiotic tunicamycin (which interferes with glycoprotein synthesis [11]). A common feature of these ER stressors is the ensuing accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins, and the risk of proteotoxicity. As an adaptive response, the UPR activates a set of pathways that result in the transcriptional activation of several important proteins, including GRP78, aimed at restoring proper protein processing and overall cellular homeostasis [12,13,14].",

Cattle are sometimes affected by tremors (also called \"staggers\") when they graze on toxic grass pastures, and Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon , kweek) has been known to be associated with tremors for several decades. This study reports the identification of paspalitrems and paspaline-like indole-diterpenes in the seedheads of Claviceps cynodontis -infected Bermuda grass collected from a pasture that had caused a staggers syndrome in cattle in South Africa and thereby links the condition to specific mycotoxins. The highest concentration (about 150 mg/kg) was found for paspalitrem B. Ergonovine and ergine (lysergic acid amide), together with their C-8 epimers, were found to co-occur with the indole-diterpenes at concentrations of about 10 microg/kg. The indole-diterpene profile of the extract from the ergotized Bermuda grass was similar to that of Claviceps paspali sclerotia. However, the C. paspali sclerotia contained in addition agroclavine and elymoclavine. This is the first study linking tremors associated with grazing of Bermuda grass to specific tremorgenic indole-diterpenoid mycotoxins.",

Herein, we analyzed more than 1000 Streptomyces strains and noticed a big quantitative gap between the strains with GBL biosynthetic genes and the strains with GBL receptor genes, which implies the wide-spread of GBLs as interspecies signals in Streptomyces and their great potential in the activation of silent natural product gene clusters. Streptomyces albidoflavus J1074, which has one GBL receptor gene but no GBL biosynthetic gene, was chosen as a target to study the possible interspecies communication roles of GBLs. At first, the GBL biosynthetic genes from Streptomyces coelicolor M145 were expressed in S. albidoflavus J1074, which enabled the S. albidoflavus strains to synthesize Streptomyces coelicolor butanolides (SCBs) and activated the production of paulomycins. Further studies showed that this activation process requires the participation of the GBL receptor gene XNR_4681. The results suggest that the expression of exogenous GBL biosynthetic genes can modulate the metabolisms of GBL non-producing strains, and this regulation role might be meaningful for silent gene cluster activation in Streptomyces. At final, we synthesized racemic-SCB2 and tried to simplify the activation process by adding SCB2 directly to S. albidoflavus J1074, which unfortunately failed to induce paulomycin production.",

One representative and parent diterpene in this class is phorbol isolated from Croton tiglium [86]. The tigliane diterpenes widely distribute in many species from the genus Daphne [20,65,87], Pimelea [88], and Stellera [89] in the Thymelaeaceae fam, as well as Euphorbia [90,91] and Jatropha [86] in the Euphorbiaceae family. As compared to the phorbol esters (124)(125)(126)(127)(128)(129)(130), there are structural variations of a 7-ketone function and a 5,6-double bond in the ring B in the others (131-133, Figure 8 and Table 7).  \n\n\nLathyrane-Type Diterpenoids\n\nLathyranes, named after Euphorbia lathyris, were more often found in species from the Euphorbiaceae other than those in the Thymelaeaceae, especially in the Euphorbia species [86,93].

As for the skeleton with an additional 4,15-bond possessed by 134 and 135, it was believed to be a precursor for crotofolin from Croton corlifolious [86] (Figure 9).

The roots or tubers of Euphorbia are famous for medicinal purposes, especially in China. Many of them, such as Euphorbia pekinensis Rupr, Euphorbia fischeriana Steud and Euphorbia Kansui S.L.Liou ex S.B.Ho. . are used as Chinese herbal medicines. This paper reviews the diterpenoids isolated from the genus Euphorbia species and the pharmacological activities of these compounds to evaluate its traditional use and potential future development. Information on the studies of the genus Euphorbia Linn was collected from scientific journals, books and reports via library and electronic data search (Scifinder, Web of Science, PubMed, Elsevier, Scopus, Google Scholar, Springer, Science Direct, Wiley, ACS, CNKI and Kew Plants of the Word Online). Meanwhile, it was also obtained from published works of material medica, folk records, ethnophmacological literatures, Ph.D. and Masters dissertations. Known as the main constituents of the genus Euphorbia Linn, Diterpenoids possess many pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammation, antiviral activities and cytotoxicity. To date, various types of diterpenoids were identified from this genus, including isopimarane, rosane, abietane, ent-kaurane, ent-atisane. cembrane, casbane, lathyrane, myrsinane, jatropholane, tigliane, ingenane, jatrophane, paraliane, pepluane, and euphoractin. This review describes 14 types of diterpenoid isolated from 45 Euphorbia species from 2012 to 2021, a total of 615 compounds. Among them, mainly include jatrophane (171), lathyrane (92), myrsinane (62), abietane (70), ent-atisane (36), ent-kaurane (7), tigliane (26) and ingenane (19). The possible biological pathways of these compounds were presumed. At the same time, more than 10 biological activities of these compounds were summarized, such as anti-inflammation, antiviral activities and cytotoxicity.",

However, incorporating the enediyne into a 10-membered cyclic hydrocarbon makes the reaction more thermodynamically favorable by releasing the ring strain of the reactants. This allows for the Bergman cyclization to occur at 37 \u00b0C, the biological temperature of humans. Molecules which incorporate enediynes into these larger ring structures have been found to be extremely cytotoxic. Natural products Enediynes are present in many complicated natural products. They were originally discovered in the early 1980s during a search for new anticancer products produced by microorganisms. Calicheamicin was one of the first such products identified and was originally found in a soil sample taken from Kerrville, Texas. These compounds are synthesized by bacteria as defense mechanisms due to their ability to cleave DNA through the formation of 1,4-didehydrobenzene from the enediyne component of the molecule.",

Additionally, in the case of polar bonding, these assumptions necessitate the generation of ionic resonance structures that often overlap with covalent structures. In other words, superfluous resonance structures are calculated for polar molecules. Overall, the Pauling-Wheland formulation of resonance theory was unsuitable for quantitative purposes.

Naturally forming molecular knots are found in organic molecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins. It is not certain that naturally occurring knots are evolutionarily advantageous to nucleic acids or proteins, though knotting is thought to play a role in the structure, stability, and function of knotted biological molecules. The mechanism by which knots naturally form in molecules, and the mechanism by which a molecule is stabilized or improved by knotting, is ambiguous. The study of molecular knots involves the formation and applications of both naturally occurring and chemically synthesized molecular knots. Applying chemical topology and knot theory to molecular knots allows biologists to better understand the structures and synthesis of knotted organic molecules.",

On the basis of its cytotoxicity profile, compound 5 was selected for further biological evaluation, and was found to induce G1 arrest and slow S traverse time in parental wild type p53 A2780S cells, but only G2/M arrest in p53 mutant A2780R cells, with strong apoptosis shown for both cell lines. The activity of 5 was not mediated by the multidrug resistance (MDR) pump, and it was not active against several anticancer molecular targets (i.e., tubulin polymerization/depolymerization, topoisomerases, and DNA intercalation). While these results indicate that compound 5 acts as a cytotoxic agent via a novel mechanism, this substance was inactive in in vivo evaluations using the murine lung carcinoma (M109) and human colon carcinoma (HCT116) models.",

Each model was then tested on another set of plants (\"test\") grown, singly or in pairs, under two watering regimes, one of them different than those of the \"model\" plants. Both sets of plants were grown simultaneously. Models that used only estimates of plant dry mass (ISON [interval by interval size only], and SON [size only]) were outperformed (i.e., the difference between predicted values of final dry mass and their true values were larger on average) by models that incorporated direct measures of water uptake and usage (ISAW [interval by interval size and water], WON [water only], SAW [size and water]).

Previous studies have shown that okadaic acid is a tumor promoter and a specific potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases and protein synthesis. These effects in turn affect intracellular processes such as metabolism, contractility, gene transcription, and the maintenance of cytoskeletal structure. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is a means of maintaining cellular homeostasis in organs, the disruption of which favors tumor cell growth. The GJIC involves the transfer of small water-soluble molecules through intercellular channels (gap junctions), composed of proteins called connexins. OA disrupts cellular homeostasis in Caco-2 cells through several mechanisms including protein synthesis inhibition, apoptosis, and clastogenic effects. The aim of this study was then to evaluate the expression of the connexin 43 (Cx 43) mRNA in relation with the cytotoxicity induced by OA (3.75-60 ng/ml) in a human colonic epithelial cell line in culture (Caco-2 cells). OA produced a dose-dependent inhibition of GJIC in Caco-2 cells, along with a parallel decrease in the expression of Cx 43 as shown by immunohistochemistry using anti-Cx 43 antibody.

Due to its significance to public health and the economy of the fishing industry, many monitoring and control programmes have been implemented [3,4].

These DSP toxins include the polyketide inhibitors okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-4 which are produced by dinoflagellates. Other natural protein phosphatase inhibitors include cyclic peptide inhibitors such as microcystins and nodularins, as well as calyculin and tautomycin (Gupta et al., 1997). The toxins, though structurally dissimilar from one another, all seem to bind at the active site of each phosphatase, where they contact multiple residues near the active site (Suganuma et al., 1989). A free carboxyl and hydroxyl group in the molecule is essential for receptor binding in the case of okadaic acid (see Figure 3). These moieties are important for such compounds to bind to a receptorial site on PP 1 and PP2A, thus inhibiting their activity and interfering with signal transduction processes, including ion channel regulation (Sasaki, K. et al., 1994).  (Catterall, W. A. , 1997).\n\nAs the diarrheic effect of okadaic acid and related toxins has been attributed to the accumulation of phosphorylated proteins that control sodium secretion in intestinal cells, a detection method for such cathartic compounds based on the inhibition of protein phosphatases is of particular interest. Using the specific inhibition of both PPl and PP2A catalytic subunits provides a sensitive method to detect diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. Recently, a highly sensitive fluorometric assay for DSP using PP 1 and PP2A was developed in Dr. Y.",

This work reports the analysis for lipophilic marine biotoxins in shellfish harvested across five regions of Argentina between 1992 and 2012. LC-MS/MS analysis was used for the quantitation of all regulated lipophilic toxins. High concentrations of okadaic acid group toxins were quantified, with a clear dominance of the parent okadaic acid and more than 90% of the toxin present as esters. Results showed DSP toxins in shellfish from the Buenos Aires Province during 2006 and 2007, earlier than previously described. There was also strong evidence linking the presence of okadaic acid to human intoxications. Other lipophilic toxins detected were yessotoxin, pectenotoxin-2 and 13-desMeC spirolide. With evidence published recently for the presence of azaspiracid producers, this work reports the detection of low concentrations of azaspiracid-2 in shellfish. As such the data provides the first published evidence for yessotoxins and azaspiracids in Argentinean shellfish and further evidence for the continuing presence of lipophilic marine toxins in Argentinean waters.

Although DSP is rarely life-threatening, it causes incapacitating diarrhea and vomiting with no known medical treatments. In addition, phytoplankton producing DSP toxins have been identified in temperate coastal waters worldwide, and their numbers may be increasing as a result of coastal eutrophication. The toxic effects of the major DSP toxins, okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-1 (35-methylokadaic acid), appear to originate from their inhibitory activity against a family of structurally related serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PSPases). In particular, the inhibition of essential PSPases (e.g. PP1 and PP2A) has catastrophic consequences in most eukaryonic cells. Exploiting the potent inhibitory property of the DSP toxins, we have developed an enzyme-based assay (PP2A assay) capable of detecting both okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-1 in nanogram amounts. The assay employs purified PP2A, which has an extremely high affinity for both DSP toxins. This provides the PP2A assay with a level of sensitivity comparable to, or surpassing, that of most monoclonal antibody probes. To evaluate the PP2A assay as a means of detecting contaminated shellfish, a series of spike recovery experiments was conducted. The findings from these studies suggest that the PP2A assay has the potential for development into a rapid and relatively simple method for detecting PSPase inhibitors in crude extracts produced from shellfish.",

The responsible toxin, dinophysistoxin 1, has been identified as okadaic acid, a potent phosphatase inhibitor, but its effects on intestinal epithelia have not been examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of okadaic acid on intestinal epithelial function, both Cl- secretion and barrier function. Cultured human intestinal epithelial T84 cell monolayers were used. The effect of okadaic acid on these monolayers was assessed by measuring electrophysiological parameters, lactate dehydrogenase release, and 22Na+ and [3H]mannitol flux rates. Protein phosphorylation studies were performed to identify potentially involved proteins. Okadaic acid does not directly stimulate Cl- secretion from intestinal epithelial cells. On the contrary, the response to well-characterized secretagogues is attenuated by okadaic acid. However, it does decrease transepithelial electrical resistance in a polarized fashion without inducing cytotoxicity. Sodium-mannitol flux studies suggest that the observed decrease in resistance is attributable to an increase in paracellular permeability. Okadaic acid, the toxin responsible for diarrheic shellfish poisoning, does not stimulate Cl- secretion but increases the paracellular permeability of intestinal epithelia. This alteration in intestinal epithelial physiology may contribute to the diarrhea of shellfish poisoning.",

Okadaic acid is held responsible for promoting the tumor on rat skin following local applications and its presence in drinking water induces the formation of tumours in the stomach of rats. Accurate pharmacologica studies have proposed an action mechanism for Okadaic acid and its derivatives, based on inactivation of the function of the tumor suppressor gene function, through hyperphosphorylation, especially at the level of serine and threonine residues, due to inhibition of certain phosphatases. It is likely to result in a build-up of phosphorylated proteins, which are then involved in the promotion of the tumour [10,11].\n\nDSP toxins are stable to heat, although prolonged boiling can decrease the concentration of Okadaic acid within shellfish. Most of the DSP syndromes have occurred in Japan where shellfish cultivation is widespread and along the eastern and western coasts of North America linked to the \"Red Tides\" produced by Dinoflagellates. In fact, in addition to Okadaic acid, responsible for DSP syndrome is Prorocentrum minimum ( Figure 6) an algae that contains Venerupin, a substance of which the structure is not yet known, but harmful for the liver, which has caused shellfish poisoning resulting in gastrointestinal diseases in the humans. This species, in addition to being responsible for many deaths among humans, is responsible for the remarkable killings of shellfish in Japan, in the Gulf of Mexico, in Florida [12][13][14]. This algae, in addition to promoting very large red tides due to its high productivity, is also very resistant to changes in temperature and salinity.

Using this approach, multiple protein phosphatase inhibitor profiles of varying composition were found in diarrhetic mussels from Holland and Canada.

The levels of these inhibitors, in okadaic acid equivalent units, varied from 100 pg to 3350 ng per g shellfish tissue. The combined levels of PP-1/2A inhibitors in all instances superseded that of okadaic acid/dinophysistoxin-1 and may contribute to the diarrhetic shellfish toxin profile of the contaminated mussels. The efficacy of LC-protein phosphatase bioassay was established for cultured phytoplankton where picogram levels of okadaic acid could be detected from microgram extracts of Prorocentrum lima. Analyses of plankton net tows from estuarine mussel culture sites in Eastern Canada revealed a heterogeneous population of protein phosphatase inhibitors, with dinophysistoxin-1 being most prevalent. This toxin was predominant for at least 2 months in mussel populations in the immediate vicinity of plankton sampling sites.

The aptamer with the highest affinity was then used for the fabrication of a label-free electrochemical biosensor for okadaic acid detection. The aptamer was first immobilized on the gold electrode by a self-assembly approach through Au-S interaction. The binding of okadaic acid to the aptamer immobilized on the electrode surface induces an alteration of the aptamer conformation causing a significant decrease in the electron-transfer resistance monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The aptasensor showed a linear range for the concentrations of OA between 100 pg/mL and 60 ng/mL with a detection limit of 70 pg/mL. The dissociation constant of okadaic acid with the aptamer immobilized on the electrode surface showed good agreement with that determined using fluorescence assay in solution. Moreover, the aptasensor did not show cross-reactivity toward toxins with structures similar to okadaic acid such as dinophysis toxin-1 and 2 (DTX-1, DTX-2). Further biosensing applications of the selected aptamers are expected to offer promising alternatives to the traditional analytical and immunological methods for OA detection. ",

The toxins accumulate mainly in the digestive gland (DG) and thus can be assessed by analyzing this tissue [1]. On top of the diarrheagenicity [2], the OAs possesses a tumor promoting activity, aggravating the potential health risks of DSP [3]. Concurrent with the OAs, other toxins called pectenotoxin (PTX), yessotoxin (YTX), and azaspiracids (AZA) often exist in the lipophilic fraction but are recommended not to be included in DSP based on the differences of the mode of actions [4]. As to the source of the toxins, a planktonic dinoflagellate Dinophysis fortii and 7 related species of Dinophysis were first shown to produce OA and DTX1 [5], followed by confirmation of DTX2 in Dinophysis acuta [6,7]. The benthic dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima also produces OAs [8], though its involvement in DSP is arguable. The geographically wide distribution, frequent occurrence, and the important health risks that include potential tumor promotion have made DSP one of the top issues in seafood safety.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the procedure of Usagawa et al. ('DSP-Check' kit) was tested against HPLC. The 'DSP-Check' kit was capable of quantitatively detecting DSP toxins in all the tested contaminated samples containing only okadaic acid, provided that the parent toxins were within the range of detection and were not in the ester form. A high correlation was observed between the two methods when appropriate dilutions were performed. The immunoassay kit tested appeared to be more sensitive, specific and faster than HPLC for determination of DSP in total shellfish meat extracts. No problems were found when using hydrolysed semi-purified extracts in order to detect esters of okadaic acid. In view of the results obtained so far, Donax clams appeared to be an excellent indicator of shellfish contamination with diarrhoeic toxins.

Molecular models for bound motuporin, microcystins, okadaic acid, and calyculin A.\nThe hepatotoxic cyclic heptapeptide microcystins and cyclic pentapeptide nodularins are powerful liver tumor promoters and potent inhibitors of the catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase-1 and -2A (PP-1c and PP-2Ac). In marked contrast to microcystins, which interact covalently with PP-1 and PP-2A, the nodularins do not bind covalently to PP-1 and PP-2A and may additionally possess unique carcinogenic properties. The conformation of microcystin-LR has been determined in solution and bound to PP-1c. We show here that the free NMR solution structures of two distinct microcystin structural congeners (microcystin-LR and -LL) are remarkably similar to the bound crystal structure of microcystin-LR. We have exploited this finding by using Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling to dock the solution structures of microcystin-LL and the marine toxin motuporin (nodularin-V) onto the crystal structure of PP-1c. Both of these toxins occupy a position similar to that of microcystin-LR when bound to PP-1c. However, although there are relatively minor differences in the structural orientation of microcystin-LL compared with microcystin-LR, there is a striking difference in the position of the N-methyldehydrobutyrine residue in motuporin relative to the comparable N-methyldehydroalanine residue in microcystin-LR. We propose that this difference in orientation provides a molecular explanation for why nodularins are incapable of forming a covalent linkage with PP-1c. Furthermore, the predicted position of N-methyldehydrobutyrine in motuporin is at the surface of the PP-1c-toxin complex, which may thus facilitate chemical interaction with a further macromolecule(s) possibly relating to its carcinogenic properties. PP-1c and PP-2Ac are also targets for other marine toxins such as okadaic acid and calyculin A. It was therefore of interest to use Metropolis Monte Carlo modeling to dock the known free crystal structures of okadaic acid and calyculin A to the crystal structure of PP-1c. These experiments predict that both okadaic acid and calyculin A are strikingly similar to microcystins and motuporin in their tertiary structure and relative PP-1c binding position.",

The main diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins are okadaic acid, dinophysistoxin-1, -2, and -3. In vivo, after intraperitoneal injection, dinophysistoxin-2 is approximately 40% less toxic than okadaic acid in mice. The cytotoxic and genotoxic effect of okadaic acid varies very significantly in different cell lines, so similar responses could be expected for dinophysistoxin-2. In order to determine whether this was the case, we studied the effect of okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-2 in two hepatic cell lines (HepG2 and Clone 9). The cytotoxicity of these toxins, as well as their effects on the cell cycle and its regulation on both cell lines, were determined. Okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-2 resulted to be equipotent in clone 9 cultures, while okadaic acid was more potent than dinophysistoxin-2 in HepG2 cell cultures. Both toxins had opposite effects on the cell cycle; they arrested the cell cycle of clone 9 cells in G2/M inducing aberrant mitosis while arresting the cell cycle of HepG2 in G0/G1. When the effect of the toxins on p53 subcellular distribution was studied, p53 was detected in the nuclei of both cell types. The effect of the toxins on the gene expression of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases was different for both cell lines. The toxins induced an increase in gene expression of cyclins A, B, and D in clone 9 cells while they induced a decrease in cyclins A and B in HepG2 cells. They also induced a decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase 1 in HepG2 cells.",

One important way to circumvent toxicity is to store the toxin as an inactive precursor. Several sulfated diesters of the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) toxin okadaic acid have been reported from cultures of various dinoflagellate species belonging to the genus Prorocentrum. It has been proposed that these sulfated diesters are a means of toxin storage within the dinoflagellate cell, and that a putative enzyme mediated two-step hydrolysis of sulfated diesters such as DTX-4 and DTX-5 initially leads to the formation of diol esters and ultimately to the release of free okadaic acid. However, only one diol ester and no sulfated diesters of DTX-1, a closely related DSP toxin, have been isolated leading some to speculate that this toxin is not stored as a sulfated diester and is processed by some other means. DSP components in organic extracts of two large scale Prorocentrum lima laboratory cultures have been investigated. In addition to the usual suite of okadaic acid esters, as well as the free acids okadaic acid and DTX-1, a group of corresponding diol- and sulfated diesters of both okadaic acid and DTX-1 have now been isolated and structurally characterized, confirming that both okadaic acid and DTX-1 are initially formed in the dinoflagellate cell as the non-toxic sulfated diesters.",

The purpose of this work was to determine the variability of OA-group toxins in endemic aquatic organisms (bivalves, crabs, gastropods and fish) and to establish the relationship with the concentration of fatty acids (FAs) detected in the evaluated species.

Its main production problem is the accumulation of toxins during coastal blooms, which prevents mussel commercialization. P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/MDR1/P-gp) is part of the multixenobiotic resistance system in aquatic organisms, and okadaic acid, the main DSP toxin, is probably a substrate of the P-gp-mediated efflux. In this study, the presence and possible role of P-gp in the okadaic acid detoxification process was studied in <iM. galloprovincialis</i. We identified, cloned, and characterized two complete cDNAs of <imdr1</i and <imdr2</i genes. MgMDR1 and MgMDR2 predicted proteins had the structure organization of ABCB full transporters, and were identified as P-gp/MDR/ABCB proteins. Furthermore, the expression of <imdr</i genes was monitored in gills, digestive gland, and mantle during a cycle of accumulation-elimination of okadaic acid. <iMdr1</i significantly increased its expression in the digestive gland and gills, supporting the idea of an important role of the MDR1 protein in okadaic acid efflux out of cells in these tissues. The expression of <iM. galloprovincialis</i<imrp2</i, a multidrug associated protein (MRP/ABCC), was also monitored. As in the case of <imdr1</i, there was a significant induction in the expression of <imrp2</i in the digestive gland, as the content of okadaic acid increased. Thus, P-gp and MRP might constitute a functional defense network against xenobiotics, and might be involved in the resistance mechanisms to DSP toxins.",

These lipophilic toxins accumulate in filter-feeding shellfish and cause an illness in consumers called diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). In 2008, a bloom of Dinophysis led to the closure of shellfish harvesting areas along the Texas coast, one of the first DSP-related closures in the U.S. This event resulted in a broad study of toxin production in isolates of Dinophysis spp. from U.S. waters. In the present study, we compared toxin profiles in geographical isolates of Dinophysis collected in the U.S. (Eel Pond, Woods Hole MA; Martha's Vineyard, MA; and Port Aransas Bay, Texas), and in those from Canada (Blacks Harbour, Bay of Fundy) and Chile (Reloncavi Estuary), when cultured in the laboratory under the same conditions. For each isolate, the mitochondrial cox1 gene was sequenced to assist in species identification. Strains from the northeastern U.S. and Canada were all assigned to Dinophysis acuminata, while those from Chile and Texas were most likely within the D. acuminata complex whereas precise species designation could not be made with this marker. Toxins were detected in all Dinophysis isolates and each isolate had a different profile. Toxin profiles of isolates from Eel Pond, Martha's Vineyard, and Bay of Fundy were most similar, in that they all contained OA, DTX1, and PTX2. The Eel Pond isolate also contained OA-D8 and DTX1-D7, and low levels (unconfirmed structurally) of DTX1-D8 and DTX1-D9. D. acuminata from Martha's Vineyard produced DTX1-D7, along with OA, DTX1, and PTX2, as identified in both the cells and the culture medium. D.\u00a0acuminata from the Bay of Fundy produced DTX1 and PTX2, as found in both cells and culture medium, while only trace amounts of OA were detected in the medium.

From three oceanographic expeditions carried out during autumn, spring and late summer along the Argentine Sea (\u223c38-56\u00b0S), lipophilic phycotoxins were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in size-fractionated plankton samples. Lipophilic toxin profiles were associated with species composition by microscopic analyses of toxigenic phytoplankton. Pectenotoxin-2 and PTX-11 were frequently found together with the presence of Dinophysis acuminata and Dinophysis tripos. By contrast, okadaic acid was rarely detected and only in trace concentrations, and dinophysistoxins were not found. The clear predominance of PTX over other lipophilic toxins in Dinophysis species from the Argentine Sea is in accordance with previous results obtained from north Patagonian Gulfs of the Argentine Sea, and from coastal waters of New Zealand, Chile, Denmark and United States. Dinophysis caudata was rarely found and it was confined to the north of the sampling area. Because of low cell densities, neither D. caudata nor Dinophysis norvegica could be biogeographically related to lipophilic toxins in this study. Nevertheless, the current identification of D. norvegica in the southern Argentine Sea is the first record for the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Given the typical toxigenicity of this species on a global scale, this represents an important finding for future surveillance of plankton-toxin associations.",

OA diol-ester was found to be nearly as toxic as OA. This result contradicted the accepted idea that only the free acid toxins, such as DTX-1 and OA, are potent phosphatase inhibitors. Postassay analyses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of cultures incubated with OA diol-ester showed that the ester had partially decomposed to OA, which explained some but not all of the observed toxicity. The formation of OA during the bioassay raised the possibility that cells exposed to inactive DSP toxin esters could metabolically activate them. This was examined in an additional experiment which showed that the hydrolysis of both DTX-4 and OA diol-ester was spontaneous and apparently not mediated by the presence of T. weissflogii cells. However, cells of T. weissflogii challenged with OA diol-ester rapidly metabolized most of the toxin to a more water-soluble product. From interpretation of mass spectral data obtained using ion-spray LC-MS, the metabolite was identified as an oxygenated diol-ester of OA, implying that it was the product of a monooxygenase-detoxification pathway. It is postulated that OA diol-ester, as a lipid-soluble, uncharged molecule with a propensity to hydrolyse to OA, may facilitate the transfer of OA across cell walls and membranes.",

Zingiber officinale var. rubrum Theilade, locally known in Malaysia as Halia bara, is a widely used spice in Asia. Today, ginger is highly valued for its medicinal properties and it shows an important role in human primary health care worldwide. Ginger contains various phytochemicals and biologically active compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids, 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, and zingerone[4,5]. From among the identified components, shogaols and gingerols were found to be the most abundant bioactive compounds in ginger, having numerous pharmacological benefits, including antioxidant, analgesic, anticancer, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties[6][7][8]. The drying, extraction, storage, and processing steps have a significant impact on the quality of the herbs [9]. Herbal materials must be dried under specified conditions in order to retain their nutritional quality and avoid contamination and deterioration, while medicinal herbs should be dried to protect their phytochemical efficiency[10]. Furthermore, drying also reduces the cost of the final product, as transportation and storage costs are typically determined by product weight. However, the stability of phytochemicals, especially phenolics, are influenced by several factors[11]. Among them, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) plays an important role in the degradation of phenolics and flavonoids of crops. Catalysis of phenolic compounds by PPO has been reported in previous studies[12]. PPO showed variable activity under different storage conditions and its activity is dependent on the drying method of samples, storage, and processing conditions[13,14]. Farmers tend to store rhizomes in underground tunnels, where the maintenance of optimum humidity and temperature control are impossible, and it is difficult and expensive to preserve the ideal drying and storage conditions for ginger rhizomes. This results in spoilage and the ginger roots sprout after a few months. Developing a method for the drying of harvested ginger roots, without any loss in the quality, is therefore very important to ginger growers, ginger-processing personnel, and perennial consumers. Currently, there is little information on the drying of Z. officinale var. rubrum rhizomes in Malaysia. In addition, little is known about the degradation phenolics and flavonoids produced by PPO activities associated with the",

In order to reach the multiple specification targets, various structures have been synthesized and evaluated to select the one demonstrating broad antimicrobial spectrum with favorable environmental profile and application potential to a wide variety of formulas. In order to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized structures, the method of the challenge test consisting in an artificial contamination of the sample with collection microbial strains and evaluation of the number of revivable microorganisms was used to select the most promising candidate. Validation of its antimicrobial potential was later confirmed on Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, yeast and mold with measurement of its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in comparison with known preservatives. Environmental impact assessment of the selected candidate was achieved with the help of ready biodegradability and aquatic ecotoxicity tests performed according to appropriate Organization tes a strfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) guidelinesy. Bio-inspired from turmeric and ginger extracts, an ethylated analog of Zingerone (EZ) with the chemical name 4-(3-ethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)butan-2-one demonstrates the strongest activity on Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Moreover, EZ shows a solubility in water 2 times higher than that of Zingerone thus increasing its interest as a potential preservative. Finally, its assessment of ready biodegradability and aquatic ecotoxicity in OECD-EU tests with a favorable environmental profile confirms its unique interest and fully justifies its use in cosmetic formulas as an eco-respectful preservative. Bio-inspiration based on technologies without noteworthy side effects but also on eco-design, particularly through the use of measures of potential environmental impact very upstream of a development, are two fundamental elements for the launching of new eco-friendly cosmetic ingredients. This approach has thus validated the strong potential of EZ as a preservative of eco-respectful formulas. The selection of EZ is also a very good example of the achievement of two key objectives targeted by cosmetic companies for the development of a novel active ingredient: environmental performance and technical performance.",

It has several types like white ginger variety (Zingiber Officinale Roscoe) which is first implanted in South-East Asia and is one of the most commonly used food flavoring agents, while other types like red ginger and bitter ginger which are less used. Several experimental studies have reported that ginger has gastroprotective effects on the gastric ulcer rat models. [6,7] Zingerone (ZO) is a nontoxic important extract of dry ginger plant (Z. Officinale Roscoe, family: Zingiberaceae) with various medical effects. It has a basic phenolic ring with a methoxy group attached to benzene ring (4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone). ZO is present in a significant amount of about 9.25% in ginger; it cannot be found in fresh ginger while cooking or heating of ginger transforms gingerol to ZO. It is reported that ZO has an anticancer property, strong anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties. Other studies also reported the antioxidant function of ZO.

The rhizome (underground part of the stem) is commonly used as a spice. Apart from its use as spices, it is one of the most utilized herbs in traditional medicine. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family and is closely related to turmeric, cardamom, and galangal. Ginger is used as a spice and flavouring agent worldwide, and it is well-identified for a variety of health benefits, including pharmacological effects, antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, anti-mutagenic, and hepatoprotective. [2][3][4] Phenolic and terpene molecules are among the main active ingredients of ginger. The phenolic constituents of ginger include paradols, shogaols, and gingerols. The most abundant phenolic compounds in fresh ginger are gingerols, such as 6-gingerol, 8-gingerol, and 10-gingerol. 5 Through heat treatment or long-term preservation, the gingerols could be converted to matching shogaols. After the hydrogenation, these shogaols could be converted to paradols. 6 Quercetin, gingerenone-A, zingerone, and 6-dehydrogingerdione are the phenolic compound also found in ginger. Furthermore, ginger contains various terpene components, including \u03b1-curcumene, \u03b1-farnesene, \u03b2-bisabolene, \u03b2-sesquiphellandrene, and zingiberene, which are the significant ingredients of ginger essential oils. 7 In addition to these, ginger contains lipids, polysaccharides, raw fibres and organic acids. 8 The oxidation of biological molecules has been associated with many pathological events such as Parkinson's disease carcinogenesis, atherogenesis and ageing. 9 Oxidative stress occurs when the natural antioxidant capacity of cells is reduced or when the number of reactive oxygen species in organisms increases. 10 It is generally known that free radicals are linked to cell degeneration, particularly in the brain. Consumption of foods high in antioxidants and phytochemicals, on the other hand, may aid in the prevention",

Total synthesis target molecules can be natural products, medicinally-important active ingredients, known intermediates, or molecules of theoretical interest.

The economical benefit of biocomputers lies in this potential of all biologically derived systems to self-replicate and self-assemble given appropriate conditions. For instance, all of the necessary proteins for a certain biochemical pathway, which could be modified to serve as a biocomputer, could be synthesized many times over inside a biological cell from a single DNA molecule. This DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over. This characteristic of biological molecules could make their production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive. Whereas electronic computers require manual production, biocomputers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them.",

Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.",

It usually refers to a process not involving the aid of biological processes, which distinguishes it from semisynthesis. Syntheses may sometimes conclude at a precursor with further known synthetic pathways to a target molecule, in which case it is known as a formal synthesis. Total synthesis target molecules can be natural products, medicinally-important active ingredients, known intermediates, or molecules of theoretical interest. Total synthesis targets can also be organometallic or inorganic, though these are rarely encountered.

                    "contents": "Name: Insulin glargine\nDescription: ['Insulin glargine is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis.  Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin glargine, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.   Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered \"basal insulin\" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting \"bolus insulin\" such as [DB00046], [DB01309], and [DB01306] to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas\\' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.   Insulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or \"follow-on\" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). In 2021, another biosimilar, Semglee (insulin glargine-yfgn), became the first interchangeable (with Lantus) biosimilar insulin to receive FDA approval.  Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.  Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.']",

However, incorporating the enediyne into a 10-membered cyclic hydrocarbon makes the reaction more thermodynamically favorable by releasing the ring strain of the reactants. This allows for the Bergman cyclization to occur at 37 \u00b0C, the biological temperature of humans. Molecules which incorporate enediynes into these larger ring structures have been found to be extremely cytotoxic. Natural products Enediynes are present in many complicated natural products. They were originally discovered in the early 1980s during a search for new anticancer products produced by microorganisms. Calicheamicin was one of the first such products identified and was originally found in a soil sample taken from Kerrville, Texas. These compounds are synthesized by bacteria as defense mechanisms due to their ability to cleave DNA through the formation of 1,4-didehydrobenzene from the enediyne component of the molecule.",

Thiamine availability is also regulated by thiaminases, which are enzymes that readily cleave thiamine molecules and inhibit essential thiamine-regulated pathways such as the metabolism of glucose. Ruminants have working rumen microbes that synthesize thiamine molecules for the body; therefore, ruminants do not need to ingest thiamine rich foods for thiamine. However, feed concentrates given to ruminants, specifically sheep and cattle, are often heavily stocked with thiaminases. The presence of thiaminases counter the production of thiamine by breaking them down, resulting in a futile cycle between rumen microbes and thiaminases. Eventually, when the rate of synthesis production can not exceed thiaminase intake, a state of thiamine deficiency will be reached. Thiaminase rich foods include different grains, fresh water fish, and ferns, all of which are often processed together to make feed concentrate.",

The process begins by producing 7-chloroindole-3-acetamide by treating 7-chloroindole with a series of reagents, shown farther down. This molecule is then glycosylated and reacted with methyl 7-chloroindole-3-glyoxylate to produce an intermediate that goes on to stabilize into the final product.

Oxidase is a general name for enzymes that catalyze oxidations in which molecular oxygen is the electron acceptor but oxygen atoms do not appear in the oxidized product. Often, oxygen is reduced to either water (cytochrome oxidase of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain) or hydrogen peroxide (dehydrogenation of fatty acyl-CoA in peroxisomes). Most of the oxidases are flavoproteins. The name \"mixed-function oxidase\" indicates that the enzyme oxidizes two different substrate simultaneously. Desaturation of fatty acyl-CoA in vertebrates is an example of the mixed-function oxidase reaction. In the process, saturated fatty acyl-CoA and NADPH are oxidized by molecular oxygen (O2) to produce monounsaturated fatty acyl-CoA, NADP+ and 2 molecules of water. Reaction",

The biosynthesis of OEA and other bioactive lipid amides is modulated by bile acids. OEA has been demonstrated to bind to the novel cannabinoid receptor GPR119. OEA has been suggested to be the receptor's endogenous ligand. OEA has been reported to lengthen the life span of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans through interactions with lysomal molecules.

This generation tool can be combined with workflows for the screening of large numbers of molecules on the basis of computed molecular properties that fulfill certain criteria. We applied such a workflow to find molecules with potential to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs, using desirable optical properties as selection criteria. Results are shown for NDI's, PDI's, PTI1's, and PTI2's derivatives. The derivatives create a very diverse set of chromophores allowing panchromatic sensitization of the photoelectrode if adsorbed together on a semiconductor surface. The outcome is around 1400 derivatives that fulfill the criteria to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs. The workflow applied to NDI selects already known sensitizers out of 1015 structures, which shows its reliability. We also considered estimating the GSOP and ESOP by HOMO/ LUMO energy levels but observed that this simple procedure based on DFT(CAM-B3LYP) values is not predictive enough for this purpose.

Of which, starfish are benthic organisms widely found in all oceans. Starfish have attracted organic chemists, biochemists, and pharmacologists as a fascinating source of bioactive secondary metabolites especially polyhydroxylated steroids and steroidal glycosides. 1,2) Polyhydroxylated steroids from starfish comprise four to nine hydroxy groups in steroidal nucleus and side chains.

[1][2][3] The starfish Archaster typicus is abundantly found in Vietnamese seas. Previous studies on this species yielded nine unique polyhydroxylated steroids in the 1980s. [4][5][6] Recently, several polyhydroxylated steroids of this type 7,8) and asterosaponins 9,10) were reported from this species. In continuation of our recent investigations on Vietnamese starfish, 11) this paper deals with the isolation and structure elucidation of eight highly hydroxylated steroids (1-8, Fig. 1), including three new compounds 1-3, from A. typicus.\n\n\nResults and Discussion",

In the present study, we amputate portions of the arms of Archaster typicus starfish, extract and separate the active biomaterials, and compare the effects of each fraction on in vitro wound healing and in vivo lower jaw regeneration of zebrafish. Compared with crude extract, normal hexane fractions (NHFs) have a remarkable effect on cellular proliferation and collective migration, and exhibit fibroblast-like morphology, while methanol-water fractions (MWFs) increase cell size, cell-cell adhesion, and cell death. Relative to moderate mitochondrialand lysosomal aggregation in NHFs-cultured cells, MWFs-cultured cells contain more and bigger lysosomal accumulations and clump detachment. The in vivo zebrafish lower jaw regeneration model reveals that NHFs enhance blastema formation and vasculogenesis, while MWFs inhibit fibrogenesis and induce cellular transformation. Gene expression analyses indicate that NHFs and MWFs separately activate blastema-characteristic genes as well as those genes-related to autophagy, proteasome, and apoptosis either during cell scratch healing or ganciclovir-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that bioactive compounds from NHFs and MWFs could induce blastema formation and remodeling, respectively, and prevent tissue overgrowth.",

Along highly urbanised coasts, loss of sandy habitats through land reclamation and degradation of adjacent mangrove forests and seagrass meadows, which serve as nurseries for <iA. typicus</i, could lead to local extinction of this species. To determine the population status of <iA. typicus</i in Singapore, we performed belt-transect surveys at three modified shores, then compared size structure, clustering patterns and ontogenetic shifts within the Central Indo-Pacific region. We found that <iA. typicus</i individuals were, among other things, larger in Singapore (79.2 \u00b1 14.2 mm) than the rest of the Central Indo-Pacific region with further differences amongst Singapore's sites. Sea stars of this species were also greatly clustered in smaller areas within the transects, with most transects presenting small Nearest Neighbour Index values of &lt; 1. While ontogenetic shifts were noted in previous studies, no juveniles have been recorded in the nursery habitats of mangroves and seagrasses, with limited size and mating seasonalities. Although <iA. typicus</i appears to have grown in size considerably on reclaimed beaches in Singapore, the lack of any apparent ontogenetic connectivity here may threaten the sea star populations in the near future, particularly in the context of growing coastal development in Southeast Asia.",

For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction.

The chiral information is most commonly contained in a catalyst and, in this case, the information in a single molecule of catalyst may be transferred to many substrate molecules, amplifying the amount of chiral information present. Similar processes occur in nature, where a chiral molecule like an enzyme can catalyse the introduction of a chiral centre to give a product as a single enantiomer, such as amino acids, that a cell needs to function.

In either case, the rate of the reaction or step is described by the first order rate law where [A] is the concentration of species A, t is time, and kr is the reaction rate constant. As can be deduced from the rate law equation, the number of A molecules that decay is proportional to the number of A molecules available. An example of a unimolecular reaction, is the isomerization of cyclopropane to propene: Unimolecular reactions can be explained by the Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism. Bimolecular reactions In a bimolecular reaction, two molecules collide and exchange energy, atoms or groups of atoms. This can be described by the equation",

It took around 15 years until another molecule with a similar mechanism was found. In more recent years, the molecules that have been discovered have differing structures from Taxol, however the mechanisms still remain to be similar. One in particular is called, discodermolide. Dr. Horwitz and her team were interested in not only the binding site for the molecule on the microtubule, but also the possible allosteric effects that the molecule may have on other parts of the microtubule. In order to test for these effects, the team used a hydrogen-deuterium exchange process. The results showed that there was in fact several changes that occurred along the microtubule separate from the binding site when the molecule was bound. They found that normal microbtubule-associated proteins, or MAPs, were not able to bind to the microtubules in the normal way.",

As a result of their stability, it is very difficult to cause aromatic molecules to break apart and to react with other substances.

The structure of the hexasaccharide is DeltaUAp2S(1--&gt;4)-alpha-D-GlcNpAc6S(1--&gt;4)-beta-D-GlcAp++ +(1--&gt;4)-alpha- D-GlcNpS3S6S(1--&gt;4)-alpha-L-IdoAp(1--&gt;4)-alpha-D-GlcNpS6S . The octasaccharide and decasaccharide correspond to the predominant structural motif found in porcine intestinal mucosal heparin. Sufficient quantities of the decasaccharide were obtained to examine its interaction with antithrombin III using microtitration calorimetry. This decasaccharide bound to antithrombin III with similar avidity as heparin and showed comparable anticoagulant activity, as determined using an antithrombin III dependent anti-factor Xa assay. Interestingly, while both decasaccharide and heparin bound to antithrombin with nanomolar affinity, very little heat of binding was observed.",

The resulting, radiolabelled-disaccharides and -tetrasaccharides were isolated by gel chromatography, and then fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography, paper chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. Of the nine disaccharides isolated and identified, eight were probably derived from the major repeating-disaccharide unit in heparin (2-deoxy-2-sulfoamino-D-glucosyl 6-sulfate leads to L-idosyluronic acid 2-sulfate). Sodium borotritide reduction and/or HNO2 deamination of these eight disaccharide fractions indicated four to contain L-idopyranose residues and the other four to contain 1,6-anhydro-L-idopyranose residues as terminal units. The latter, terminal unit probably represents a minor component formed during the acid hydrolysis. On the basis of N-acetylation, N-sulfation, and HNO2-deamination studies, and the known positions and configurations of the glycosidic and sulfate linkages in heparin, four disaccharides were identified as 0-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose, 0-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glycopyranosyl)-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose 2-sulfate, and 0-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl 6-sulfate]-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose 2-sulfate. A similar set of four disaccharides contained 1,6-anhydro-L-[6-3H]idopyranose residues in place of the L-[6-3H]idopyranose residues. The other disaccharide was tentatively identified as 0-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose, the isolation of which suggests the presence of an IdA(OSO-3)-GlcNAc-IdA(OSO-3) sequence in the heparin preparation, which accounts for at least 1% of its total sequence. The tetrasaccharides were fractionated, on the basis of their sulfate content, into at least five species by ion-exchange chromatography or by paper electrophoresis. These were fractionated further into species with and without carboxyl groups, and with L-idopyranose or 1,6-anhydro-L-idopyranose residues as terminal units. Tentative structures for some of these tetrasaccharides are proposed. Disaccharide and tetrasaccharide species were evaluated before and after N-acetylation or N-sulfation, as substrates for sulfamidase, acetyl-CoA: 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucoside N-acetyl-transferase, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosidase, or 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-sulfate sulfatase in human-skin fibroblasts.",

Peptide autoinducers usually result from posttranslational modification of a larger precursor molecule. In many Gram-positive bacteria, secretion of peptides requires specialized export mechanisms. For example, some peptide autoinducers are secreted by ATP-binding cassette transporters that couple proteolytic processing and cellular export. Following secretion, peptide autoinducers accumulate in extracellular environments. Once a threshold level of signal is reached, a histidine sensor kinase protein of a two-component regulatory system detects it and a signal is relayed into the cell. As with AHLs, the signal ultimately ends up altering gene expression. Unlike some AHLs, however, most oligopeptides do not act as transcription factors themselves.",

In addition, with ab initio calculations the propensity of ligand hydration was evaluated. Based on this information, we developed an algorithm (AcquaAlta) to reproduce water molecules bridging polar interactions between ligand and protein moieties. This approach was validated with 20 crystal structures and yielded a match of 76% between experimental and calculated water positions. When water molecules establishing only weak interactions with the protein were neglected, the match could be improved to 88%. Supported by a pharmacophore-based alignment tool, the solvation algorithm was then applied to the docking of oligopeptides to the periplasmic oligopeptide binding protein A (OppA).

This scheme reflects the fact that achieving desirable effects with respect to one of the properties can negatively impact upon other properties. For example, molecular features such as polar groups on a plasticizer are attracted to polar sites on the PVC molecule and will render the plasticizer more compatible with PVC; however, if only polar components are present in a plasticizer, its plasticizing effectiveness is not very high. Conversely, the non-polar segments of the molecule generally provide good plasticization, but if they are too large or numerous, the plasticizer might be poorly miscible with PVC and lead to exudation. This careful balancing act of optimizing plasticizer performance has been the primary focus of research and development work for many years. However, given the significant negative impacts of phthalate plasticizers noted above, in this review we endeavor to outline approaches to plasticizer design and evaluation that also incorporate elements of green chemistry thinking, in addition to traditional performance considerations [23,24]. Therefore, the schematic shown in Figure 1 reflects the inherent and growing importance of maintaining plasticizer performance while considering green design elements such as toxicity, biodegradation, and leaching in developing safe and effective plasticizers. In order to answer the question \"how green is your plasticizer?\", we need to not only ensure that compounds meet the balanced criteria of an effective plasticizer, but we must assess the effects of the plasticizer from non-traditional measures, informed by green chemistry, shown in Figure 1. At its core, the growing field of green chemistry aims to reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. This applies not only during the usage stage of a material, but also includes its production and end-of-life stages. A crucial component of green chemistry is thus the design stage, during which much of the future fate of a molecule or substance is already decided.

Such a large (ideally exhaustive) collection of polymers would be particularly powerful in conjunction with machine learning and numerical simulation techniques, as a way to facilitate complicated tasks like human-guided molecular exploration [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] , property prediction [13][14][15][16][17] , and retro-synthesis [18,19] . Computational approaches based on chemical representations and generated data [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] have also tremendously reduced the time, cost, and resources spent on physical synthesis in the chemistry lab [28][29][30][31] .\n\nIdeally, a chemical design model would include three components: (1) a well-defined representation capable of capturing known structures, (2) a generative model capable of enumerating all structures in a given class, and (3) an inverse modeling procedure capable of translating known molecular structures into the representation. For a given class of molecules, an ideal chemical design model should satisfy the following five criteria: i. Complete: representation is able to encode all possible structures in the given class. ii. Explicit: representation directly specifies the molecular structure. iii. Valid: every generated output is a physically valid chemical structure in the given class. iv. Explainable: the generation process is understandable to the user. v. Invertible: the inverse procedure can translate molecular structures into the given representation. However, designing a chemical model that meets all these criteria is challenging, especially for structurally complex molecules. Most existing approaches are limited to small, simple chemical structures [32][33][34][35][36] . Even with this limited scope, the design is labor intensive: the representation language is typically developed first, then extended for generation and inverse modeling. In particular, there have been many systems for molecular line notations [32,33] and fragment-level description [34,35] , which were then used as the basis for generative and inverse schemes [5][6][7][8] .",

Each study was assessed based on the following parameters: (I) description of sample size, (II) presence of a control group, (III) blinded assessment of the experimental outcome, (IV) adequately addressing outcome data, (V) standardized sample preparation, and (VI) inclusion of a conflict-of-interest statement. A score of 0 was assigned to a criterion for a study if it was clearly reported, a score of 1 was assigned to a criterion if it was vague or insufficiently reported, and a score of 2 was assigned to a criterion if the information was not present. The six criterion scores for each study were then summed to obtain a cumulative score. Articles that were at low risk of bias scored between 0-3, moderate risk of bias scored between 4-8, and high risk of bias scored between 9-12. Finally, any disagreements between the two authors during the evaluation were later discussed and a consensus was reached.\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability (IRR)\n\nAn inter-rater reliability (IRR) test for the risk of bias assessment was performed using a kappa calculator on SPSS Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) following the procedure outlined by McHugh [94]. Percent user agreement was calculated by taking the number of studies given the same risk of bias designations by both authors and dividing it by the total number of studies. To obtain the percent of data that are reliable, the kappa values were squared. From these percentages, a level of agreement was described for each parameter using [94].\n\n\nResults\n\n\nSearch and Selection\n\nA total of 1279 potentially relevant records were identified from the databases, grey literature, and reference search ( Figure 1). After removing the duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 707 records were examined. Then, 631 studies were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria, and 76 articles were assessed by full-text reading.

[134]ipinski's rule of five considers factors such as MW, lipophilicity, hydrogen bond donors, and hydrogen bond acceptors.The rule suggests that compounds meeting certain criteria are more likely to be absorbed effectively when taken orally, resulting in adequate oral BA.However, peptides are fundamentally different from small molecule drugs regarding size and MW, structure, hydrophilicity, and degradation, placing them outside the boundaries of this rule. [135]Lipinski's rule is primarily designed for molecules with MW < 500 Da, whereas many peptides have MW well above this threshold.Peptides often contain numerous polar and hydrophilic functional groups, including multiple amino acid residues with polar side chains.In contrast, Lipinski's rule emphasizes the importance of lipophilicity for oral absorption, the inherent high hydrophilicity of many peptide drugs can hinder permeation over the epithelial barrier.Overall, peptides face unique challenges when it comes to oral delivery, and predicting their oral BA requires considering factors specific to peptide chemistry, such as strategies to protect them from enzymatic degradation and enhance their transport across the intestinal barrier.[138] For example, the cyclic peptide cyclosporin A is known to change its conformation depending on its solvent environment.This conformational flexibility seems to be key for the unusually high membrane permeability of cyclosporin A and other membrane-permeable cyclic peptides.Indeed, conformationally constrained variants of those peptides have shown limited movement into, through, and finally out of the cellular membrane. [139]On the other hand, there are examples of orally available linear peptides, that are either already on the market or in clinical trials, proving that the cyclic structure is no prerequisite.However, it is noteworthy to state that most of these linear peptides are rather small (\u2264 1000 Da), and/or peptidomimetics.For larger and more complex ones (> 1000 Da and < 5000 Da) co-formulation with PEs is needed to achieve therapeutic plasma levels. [25]ven if conventional criteria cannot be applied directly, there are certain peptide characteristics that favor the successful development of oral formulations, especially when formulated with suitable PEs.In the following section, we outline the key features that peptides should possess to be suitable for the oral route (Table 2).",

In particular, in a many-electron molecule, an orbital is not the total stationary state of the molecule, but rather the stationary state of a single electron within the molecule. This concept of an orbital is only meaningful under the approximation that if we ignore the electron-electron instantaneous repulsion terms in the Hamiltonian as a simplifying assumption, we can decompose the total eigenvector of a many-electron molecule into separate contributions from individual electron stationary states (orbitals), each of which are obtained under the one-electron approximation.

One of the common examples of such assemblies are Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers and multilayers of surfactants. Non-surface active molecules can assemble into ordered structures as well. Early direct proofs showing that non-surface active molecules can assemble into higher-order architectures at solid interfaces came with the development of scanning tunneling microscopy and shortly thereafter. Eventually two strategies became popular for the self-assembly of 2D architectures, namely self-assembly following ultra-high-vacuum deposition and annealing and self-assembly at the solid-liquid interface. The design of molecules and conditions leading to the formation of highly-crystalline architectures is considered today a form of 2D crystal engineering at the nanoscopic scale.",

Since Huber-Morath's groups are not taxonomical, M\u00fcrbeck's treatment is the most current one available, as no study has yet sought to apply genetic or molecular data extensively to the genus. In M\u00fcrbeck's classification, V. thapsus is placed in section Bothrospermae subsect. Fasciculata (or sect. Verbascum subsect.

Metronidazole is used as routine treatment of disease. Some reports have confirmed the potential carcinogenic and teratogenic effects of this drug on fetus and indication of drug resistance. Verbascum thapsus belongs to the family of Scorphulariaceae. Its antiinflammatory properties, disinfectant and skin healing effects are well known. This plant has been used to treat diarrhea and genitourinary infection in traditional medicine. Effects of different concentrations of the Verbascum thapsus extract were tested on the growth and motility of T. vaginalis trophozoites. To evaluate the toxicity of extract, their effects on mice macrophages were measured by MTT([3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazolyl-2)- 2,5-diphenyle tetrazolium bromide ])assay. In this experimental study the effect of Verbascum thapsus ethanol extract on induction apoptosis in T. vaginalis was determined by Flow Cytometry. Results were analyzed by Flow Jo software and the degree of apoptosis was determined. Toxicity percentage of 25-800 \u03bcg/ml concentrations of Verbascum thapsus alcoholic extract for mice macrophages was observed between 0.17-0.25 after 12 hours and they were between 0.25-0.42 and0.45-0.95 after 24 and 48h respectively. IC50 (inhibitory concentration, 50%) of Verbascum thapsus ethanol extract and metronidazole after 24h was 39.17 and 0.0326 \u03bcg/ml respectively. Flow cytometry results showed the percent of apoptosis following treatment of trophozoites with different concentrations of Verbascum thapsus ethanol extract (25, 50,100,200,400 \u03bcg/ml), were 20.7, 37.04, 47.5, 62.72 and 86.35 respectively, while in control group was 2.9. According to this study, Verbascum thapsus extract induces programmed death in T. vaginalis. It is recommended that Verbascum thapsus extract can be considered as a suitable choice for Medical Studies. ",

(Scrophulariaceae) from the Etnean area (Sicily, Italy) was performed in order to verify their possible presence. Wild V. thapsus is well-known in ethnopharmacology due to the several beneficial effects that it is able to exert and which are primarily due to these compounds. So, it's extremely important that also cultivated exemplars of this species biosynthesize them in order to maintain their pharmacological properties. This study revealed the presence of seven PhGs in an unusual novel pattern. Thus, this exemplar is a very good potential source of this class of natural products and may be employed for several beneficial ethnopharmacological purposes.",

Therefore, the present study was aimed to determine the level of heavy metals in soil and water samples of this area. The wild plant growing (nine native plants: Pteris vittata, Populus nigra, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Persicaria maculosa, Arundo donax, Xanthium strumarium, Verbascum thapsus, Ricinus communis and Parthenium hysterophorus) there were then tested for their phytoremediation capabilities which is an environmentally friendly, generally utilized, and low-cost approach to eliminate heavy metals from polluted soils and water. Soil, water, and effluent samples were taken from the contaminated sites of seven steel mills in Dargai District Malakand and subjected to heavy metals analysis. Based on bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) calculated, The highest BCF for zinc was recorded for Pteris vittata roots (3.93), while the lowest value was observed for Verbascum thapsus leaves (0.306). Pteris vittata root showed the highest BCF for iron (1.618), while Ricinus communis leaves showed the lowest (0.023). The highest BCF value for chromium was highest for Populus nigra roots (0.717), while the lowest value was recorded for Persicaria maculosa leaves (0.031). For the selected metals; Fe, Zn and Cr the highest TF were recorded for Pteris vittata (0.988), Verbascum thapsus (0.944) and Xanthium strumairum (0.968) respectively. Therefore, it is recommended that these plants should be grown near to steel mills to reclaim heavy metals from industrial effluent, polluted soil as well as from polluted water.",

There is not much data, to our knowledge, in this respect. The antioxidant activities of V. Thapsus were investigated by the DPPH (2, 2- diphenyl- 1-picrylhydrazyl) method. Using GC-MS, the presence of different anticarcinogenic products including 1-hexzanol (2.11%), 2-hexene (1.95%), etc. was determined in the ethanolic extract of V. Thapsus. The antimicrobial activities of V. Thapsus were determined by the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods using the Grampositive and -negative bacterial strains. The least concentration of V. Thapsus L. ethanolic extract (50 mg/l) resulted in only 21.26% inhibition of DPPH free radicals, however, the concentrations of 300 mg/l resulted in almost the highest inhibition (91.31%) of DPPH free radicals. The antioxidant activities of synthesized antioxidant BHT at the concentration of 300 mg/l or higher were similar to the antioxidant activities of V. Thapsus L. ethanolic extract. Both the isolated and the standard Gram-negative bacterial strains were more tolerant to the V. Thapsus ethanolic extract, compared with the Grampositive bacterial strains. Bacillus cereus was the most sensitive bacterial strain among the tested bacterial strains. The medicinal plant V. Thapsus L. can be used for the treatment of different diseases, such as cancer and infectious diseases.",

Distribution and habitat Hydrocoytle sibthorpioides is most commonly found in southeastern Asia. Although is native to Asia, there are parts of the United States where this plant thrives as an introduced species, particularly in the eastern US, and some areas in California. Recently, H. sibthorpioides has been reported to flourish in southeast Australia, where it occurs in Brisbane and Sydney. However this plant is not found in Western Australia. This species is able to grow in a wide variety of habitats, from dry areas to locations which are occasionally submerged. It can also be found between sidewalk cracks, and is increasingly occurring as a lawn weed.",

The aim of this study is to isolate and identify an anti-HBV compound from this herb. A compound (saponin) was isolated from the active ethanol extract using bioassay-guided screening. The structure of the saponin was elucidated by spectroscopic methods and compared with published data. The anti-HBV activity of the saponin was evaluated by detecting the levels of HBV antigens, extracellular HBV DNA, nuclear covalent closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and five HBV promoters in HepG2.2.15 cells. In addition, the levels of serum HBsAg/HBeAg, DHBV DNA, ALT/AST and hepatic pathological changes were analyzed in DHBV-infected ducks. The chemical analysis indicated that the saponin isolated from Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides is asiaticoside. The pharmacodynamics experimental studies showed that asiaticoside effectively suppressed the levels of HBsAg/HBeAg, extracellular HBV DNA and intracellular cccDNA in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that asiaticoside markedly reduced viral DNA transcription and replication by inhibiting the activities of core, s1, s2, and X gene promoters. In addition, asiaticoside markedly reduced DHBV replication without any obvious signs of toxicity. The levels of serum DHBV DNA, HBsAg/HBeAg were increased 3 days after drug withdrawal, but the levels rebounded slightly in the asiaticoside treatment groups compared with the 3TC treatment group. Moreover, analysis of the serum ALT/AST levels and the liver pathological changes indicated that asiaticoside could alleviate liver damage. Our results show that asiaticoside could efficiently inhibit HBV replication both in vitro and in vivo, and asiaticoside may be a major bioactive ingredient in Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides.",

However, little is known about the effects of spatial patchiness and temporal heterogeneity in water on growth and clonal integration between congeneric invasive and native Hydrocotyle species. In a greenhouse experiment, we subjected severed or no severed (intact) fragments of Hydrocotyle vulgaris, a highly invasive species in China, and its co-existing, native congener H. sibthorpioides to different spatial patchiness (homogeneous and patchy) and temporal interval (low and high interval) in water supply. Clonal integration had significant positive effects on growth of both species. In the homogeneous water conditions, clonal integration greatly improved the growth in fragments of both species under low interval in water. However, in the patchy water conditions, clonal integration significantly increased growth in both ramets and fragments of H. vulgaris under high interval in water. Therefore, spatial patchiness and temporal interval in water altered the effects of clonal integration of both species, especially for H. vulgaris. The adaptation of H. vulgaris might lead to invasive growth and potential spread under the global water variability.",

To investigate the potential effect of Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides Lam. (H. sibthorpioides) extracts against in vitro dengue viral replication. Methods. The cytotoxicity of H. sibthorpioides was evaluated using a cell viability assay. Cells were pre- and posttreated with water and methanol extracts of H. sibthorpioides, and the viral inhibitory effect was investigated by observing the morphological changes, which were further confirmed by plaque assay. Results. The methanolic extract cytotoxicity was higher in Vero and C6/36 cells than the cytotoxicity of the water extract. Preincubation of the cells with H. sibthorpioides extract showed nonexistent to mild prophylactic effects. The posttreatment of Vero cells with H. sibthorpioides methanolic extract presented higher antidengue activities when compared with the water extract. Surprisingly, posttreatment of C6/36 cells resulted in an enhancement of viral replication. Conclusion. H. sibthorpioides had variable effects on dengue viral replication, depending on the treatment, cell lines, and solvent types. This study provides important novel insights on the phytomedicinal properties of H. sibthorpioides extracts on dengue virus. ",

Also, our results indicate that the H. sibthorpioides extract promoted the thymus and spleen indices, and humoral immunity of mice. These observations demonstrated that H. sibthorpioides exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the growth of tumors, in addition to mediating immunomodulatory effects in mice.",

Hypoxic cancer cells are known to be resistant to radio- and chemo-therapy. New therapeutic strategies specifically targeting these cells are needed. Plant extracts used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can offer promising candidates. Despite their widespread usage, information on their effects in hypoxic conditions is still lacking. In this study, we examined the cytotoxicity of a series of known TCM plant extracts under normoxic versus hypoxic conditions. Pereskia grandifolia, Orthosiphon aristatus, Melastoma malabathricum, Carica papaya, Strobilanthes crispus, Gynura procumbens, Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides, Pereskia bleo and Clinacanthus nutans leaves were dried, blended into powder form, extracted in methanol and evaporated to produce crude extracts. Human Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells were treated with various concentrations of the plant extracts under normoxia or hypoxia (0.5% oxygen). 24h after treatment, an MTT assay was performed and the IC(50) values were calculated. Effect of the extracts on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) activity was evaluated using a hypoxia-driven firefly luciferase reporter assay. The relative cytotoxicity of each plant extract on Saos-2 cells was different in hypoxic versus normoxic conditions. Hypoxia increased the IC(50) values for Pereskia grandifola and Orthosiphon aristatus extracts, but decreased the IC(50) values for Melastoma malabathricum and Carica papaya extracts. Extracts of Strobilanthes crispus, Gynura procumbens, Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides had equivalent cytotoxic effects under both conditions. Pereskia bleo and Clinacanthus nutans extracts were not toxic to cells within the concentration ranges tested. The most interesting result was noted for the Carica papaya extract, where its IC(50) in hypoxia was reduced by 3-fold when compared to the normoxic condition. This reduction was found to be associated with HIF inhibition. Hypoxia variably alters the cytotoxic effects of TCM plant extracts on cancer cells. Carica papaya showed enhanced cytotoxic effect on hypoxic cancer cells by inhibiting HIF activities. These findings provide a plausible approach to killing hypoxic cancer cells in solid tumors.",

The flowers are a faint yellow with a hint of purple. Flower clusters are simple and flat-topped or rounded. There are inconspicuous involucral bracts at the base of each flower and indistinct sepals. The leaves are simple, with small leafy outgrowth at the base, kidney-shaped to round. Leaf edges are scalloped. The leaves of H. sibthorpioides are broad and alternate. The peltate leaves are often described as egg-shaped; all of the leaves are hairless and they often have five to seven shallow lobes around the edge. H. sibthorpioides has fruits that are flat, and that break in half when the plant reaches maturity. Once the fruit has broken open, there is one seed on each side. The fruits are elliptical to round with thin ridges and no oil tubes (vitta), which is characteristic in the fruit of umbelliferous plants.",

This series of compounds with a 3-oxoisoindoline-4-carboxamide core structure, displayed modest to good activity against PARP-1 in both intrinsic and cellular assays. SAR studies at the lactam nitrogen of the pharmacophore have suggested that a secondary or tertiary amine is important for cellular potency. An X-ray structure of compound 1e bound to the protein confirmed the formation of a seven-membered intramolecular hydrogen bond. Though revealed previously in peptides, this type of seven-membered intramolecular hydrogen bond is rarely observed in small molecules. Largely due to the formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond, the 3-oxoisoindoline-4-carboxamide core structure appears to be planar in the X-ray structure. An additional hydrogen bond interaction of the piperidine nitrogen to Gly-888 also contributes to the binding affinity of 1e to PARP-1.",

The stability of the molecule arising from hyper-conjugative interaction and charge delocalization has been analyzed using NBO analysis. From the NBO analysis it is evident that the increased electron density at the nitrogen, carbon atoms leads to the elongation of respective bond length and a lowering of the corresponding stretching wave number. The calculated geometrical parameters are in agreement with that of similar derivatives. The calculated first hyperpolarizability is high and the calculated data suggest an extended \u03c0-electron delocalization over the pyrazine ring and carboxamide moiety which is responsible for the nonlinearity of the molecule.

Four compounds possessed in vitro whole cell activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv that was at least equivalent to that of the standard pyrazinamide. MIC values ranged from 6 to 42 \u03bcM. The best MIC (6 \u03bcM) was displayed by 3-[(4-methylbenzyl)amino]pyrazine-2-carboxamide (8) that also showed low cytotoxicity in the HepG2 cell line (IC50 \u2265 250 \u03bcM). Only moderate activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus was observed. No activity was detected against any of tested fungal strains. Molecular docking with mycobacterial enoyl-ACP reductase (InhA) was performed to investigate the possible target of the prepared compounds. Active compounds shared common binding interactions of known InhAinhibitors. Antimycobacterial activity of the title compounds was compared to the previously published benzylamino-substituted pyrazines with differing substitution on the pyrazine core (carbonitrile moiety).

In this study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a flavonoid glucosyltransferase (GT) from Dianthus caryophyllus (carnation) was investigated as a whole-cell biocatalyst. Two yeast expression systems were compared using the flavonoid naringenin as a model substrate. Under in vitro conditions, naringenin-7-O-glucoside was formed and a higher specific glucosyl transfer activity was found using a galactose inducible expression system compared to a constitutive expression system. However, S. cerevisiae expressing the GT constitutively was significantly more productive than the galactose inducible system under in vivo conditions. Interestingly, the glycosides were recovered directly from the culture broth and did not accumulate intracellularly. A previously uncharacterized naringenin glycoside formed using the D. caryophyllus GT was identified as naringenin-4'-O-glucoside. It was found that S. cerevisiae cells hydrolyze naringenin-7-O-glucoside during whole-cell biocatalysis, resulting in a low final glycoside titer. When phloretin was added as a substrate to the yeast strain expressing the GT constitutively, the natural product phlorizin was formed. This study demonstrates S. cerevisiae is a promising whole-cell biocatalyst host for the production of valuable glycosides.",

In recent research projects, chemogenetics has been widely used to understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Prior to chemogenetics, researchers used methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.",

Epidemiologic and experimental evidence indicates a protective effect of phytoestrogens also in colorectal cancer. The mechanism through which estrogenic molecules control colorectal cancer tumorigenesis could possibly involve estrogen receptor beta, the predominantly expressed estrogen receptor subtype in colon mucosa.To validate this hypothesis, we therefore used an engineered human colon cancer cell line induced to overexpress estrogen receptor beta, beside its native cell line, expressing very low levels of ERbeta and not expressing ERalpha; as a phytoestrogenic molecule, we used kaempferide triglycoside, a glycosylated flavonol from a Dianthus caryophyllus cultivar. The inhibitory properties of this molecule toward vegetal cell growth have been previously demonstrated: however, no data on its activity on animal cell or information about the mechanism of this activity are available. Kaempferide triglycoside proved to inhibit the proliferation of native and estrogen receptor beta overexpressing colon cancer cells through a mechanism not mediated by ligand binding dependent estrogen receptor activation. It affected HCT8 cell cycle progression by increasing the G(0)/G(1) cell fraction and in estrogen receptor beta overexpressing cells increased two antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, the biological effects of this kaempferide triglycoside were strengthened by the presence of high levels of estrogen receptor beta.Pleiotropic molecular effects of phytoestrogens may explain their protective activity against colorectal cancer and may represent an interesting area for future investigation with potential clinical applications.",

DcACS1, which encodes 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS), is a gene involved in this phenomenon. We determined the genomic DNA structure of DcACS1 by genomic PCR. In the genome of 'Light Pink Barbara', we found two distinct nucleotide sequences: one corresponding to the gene previously shown as DcACS1, designated here as DcACS1a, and the other novel one designated as DcACS1b. It was revealed that both DcACS1a and DcACS1b have five exons and four introns. These two genes had almost identical nucleotide sequences in exons, but not in some introns and 3'-UTR. Analysis of transcript accumulation revealed that DcACS1b is expressed in senescing petals as well as DcACS1a. Genomic PCR analysis of 32 carnation cultivars showed that most cultivars have only DcACS1a and some have both DcACS1a and DcACS1b. Moreover, we found two DcACS1 orthologous genes with different nucleotide sequences from D. superbus var. longicalycinus, and designated them as DsuACS1a and DsuACS1b. Petals of D. superbus var. longicalycinus produced ethylene in response to exogenous ethylene, accompanying accumulation of DsuACS1 transcripts. These data suggest that climacteric ethylene production in flowers was genetically established before the cultivation of carnation.",

In this study, we evaluated the potential for yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to be used as a catalyst for the synthesis of tranilast and various tranilast analogs (cinnamoyl anthranilates). Several studies have demonstrated that these phenolic amides have antioxidant properties and potential therapeutic benefits including antiinflammatory, antiproliferative, and antigenotoxic effects. The few cinnamoyl anthranilates naturally produced in plants such as oats and carnations result from the coupling of various hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs to anthranilic acid. In order to achieve the microbial production of tranilast and several of its analogs, we engineered a yeast strain to co-express a 4-coumarate/CoA ligase (4CL, EC 6.2.1.12) from Arabidopsis thaliana and a hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyl-CoA/anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase (HCBT, EC 2.3.1.144) from Dianthus caryophyllus. This modified yeast strain allowed us to produce tranilast and 26 different cinnamoyl anthranilate molecules within a few hours after exogenous supply of various combinations of cinnamic acids and anthranilate derivatives. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly producing a wide range of defined cinnamoyl anthranilates in yeast and underline a potential for the biological designed synthesis of naturally and non-naturally occurring molecules.",

Moxidectin differs by the absence of a disaccharide moiety on carbon 13, a substituted olefinic side chain at carbon 25 and a unique methoxime moiety at carbon 23. Due to these modifications, moxidectin is classified as a second generation macrocyclic lactone.

A readily available chiral starting material is manipulated through successive reactions, often using achiral reagents, to obtain the desired target molecule. This can meet the criteria for enantioselective synthesis when a new chiral species is created, such as in an SN2 reaction. Chiral pool synthesis is especially attractive for target molecules having similar chirality to a relatively inexpensive naturally occurring building-block such as a sugar or amino acid. However, the number of possible reactions the molecule can undergo is restricted and tortuous synthetic routes may be required (e.g. Oseltamivir total synthesis). This approach also requires a stoichiometric amount of the enantiopure starting material, which can be expensive if it is not naturally occurring.",

The genus Sorangium produces almost half of the secondary metabolites isolated from these microorganisms. Nevertheless, genetic systems for Sorangium strains are poorly developed, which makes the identification of the genes directing natural product biosynthesis difficult. Using biparental and triparental mating, we have developed methodologies for DNA transfer from Escherichia coli via conjugation for the genome sequencing model strain So ce56 and the secondary metabolite multiproducing strain So ce12. The conjugation protocol developed for strain So ce56 is not applicable to other Sorangium strains. Crucial points for the conjugation are the ratio of E. coli and Sorangium cellulosum cells, the choice of liquid or solid medium, the time used for the conjugation process and antibiotic selection in liquid medium prior to the plating of cells. A mariner-based transposon containing a hygromycin resistance gene was generated and used as the selectable marker for S. cellulosum. The transposon randomly integrates into the chromosome of both strains. As a proof of principle, S. cellulosum So ce12 transposon mutants were screened using an overlay assay to target the chivosazole biosynthetic gene cluster.",

The molecules that usually become allergens are intact proteins or glycoproteins. Hypoallergenic dog food diets offer a variety of protein sources that are unique by using proteins that are not recognized by the dog's antibodies as being antigens, minimizing allergic reactions. Adding novel protein sources, such as novel meats that a dog or its ancestors have never been exposed to is one method. Novel proteins can also be created by chemically modifying well known protein sources using hydrolysis techniques, rendering proteins unrecognizable by the gastrointestinal tract. Not all antigens are specific to proteins, however, and it is possible for anything that the body ingests to become an allergen. Providing diets with a limited amount of ingredients can be used for diagnostic purposes, as well as for dogs who are allergic to the common",

Site-selective reactions to access each possible constitutional isomer independently are scarce but highly desirable because cumbersome purification procedures are avoided, and other isomers are not produced as waste. Some LSF reactions provide one constitutional isomer in high selectivity based on innate substrate selectivity for a given reaction or based on catalyst control. The discovery of site-selective LSF reactions constitutes an important research objective in the field of synthetic methodology development. References Molecules Transformation (function)",

Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem-solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total synthesis.",

Lubricin's unglycosylated regions can interact with cartilage proteins. This characteristic may aid in the molecule's boundary lubricating ability.",

This principle favors isotopic labeling, since changing the isotope of one atom in a molecule is the smallest change that can be both easily enacted and traced in the reaction. If the isotope is placed in the molecule at a position directly involved in the mechanism of the reaction, a kinetic isotope effect is expected. This can be used to study aspects of the mechanism independently or alongside a crossover experiment. The kinetic isotope effect is a change in the rate of reaction based on the change in isotope, not a change in the mechanism of the reaction itself, so isotopic labeling generally satisfies the requirements for a valid crossover experiment.

FOP is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene which results in progressive heterotopic ossification, a process wherein connective tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle, ligaments, tendons) are replaced with bone. The ossification occurring as a result of FOP is insidious and cumulative, and is provoked during flare-ups or in response to injury. Treatment options for patients with FOP are extremely limited, although there has been substantial recent interest in novel treatments for this disease.  Palovarotene is a selective agonist of retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR\u03b3) belonging to a class of medications known as retinoids, similar in mechanism to drugs like [tazarotene] or [trifarotene], which are derivatives of [vitamin A]. It first garnered interest as a potential treatment for emphysema, but was eventually recognized as a potential novel therapy for patients with FOP. Agonists for retinoic acid receptors have been shown to inhibit chondrogenesis of heterotopic ossification in a transgenic mice model of FOP, with selective RAR\u03b3 agonists (e.g. palovarotene) demonstrating the greatest efficacy.  Palovarotene was approved for use in Canada in January 2022 for the management of heterotopic ossification in patients with FOP, representing the first global approval for any FOP therapy. It has been granted rare pediatric disease and breakthrough therapy designations from the US FDA, although a previously submitted NDA was withdrawn in August 2021 pending the resubmission of additional data analyses.']",

The genus Walsura (Meliaceae), comprising about 16 species, distributes in subtropical regions such as Southern China, India, and Indonesia [3]. In previous literature, kinds of natural products such as triterpenoids, phenols, and steroids have been identified in this genus. Some triterpenoids and phenols exhibited cell protection, antioxidation and antimalarial activities [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. However, the chemical constituents from Walsura robusta and their activities study are few. We reported herein the isolation, characterization as well as cytotoxic activity of these highly oxidized limonoids and a plausible biosynthesis pathway of 5 and 6.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nThe MeOH extract of Walsura yunnanensis was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a residue, which was then defatted by petroleum ether and extracted with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, ODS, HPLC, and Sephadex LH-20 to yield compounds 1-6 (detailed procedures see Extraction and Isolation part).\n\nWalsurobustone A (1) was isolated as a white amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was determined to be C 28 H 38 O 9 by the [M + Na] + ion peak at m/z 541.2418 (calcd 541.2413 for C 28 H 38 O 9 Na) in the HRESIMS, with 16 mass units less than that of the known compound yunnanol A, isolated from the congener plant Page 2 of 8 Hou et al.

The combined strain of arching and splitting distortion is thought to force the PAH molecules out of the plane and generate contortions. A switch to umbrella geometry may occur at n=12 Figure 3.",

With hydrophobic cavities that can hold smaller molecules or ions, calixarenes belong to the class of cavitands known in host\u2013guest chemistry.. Nomenclature Calixarene nomenclature is straightforward and involves counting the number of repeating units in the ring and include it in the name. A calix[4]arene has 4 units in the ring and a calix[6]arene has 6. A substituent in the meso position Rb is added to the name with a prefix C- as in C-methylcalix[6]arene The word calixarene is derived from the Greec calix or chalice because this type of molecule resembles a vase (or cup) and from the word arene that refers to the aromatic building block. Synthesis Calixarenes are generally produced by condensation of two components: an electron-rich aromatic compound, classically a 4-substituted phenol, and an aldehyde, classically formaldehyde.",

All but one of the Micromonospora strains formed a tight cluster, as had previously been demonstrated by a 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis. However, the intrageneric relationships deduced from the gyrB-based phylogeny were different from those based on their 16S rDNA sequences. To examine which phylogeny would be more relevant for classifying genus Micromonospora, DNA-DNA hybridization experiments were performed. The gyrB-based classification agrees with the results of the DNA-DNA hybridization studies, indicating that this classification method is useful for analysing the phylogenetic relationships of high G+C Gram-positive bacteria at the level of the genomic species. Genus Micromonospora was reclassified into the following 14 species: Micromonospora echinospora, Micromonospora pallida, Micromonospora nigra, Micromonospora purpureochromogenes, Micromonospora aurantiaca, Micromonospora carbonacea, Micromonospora chalcea, Micromonospora chersina, Micromonospora coerulea, Micromonospora gallica, Micromonospora halophytica, Micromonospora inositola, Micromonospora olivasterospora and Micromonospora rosaria.",

They are typically found as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as saturated or unsaturated depending on the chemical structure of the fatty acids involved. Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms double-bonded, so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Trans fats are a type of unsaturated fat with trans-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature",

These ceramides are synthesized from the acylation of sphingosine. The biosynthetic pathway for sphingosine is found below: As the image denotes, during sphingosine synthesis, palmitoyl CoA and serine undergo a condensation reaction which results in the formation of dehydrosphingosine. This product is then reduced to form dihydrospingosine, which is converted to sphingosine via the oxidation reaction by FAD. Cholesterol This lipid belongs to a class of molecules called sterols. Sterols have four fused rings and a hydroxyl group. Cholesterol is a particularly important molecule. Not only does it serve as a component of lipid membranes, it is also a precursor to several steroid hormones, including cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen. Cholesterol is synthesized from acetyl CoA. The pathway is shown below:",

The dipeptide consists of the amino acids L-proline and L-valine and is solved in acetonitrile (MeCN). While the amino terminus of valine is protected by the methoxycarbonyl group the carboxy terminus of proline reacts with the product of step one forming the esterified product of both chemicals. In this reaction triethylamine works as a basic solvent. As a final step, the present molecule reacts with ammonium acetate in water forming the imidazole heterocycles on both sides of the molecule. Another option is to esterify it with boc-protected proline first, then form the imidazole heterocycles with ammonium acetate and add valine in the end after acidic deprotection of prolines N-terminus. In both cases, the final product is the daclatasvir free base. In the drug, daclatasvir is present in the hydrochloride salt form.",

The results show that resistance to irradiation is a function of the chemical nature of the exposed molecules and the wavelengths of the UV light.

As a cyclic analogue of D-alanine, cycloserine acts against two crucial enzymes important in the cytosolic stages of peptidoglycan synthesis: alanine racemase (Alr) and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (Ddl). The first enzyme is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme which converts the L-alanine to the D-alanine form. The second enzyme is involved in joining two of these D-alanine residues together by catalyzing the formation of the ATP-dependent D-alanine-D-alanine dipeptide bond between the resulting D-alanine molecules. If both of these enzymes are inhibited, then D-alanine residues cannot form and previously formed D-alanine molecules cannot be joined together. This effectively leads to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis.",

It is highly concentrated in muscle and brain tissues. Carnosine was discovered by Russian chemist Vladimir Gulevich. Carnosine is naturally produced by the body in the liver from beta-alanine and histidine. Like carnitine, carnosine is composed of the root word carn, meaning \"flesh\", alluding to its prevalence in meat. There are no plant-based sources of carnosine, however synthetic supplements do exist. Biosynthesis Carnosine is synthesized within the body from beta-alanine and histidine. Beta-alanine is a product of pyrimidine catabolism and histidine is an essential amino acid. Since beta-alanine is the limiting substrate, supplementing just beta-alanine effectively increases the intramuscular concentration of carnosine. Physiological effects",

Alanine appears in blocks of six to fourteen units that form \u03b2-sheets. These alanine blocks can stack to create crystalline structures in the fiber, linking different protein molecules together. Glycine is present in different motifs, such as GGX and GPGXX (where X = A, L, Q, or Y), that also have specific secondary structures (3 10 helix and \u03b2-spiral, respectively). Glycine-rich regions are more amorphous and contribute to extensibility and flexibility.",

Normally in PLP reactions an acidic amino acid residue such as a carboxylic acid group, with a pKa of about 5, protonates the pyridine ring. The protonation of the pyridine nitrogen allows the nitrogen to accept additional negative charge. Therefore, due to the Arg219, the PLP-stabilized carbanion intermediate is less likely to form. Another problem identified was the need for another basic residue to return Lys39 and Tyr265 back to their protonated and unprotonated forms for L-alanine and vice versa for D-alanine. Watanabe et al. found no amino acid residues or water molecules, other than the carboxylate group of PLP-Ala, to be close enough (within 4.5A) to protonate or deprotonate Lys or Tyr.

The first methylation, that of PE to PMME, has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in conversion of PE to PC. It is suspected that the structure or specific conformation adopted by PE has a lower affinity for the PEMT active site; consequently, upon methylation, PMME would be immediately converted to PDME and PDME to PC, via a Bi-Bi or ping-pong mechanism before another PE molecule could enter the active site.

For the case of butadiene, the 20 possible Rumer structures are shown, where 1 and 2 are the covalent structures, 3-14 are the monoionic structures, and 15-20 are the diionic structures.

The simplest case is a pair of water molecules with one hydrogen bond between them, which is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice.

(2) Methods: Nano-electrospray ionization on a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer was used to analyse the brain regions of subjects aged 18-104 years. (3) Results: With age, the cerebellum showed many changes in the major phospholipids (&amp;gt;10% of the phospholipid class). In both membrane types, these included increases in PE 18:0_22:6 and PS 18:0_22:6, decreases in PE 18:0_20:4 and PS 18:0_18:1 and an increase in PC 16:0_16:0 (microsomal membrane only). In addition, twenty-one minor phospholipids also changed. In the motor cortex, only ten minor phospholipids changed with age. With age, the acyl composition of the membranes in the cerebellum increased in docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) and decreased in the arachidonic (20:4) and adrenic (22:4) acids. A comparison of phospholipid changes in the cerebellum, motor cortex and other brain areas is provided. (4) Conclusions: The cerebellum is exceptional in the large number of major phospholipids that undergo changes (with consequential changes in acyl composition) with age, whereas the motor cortex is highly resistant to change.",

This prevents the magnesium and the chloride from interacting directly; instead, the water molecules act as charge transmitters. The five chloride anions are each coordinated to two potassium cations as well as four water molecules. This means that each chloride anion receives 1/6 of a +1 charge from each of the two potassium ions. The chloride also obtains 1/6 of a +1 charge from each the four water molecules. The charges thus total six 1/6 positive charges, which balance the negative charge of the chloride. These two aspects render the rare face sharing described of the second and third of Pauling's rule acceptable in the carnallite structure.",

In both types, the binding region is typically located in a beta sheet structure, whereas the binding regions of antibodies, called complementarity-determining regions, are flexible loops. Based on gamma crystallin Historically, Affilin molecules were based on gamma crystallin, a family of proteins found in the eye lens of vertebrates, including humans. It consists of two identical domains with mainly beta sheet structure and a total molecular mass of about 20 kDa.

Since molecules may be represented by molecular graphs this is strongly related to graph mining and structured data mining. The main problem is how to represent molecules while discriminating the data instances. One way to do this is chemical similarity metrics, which has a long tradition in the field of cheminformatics. Typical approaches to calculate chemical similarities use chemical fingerprints, but this loses the underlying information about the molecule topology. Mining the molecular graphs directly avoids this problem. So does the inverse QSAR problem which is preferable for vectorial mappings. Coding(Moleculei,Moleculeji)",

This acts as an indicator of genetic fitness to potential mates, as a bright male is using his diet-based coloration to show off his ability to survive and catch food.

Deprotonation at the nitrogen atom generates a Schiff base, which tautomerizes to form an enamine that gets protonated via the acid catalyst, which is commonly concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The second major step, which is also the rate-determining step, is the annulation of the molecule. Immediately following the annulation, there is a proton transfer, which eliminates the positive formal charge on the nitrogen atom. The alcohol is then protonated, followed by the dehydration of the molecule, resulting in the end product of a substituted quinoline. Regioselectivity",

Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2). It must be noted that answering this query in a typical SPARQL engine involves the exhaustive examination of all the candidate molecules that may potentially contain a collection of atoms that satisfy the laid out bonding criteria. Unfortunately, since the SPARQL query engines currently available have not been explicitly optimized chemical searching needs, they often lack many of the mechanisms developed over the past decades to accelerate the solution of this problem, and resemble the brute force approach to graph matching more closely.\n\nAppendix 2. An automatically generated (based on graphical user input) SPARQL query to identify all molecules containing an ethyl subgraph, altered for improved readability. Note the use of 'has single bond with' direct atom relationship to improve query performance.\n\nprefix Description logic-safe rules may be used to reason about instances of an OWL-DL ontology where the description follows a graph-like pattern instead of the general 'tree-like' expression. In this way, one can combine classical DL-reasoning with graph-like descriptions to classify molecules as more specific kinds of compounds, provided that they satisfy certain sub-graph conditions. For instance, an ethyl compound would be a kind of a molecule that contains an ethyl group with two carbon atoms linked together by a single bond.",

In the last estimates of the World Health Organization, 235 million people had asthma, 64 million suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a few other million had allergic rhinitis or other often underdiagnosed respiratory diseases [2].\n\nTraditionally, the treatment of these diseases consists of treatment with inhalation drugs (such as corticosteroids and \u03b2-adrenergic agonists) formulated to be used as a nasal spray, dry powder inhaler, metered-dose inhaler, or as a nebulizer [1]. Even though some commercial formulations of inhaled microparticles can only deliver a low percentage (10-20%) of their labelled dose in the interest area of the lungs [3], these devices and their formulations are still effective, non-invasive, and convenient ways to provide a pulmonary administration of small molecule drugs and biopharmaceuticals [4].\n\nLung delivery systems are advantageous and an alternative to systemic drug delivery because they allow the topical action of drugs [5], by providing a targeted therapy on the affected airway's area with a higher drug concentration, but at the same time with reduced systemic side effects derived from the lower systemic exposure to the drugs [4].\n\nOne of the drug classes used in lung therapy is corticosteroids, very important in the regulation of the inflammatory process and response. Fluticasone propionate (FP), a second-generation trifluorinated glucocorticosteroid based on the androstane nucleus, is a highly potent drug and one of the most used corticosteroids to treat asthma (inhalation) and allergic rhinitis (intranasally) [1]. FP ( Figure 1) is a very effective drug in the treatment of these diseases, but has a limitation due to its water insolubility that may lead to a reduction in the local absorption of the drug [6]. In order to be pharmacologically active, drugs should be lipophilic to permeate the biological membrane (through passive diffusion) and at the same time must have some aqueous solubility [7].",

Mometasone furoate, a closely related corticosteroid currently available in an intranasal formulation, is being investigated in an oral inhalation formulation for the treatment of asthma. This article reviews available data on the comparative structure-activity relationships, chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate to assess whether claims of differences in the absolute systemic bioavailability of the 2 compounds are supported by the published literature. Information for this review was identified through a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1966 to the present that contained the term mometasone or fluticasone. The resulting list was narrowed by excluding articles dealing with dermatologic applications. A systematic review was conducted of the identified literature pertaining to the molecular structure, topical potency, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of the 2 agents. Additionally, the pharmacology of the 2 moieties was assessed by a review of the available literature on receptor binding affinity, transactivation and transrepression potency, and inhibition of inflammatory-cell cytokine expression. Based on the available data, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate have similar physicochemical properties and structure-activity relationships. When administered intranasally, mometasone furoate is reported to have comparable relative systemic bioavailability to that of fluticasone propionate (mean plasma area under the curve, 123 pmol x h/L vs 112 pmol x h/L, respectively). When administered as a single dose by dry powder inhaler, orally inhaled fluticasone propionate is reported to have a total systemic bioavailability of approximately 17%, whereas that of mometasone furoate is reported to be &lt; 1%. However, the mometasone furoate bioavailability study that reported the latter value used lower drug doses and a less sensitive assay than the fluticasone propionate bioavailability study. When multiple-dose data were used, mometasone furoate had an estimated 11% systemic bioavailability, similar to that of fluticasone propionate. Inhaled fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate appear to have comparable potential systemic absorption and, based on the total systemic bioavailabilities of the parent compounds, have a low potential for systemic side effects at the recommended clinical doses. However, in the case of mometasone furoate, the contribution of the active metabolites to systemic effects has not been adequately assessed.",

They are the most common treatment for patients with nasal polyposis and have been designated as the treatment of choice for allergic rhinitis (Derendorf & Meltzer, 2008;Zele et al., 2010). The systemic GCs are effective in treating allergic rhinitis, but the high risk of serious toxicity with long-term administration has hindered their usefulness. The first successful use of GC as a pressurized aerosol with no apparent evidence of systemic toxicity was the beclomethasone in 1972. In the following years, corticosteroid molecules have been refined to create more potent agents with lower bioavailability and enhanced safety profiles. Nowadays, various compounds are approved for the management of allergic rhinitis in the United States: triamcinolone acetonide, flunisolide, budesonide, beclomethasone dipropionate, ciclesonide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, fluticasone furoate (Derendorf & Meltzer, 2008;Zele et al., 2010).

Data from abstracts presented at respiratory society meetings, and relevant background information, are also reviewed. In clinical studies, MF, administered by dry powder inhaler (MF-DPI), was effective in treating all severities of persistent asthma, improving pulmonary function, reducing asthma symptoms, and reducing or eliminating the need for oral corticosteroids. Once-daily dosing of MF-DPI was effective in patients with mild or moderate persistent asthma previously taking twice-daily regimens of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and in patients taking only inhaled beta2-agonists for symptom relief. Once-daily dosing in the evening with MF-DPI 200 microg conferred a greater benefit than morning dosing with MF-DPI 200 microg. Patients with severe asthma who were dependent on oral corticosteroids (OCSs) and high doses of ICSs were able to achieve greater asthma control and reduce or even eliminate OCSs when switched to MF-DPI. In trials of up to 1 year in duration, MF-DPI was well tolerated, with the majority of adverse events considered mild or moderate in intensity. MF had low systemic bioavailability and no clinically significant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis suppression at therapeutic doses. The DPI device is a multiple-dose inhaler with a counter containing agglomerates of MF and lactose. Patients of all severities of persistent asthma were able to generate and maintain airflow profiles necessary to provide a uniform and accurate dose. Only one study evaluated both morning and evening administration of once-daily doses, and one of the comparative clinical trials was an open-label study. Once-daily administration of MF-DPI 200-400 microg in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma effectively improved lung function and asthma control. In patients with severe persistent asthma dependent on oral corticosteroids, treatment with MF-DPI 400 microg BID permitted substantial reduction of oral corticosteroid use.

Ciclesonide is administered via a metered-dose inhaler using hydrofl uoroalkane (HFA) as the propellant or in a hypotonic formulation as nasal spray. In contrast to other CS that bind directly to the corticosteroid receptor, eg, budesonide, ciclesonide is a prodrug with almost no receptor binding affi nity. Intracellular airway esterases convert ciclesonide to its pharmacologically active metabolite desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC), which has a 100-fold higher binding affi nity for the corticosteroid receptor than the prodrug (Dietzel et al 2001;Dent 2002).\n\nAnother feature that is associated with an improved effi cacy of CS is the ability to form highly lipophilic fatty acid esters. The conjugation of a corticosteroid with fatty acids in the pulmonary tissue provides a mechanism by which the drug can be retained in the lung for a prolonged period of time (Edsb\u00e4cker and Brattsand 2002). A hydroxyl group at position C-21 is required for the formation of the ester bond between the corticosteroid and the fatty acid (Tunek et al 1997). Budesonide and des-CIC have a hydroxyl group at the C-21 position and conjugates with oleic and palmitic acid have been found in vitro in rat trachea and lung tissues (Nave et al 2004;Lexm\u00fcller et al 2007). Uptake and metabolism of ciclesonide are illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nThe aim is to review the metabolism data supporting the activation of ciclesonide and esterifi cation of des-CIC and to discuss the clinical implications this may have on asthma and allergic rhinitis treatment.\n\n\nMethods\n\nAll methods described in this section are briefl y summarized as they are previously published.",

Topically acting drugs offer advantages in these indications since they have a rapid onset. Further, antihistamines and corticosteroids have as topically acting drugs a low systemic bioavailability and hence lead to less adverse side effects and no CNS effects. Compared with oral application, the IN administration of these drugs requires lower doses [113,114]. The role of histamines as mediators for allergic rhinitis has been known since the early twentieth century. Levocabastine is an H1-receptor-selective drug with high potency. It belongs to the second generation of histamine H1-receptor antagonists. Those second-generation drugs show an improved benefit/risk profile without CNS sedative effect when administered locally instead of orally [115,116]. Another group of topically administered drugs for the treatment of seasonal rhinitis is the steroidal antiinflammatory agents, namely corticosteroids. Corticosteroids bind to a single glucocorticoid receptor, localised in the target cell. Through transactivation or transrepression, antiinflammatory effects are generated. Those effects include influencing the release of cytokines and mediators as well as a reduced inflammatory cell recruitment within the nose [117]. Many approved corticosteroids are on the market, such as budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone, mometasone and triamcinolone. Even though corticosteroids are regarded to be more potent and efficient than antihistamines, no significant differences have been found for these two groups regarding the benefit/risk profile [113].\n\n\nIntranasal application used for systemic delivery",

Recent randomised, double-blind, multicentre trials have assessed the efficacy of mometasone furoate delivered by dry powder inhaler over 12 weeks in adults and adolescents with mild to severe persistent asthma. Mometasone furoate 200 microg twice daily or 400 microg once daily in the morning or 200 microg once daily in the evening improved lung function, asthma symptom scores and use of rescue medication to a significantly greater extent than placebo in patients who had previously received only short-acting inhaled beta2-adrenoceptor agonists alone as treatment in 3 trials (n = 195 to 306). In studies in 227 to 733 patients with mild to moderate asthma who were receiving ongoing treatment with inhaled corticosteroids prior to enrolment, mometasone furoate 100 to 400 microg twice daily was consistently better at improving the above indicators of asthma than placebo. Mometasone furoate 100 to 200 microg twice daily was as effective as beclomethasone dipropionate 200 microg twice daily or budesonide 400 microg twice daily and mometasone furoate 200 microg twice daily was as effective as fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice daily. Mometasone furoate 400 or 800 microg twice daily was also consistently more effective than placebo in reducing oral corticosteroid dosages and improving lung function and asthma symptoms in 132 patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Once daily administration of mometasone furoate 400 microg appears to be as effective at improving indicators of asthma as twice daily administration of 200 microg. Patients receiving mometasone furoate &lt; or =800 microg/day and recipients of placebo experienced a similar overall incidence of adverse events considered to be related to treatment. The most common of these events were oral candidiasis, headache, pharyngitis and dysphonia. Mometasone furoate 100 to 400 microg twice daily, beclomethasone dipropionate 200 microg twice daily, budesonide 400 microg twice daily or fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice daily were similarly tolerated. Inhaled mometasone furoate is well tolerated, with minimal systemic activity and is equally effective when administered as a divided dose or as a single daily dose. Use of the drug can result in a decrease in requirements for oral corticosteroids in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma and is as effective as other inhaled corticosteroids currently used in the treatment of mild to moderate persistent asthma. Thus mometasone furoate is suitable for the control of mild to severe persistent asthma in adults or adolescents.",

It is commonly treated with intranasal corticosteroids which may increase the potential inception of side effects of the same type of drugs used for the treatment of other allergic diseases. A method to assess the systemic effect of corticosteroids is the evaluation of their effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, it is not clear which test is best for detection of clinically relevant HPA axis suppression in children Morning plasma cortisol levels are twice that of late afternoon and evening values and a delay in the time of onset in peak cortisol levels has been observed in children treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Single morning cortisol level has a low sensitivity for detecting adrenal insufficiency in children. 24-Hour plasma cortisol is a good test because it is a non-invasive measure of the biologically active free cortisol levels for the entire day. For research purposes, the 24-hour integrated concentration plasma cortisol test is preferred. Studies that have looked at HPA axis suppression with intranasal corticosteroids indicate that overall, intranasal corticosteroids have a minimal effect on the HPA axis. A review of the literature reveals one study in which there was a decreased output of urinary cortisol during treatment with either budesonide or fluticasone propionate in adults. Other studies with fluticasone propionate or budesonide have shown no effect on the HPA axis in children. Beclomethasone dipropionate was shown to affect urinary cortisol output in one study on healthy volunteers. However, in a long-term study in children, no effect on the HPA axis was found. Mometasone furoate has been extensively studied in more than 20 trials of adults and children. No effects on the HPA axis were detected in either children or adults. Fluticasone furoate nasal spray was not associated with HPA axis suppression. It is unlikely that children are more sensitive to corticosteroids than adults. There is no reason to perform routine monitoring of adrenal function in children who are treated with intranasal corticosteroid unless those drugs are used concomitantly with inhaled corticosteroids and/or steroid ointments for the possible concomitant presence of asthma and/or atopic dermatitis.",

In vitro studies examining the respiratory tissue-binding properties of corticosteroids showed FF to have the largest cellular accumulation and slowest rate of efflux compared with other clinically used inhaled corticosteroids, consistent with greater tissue retention. The enhanced affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor binding of FF, coupled with its extended tissue association, may be expected to lead to greater and more prolonged anti-inflammatory effects and should provide relevant once-daily efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the rate and extent of systemic absorption of FF from the lung following inhaled administration of FF from three exploratory dry powder formulations (via DISKHALER(\u00ae)) compared with inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP) [via DISKHALER(\u00ae)] using deconvolution analysis. This open-label, part-randomized, six-way crossover study evaluated three early development dry powder inhaled formulations of FF administered as single doses via DISKHALER(\u00ae). Healthy male subjects (n = 24) each received FF (2,000 \u03bcg; three formulations), inhaled FP (1,000 \u03bcg; via DISKHALER(\u00ae)) and 250 \u03bcg of each molecule by intravenous infusion. The bioavailability of both inhaled FF and FP represents absorption from the lung as the oral bioavailability from the swallowed portion of the inhaled dose is negligible (&lt;1.5 %). To investigate the absorption kinetics from the lung, the inhaled concentration-time data were subjected to deconvolution analysis using derived pharmacokinetic parameters from fitting of the intravenous concentration-time data. The terminal elimination half-life (t(\u00bd\u03b2)) for inhaled FF was considerably longer (range 17-24 h) than the t(\u00bd\u03b2) estimated for intravenous FF (14 h), whereas t(\u00bd\u03b2) for FP was similar whether inhaled or given intravenously (11 and 14 h, respectively). This would suggest that FF is exhibiting absorption rate-limited pharmacokinetics following inhaled FF dosing and that the apparent t(\u00bd\u03b2) is an estimate of absorption rate. The lung mean absorption time for FF was approximately 7 h irrespective of formulation, which was considerably longer than FP (2.1 h). The time for 90 % absorption from the lung was significantly longer for FF (20-30 h) than for FP (8 h), indicating a significantly longer lung retention time for FF. In comparison with inhaled FP, inhaled FF (independent of formulation) demonstrated prolonged absorption from the lung into the systemic circulation, indicating a longer lung retention time and suggesting the potential for maintained efficacy with once-daily administration.",

Systemic oral corticosteroids are also known to be effective for treatment of allergic rhinitis. These topical and systemic corticosteroids are both effective formulations for allergic rhinitis, and both drugs have some side effects. When treatment formulations for allergic rhinitis are selected based on side effects, topical corticosteroids are more commonly selected than systemic steroids. Systemic corticosteroids, on the other hand, have traditionally been believed to have higher and more instantaneous therapeutic effects than those of topical corticosteroids. However, there have been few reports of direct comparisons between topical corticosteroid and systemic corticosteroid efficacy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the subjective outcomes of nasal symptom management using topical intranasal corticosteroid therapy or systemic oral corticosteroid therapy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. We compared the efficacy of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) to betamethasone oral tablets (BOT) for the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. In an open label study, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis who had intermediate-to-severe symptoms and who visited the hospital without prior treatment were allocated to 1 of 3 treatment groups (noncorticosteroid group, topical corticosteroid group, and oral corticosteroid group). Evaluation was conducted using allergy diaries that consisted of patient questionnaires. The Japanese Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JRQLQ) was used in this study. Compared to only loratazine nonsteroid therapy, both MFNS 200\u03bcg once daily and BOT 0.25mg twice daily significantly reduced the total and individual symptom scores for sneezing, nasal obstruction, watery nasal discharge, and nasal itching (P&lt;0.05). Scores for itching of the eyes were reduced slightly more in the MFNS group than in the noncorticosteriod treatment group, but the difference was not significant. MFNS and BOT have virtually equivalent effects on nasal symptoms in patients with seasonal allergies. Our study was the first direct comparison between an intranasal corticosteroid spray and a systemic oral corticosteroid for seasonal allergic rhinitis. No significant differences were found in the therapeutic effects of the topical and systemic corticosteroids tested, suggesting that topical corticosteroids are expected to sufficiently improve nasal symptoms without administration of oral corticosteroids. Treatment with intranasal corticosteroid spray is more strongly recommended than treatment with systemic corticoid steroids, due to the side effects associated with each treatment.",

Bud, which is a continuously inhaled corticosteroid, is commonly administered for the treatment of human asthma. 4,5 Compared with other glucocorticoids in this class, Bud has stronger local anti-inflammatory and pharmaceutical effects, a longer action time, and a less systemic action; therefore, it could significantly reduce the adverse reactions when used in local treatment. 6,7 However, the poor water solubility of Bud affects its dissolution and release behavior, thus influencing the drug concentration at the inflammatory site and its local bioavailability. 8,9 In order to discover new compounds with a higher activity and explore the relationship between the structure and activity of glucocorticoid receptor modulators, a recent study selected 77 prednisolone C-21 heteroaryl thioethers as target molecules [10][11][12] and investigated the effect of molecular force field on their drug activity by means of molecular docking and establishing their three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models. The result indicated that the introduction of hydrophilic groups into the C 21 substituent position of glucocorticoid could enhance the drug activity. 13 Therefore, we hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory activity of Bud would be increased by conjugating small hydrophilic groups to its 21-hydroxy group with an increase in water solubility.",

In recent years, increased understanding of corticosteroid and glucocorticoid receptor pharmacology has enabled the development of molecules designed specifically to achieve potent, localized activity with minimal risk of systemic exposure. Pharmacologic potency studies using affinity and other assessments have produced similar rank orders of potency, with the most potent being mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and its modification, fluticasone furoate. The furoate and propionate ester side chains render these agents highly lipophilic, which may facilitate their absorption through nasal mucosa and uptake across phospholipid cell membranes. These compounds demonstrate negligible systemic absorption. Systemic absorption rates are higher among the older corticosteroids (flunisolide, beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone acetonide, and budesonide), which have bioavailabilities in the range of 34-49%. Studies, including 1-year studies with mometasone furoate, fluticasone propionate, and budesonide that evaluated potential systemic effects of INSs in children have generally found no adverse effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function or growth. Clinical data suggest no significant differences in efficacy between the INSs. Theoretically, newer agents with lower systemic availability may be preferable, and may come closer to the pharmacokinetic/pharmacologic criteria for the ideal therapeutic choice.",

Integrated care pathways (ICP), developed taking into account the data obtained about patients using a mobile application, suggest the use of intranasal corticosteroids as the first line of therapy, including in patients with intermittent rhinitis who have not previously received treatment when assessing the condition according to the VAS for more than 5 points, in patients who received earlier treatment when assessing the condition according to the VAS less than 5 points. According to the data in the medical decision support system and continuing medical education UpToDate, inhaled corticosteroids are considered as the first-line drugs for the pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis. In terms of pharmacodynamic efficacy, intranasal corticosteroids are comparable to each other. The selection criteria can be considered: the value of systemic absorption; lipophilicity; the start time of the action; frequency of introduction, organoleptic properties; the possibility of influencing non-nasal symptoms.

However, given the high potency of these drugs and their widespread use in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, it is important to ensure that intranasal corticosteroids have a favourable benefit-risk ratio. One agent that typifies the systemic safety found in the majority of intranasal corticosteroids is mometasone furoate nasal spray, a potent and effective treatment for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and nasal polyposis. Mometasone furoate does not reach high systemic concentrations or cause clinically significant adverse effects. Results from pharmacokinetic studies in adults and children suggest that systemic exposure to mometasone furoate after intranasal administration is negligible. This is probably because of the inherently low aqueous solubility of mometasone furoate, which allows only a small fraction of the drug to cross the nasal mucosa and enter the bloodstream, and because a large amount of the administered drug is swallowed and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. There is no clinical evidence that mometasone furoate nasal spray suppresses the function of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis when the drug is administered at clinically relevant doses (100-200 microg/day); consequently, mometasone furoate nasal spray has not been associated with growth inhibition in children. The safety and tolerability of mometasone furoate nasal spray have been rigorously assessed in clinical trials involving approximately 4,500 patients, with epistaxis, headache and pharyngitis being the most common adverse effects associated with treatment in adolescents and adults. The clinical effectiveness of mometasone furoate nasal spray, coupled with its agreeable safety and tolerability profile, confirms its favourable benefit-risk ratio.",

The climate is cool and arid in winter, but warm and rainy in summer. This paper studied the species diversity and community structure of forest communities there, based on field investigation data and by using diversity, richness and evenness indices. The results showed that the species diversity and evenness of the communities were in the order of Acer davidii + Acer mono &gt; Acer davidii + Carpinus turczaninouii &gt; Quercus liaolugensis &gt; Quercus varibilis &gt; Pinus armandii + Betula albo-sinensis &gt; Pinus tabulaeformis + Quercus glandulifera &gt; Betula platyphylla &gt; Platycladus orientalis + Quercus variabilis &gt; Betula albo-sinensis &gt; Pinus armandii &gt; Platycladus orientalis &gt; Pinus tabulaeformis &gt; Populus davidiana + Betula albo-sinensis. The diversity and richness of shrub layer were higher than those of herb layer and arbor layer, but the evenness of arbor, shrub and herb layers had no significant difference. There were positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) between Shannon-Wiener index, Hill index, and species richness from 1 000 m to 1 920 m above sea level, but negative correlations (P &lt; 0.05) from 1920 m to the top of the Mountain. The species diversity showed a \"mid-altitude bulge\" pattern with the change of altitude, and the reason was that the combination of temperature and moisture conditions from 1000 m to 1920 m above sea level was improved, and human disturbance was decreased gradually.",

Alkaline conditions favor the elimination, or directly the decomposition, of oleuropein from the tissues of fresh green olives immersed in a lye solution. Two mechanisms occur simultaneously: first, at high pH (~ 13.9) in a 3 wt. % NaOH solution, most of the phenolic groups (pKa \u2248 10) present in the oleuropein molecule are deprotonated and present in a dissociated state. The ionized phenolate groups significantly increase the solubility of the molecule in the tissue of the olives. The oleuropein can then more easily diffuse out of the fruits and is released into the lye solution.",

The structures of the decomposition products are shown in figure 1, depicted on the left. Citrinin H1 is produced out of two citrinin molecules and its toxicity is increased compared to the original toxicity of citrinin. Citrinin H2, a formylated derivative of phenol A, is less toxic than citrinin. Phenol A seems to be produced mainly under acidic conditions. Dicitrinin A is a dimer of citrinin molecules which is mainly formed during decomposition in a neutral environment, when a high concentration of citrinin is present.

The consequences of diffusion in non-partitioned life forms might be viewed as \"parasitism by default.\" Therefore, the selection pressure on replicator molecules will be lower, as the 'lucky' molecule that produces the better enzyme has no definitive advantage over its close neighbors.

The Latin specific epithet persica means \u201cPersian\u201d, referring to the modern country of Iran. Fritillaria persica is a robust bulbous perennial growing tall. Each plant may bear up to 30, conical, narrow, bell-shaped flowers, up to long, ranging in colour from deep purple to greenish brown. A plant commonly found in cultivation outside its range is the cultivar 'Adiyaman', which is taller and more free-flowering than populations of the species inside its native range.

PS was studied by methylation analysis and (1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy, using two-dimensional (1)H,(1)H COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, and H-detected (1)H,(13)C heteronuclear correlation experiments. It was found that PS includes two structurally different polysaccharides: an alpha1--&gt;2-linked homopolymer of N-acetyl-d-perosamine [--&gt;2)-alpha-d-Rhap4NAc-(1--&gt;, PS2] and a polysaccharide composed of tetrasaccharide repeating units (PS1) with the following structure: --&gt;3)-alpha-d-Rhap4NAc-(1--&gt;2)-alpha-d-Rhap4NAc-(1--&gt;2)-alpha-d-Rhap4NAc-(1--&gt;3)-alpha-d-Rhap4 N Ac2Ac-(1--&gt; where the degree of O-acetylation of a 3-substituted Rha4NAc residue at position 2 is approximately 70%.

The divergent amino acid sequence of this atypical peroxiredoxin is reflected in its unique crystal structure. The typical peroxiredoxin is composed of a thioredoxin domain and a C-terminal, whereas PRDX5 has an N-terminal domain and a unique alpha helix replaces a loop structure in the typical thioredoxin domain. In addition, typical 2-Cys or 1-Cys peroxiredoxins are associated as anti-parallel dimers via linkage of two beta-7-strands, whereas a PRDX5 dimer is formed by close contact between an alpha-3-helix of one molecule and an alpha-5-helix from the other molecule.",

These intact as well as chemically modified LPS contained, in their O polysaccharide chain, alpha(1--&gt;2)-linked linear perosamine (4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-manno-pyranose) homopolymers with different N-acyl groups: their acyl groups comprise 3-deoxy-L-glycero-tetronyl (Inaba LPS), formyl (O9 LPS), 3-hydroxypropionyl (1875 Variant LPS), acetyl (Hakata LPS and artificially introduced into Inaba and O9 LPS), propionyl and butyryl (both artificially introduced into Inaba and O9 LPS) groups. N-Deacylation of the alpha(1--&gt;2)-linked N-(3-deoxy-L-glycero-tetronyl)perosamine homopolymer of Inaba and the N-formyl one of O9 LPS resulted in virtual elimination of their serological reactivity with both homologous and heterologous antisera. Furthermore, when the resultant NH2 groups of the N-deacylated perosamine homopolymers of both LPS were N-acylated with acetyl, propionyl or butyryl groups, they markedly recovered both of their serological reactivities. These results are compatible with the interpretation that the Inaba antigen factor C possessed by the four bacteria is substantially related to the common presence of N-acyl groups, regardless of their identity, residing in the perosamine residues constituting the O polysaccharide chain of their LPS. It was also indicated that the group antigen factor A of O1 V. cholerae is substantially related to the 3-deoxy-L-glycero-tetronyl groups residing in the perosamine homopolymer of Inaba LPS.",

Halcurin is structurally homologous with type 2 toxins, but also has sequence homology to type 1 toxins. Type 1 and 2 toxins are composed of 46 to 49 amino acid residues, and cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. Ten residues including six Cysteine (Cys) residues are completely conserved between type 1 and 2 toxins.

The LPS of O76 contained D-glucose, D-galactose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, D-fructose, D-glucosamine, D-quinovosamine (2-amino-2,6-dideoxy-D-glucose) and L-perosamine (4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-L-mannopyranose). The sugar composition of the LPS from O76 was quite similar to that of LPS from V. cholerae O1 with the exception of the presence of a small amount of D-galactose in the LPS of O76. However, perosamine, a major sugar component of the LPS from O76, was in the L configuration in contrast to the D configuration of the perosamine in the LPS of V. cholerae O1. The L-perosamine was N-acylated with an (S)-(+)-2-hydroxypropionyl group in the LPS from O76. Structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy, as well as GC/MS, revealed that the O polysaccharide chain of the LPS from O76 was an alpha(1--&gt;2)-linked homopolymer of N-[(S)-(+)-2-hydroxypropionyl]-L-perosamine. The serological cross-reactivity between the LPS of O76 and the LPS from other strains, such as V. cholerae O1 (Ogawa and Inaba O forms), Vibrio bio-serogroup 1875 (Original and Variant strains), V. cholerae O140 (Hakata) and Yersinia enterocolitica O9, was examined in passive haemolysis tests with sheep red blood cells that had been sensitized with LPS and antisera raised against whole cells of these bacteria. The latter six strains have in common the O antigen that includes Inaba antigen factor C, in addition to their own O-antigenic factors. Thus, they crossreact serologically. The O polysaccharide chains of the LPS of these six trains are known to consist exclusively of alpha(1--&gt;2)-linked D-perosamine homopolymers and differences are found only among the N-acyl substituents. In passive haemolysis tests, the LPS of O76 did not cross-react serologically with any of the other LPS examined. Thus, the results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that Inaba antigen factor C, associated with the O antigens of these six strains, which include V. cholerae O1, is related substantially and exclusively to their alpha(1--&gt;2)-linked homopolymers of N-acylated D-perosamine, and not to such homopolymers of N-acylated L-perosamine.",

It is generated from alpha-1-antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor that belongs to the serine family, by matrix metalloproteinases. It was shown that it could interact with the HIV-1 and stop the virus multiplication. In spite of interacting in a highly intensity with gp-41, the VIRIP did not prevent the multiplication of the virus. So, it was decided to increase the efficacy of this molecule creating other ones that could be more powerful. Among these 600 created molecules, there was the VIR-576 which was synthesized using the solid-phase peptide synthesis method. Moreover, another molecule was used to protect the amino groups, the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride. The next step was the purification before lyophilizing it with mannitol. Other peptides were made such as the VIR-353 or the VIR-449. Structure",

These models are associated with electrophysiological measurements and investigations that have the ability to mimic model membranes such as monolayer at the air-water interface.

Some of these are small molecules which are intrinsically fluorescent and bind a biological molecule of interest. Major examples of these are nucleic acid stains such as DAPI and Hoechst (excited by UV wavelength light) and DRAQ5 and DRAQ7 (optimally excited by red light) which all bind the minor groove of DNA, thus labeling the nuclei of cells. Others are drugs, toxins, or peptides which bind specific cellular structures and have been derivatised with a fluorescent reporter. A major example of this class of fluorescent stain is phalloidin, which is used to stain actin fibers in mammalian cells. A new peptide, known as the Collagen Hybridizing Peptide, can also be conjugated with fluorophores and used to stain denatured collagen fibers. Staining of the plant cell walls is performed using stains or dyes that bind cellulose or pectin. The quest for fluorescent probes with a high specificity that also allow",

Professional APCs Professional APCs specialize in presenting antigens to T cells. They are very efficient at internalizing antigens, either by phagocytosis (e.g. macrophages), or by receptor-mediated endocytosis (B cells), processing the antigen into peptide fragments and then displaying those peptides (bound to a class II MHC molecule) on their membrane. The T cell recognizes and interacts with the antigen-class II MHC molecule complex on the membrane of the antigen-presenting cell. An additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the antigen-presenting cell, leading to activation of the T cell. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II are defining features of professional APCs. All professional APCs also express MHC class I molecules as well.",

The binding may be mostly through non-covalent interactions while covalently linked binding can also be studied. Molecular docking aims to predict possible poses (binding modes) of the ligand when it interacts with specific regions on the receptor. Docking tools use force fields to estimate a score for ranking best poses that favored better interactions between the two molecules. In general, docking protocols are used to predict the interactions between small molecules and proteins. However, docking also can be used to detect associations and binding modes among proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA molecules, carbohydrates, and other macromolecules.",

In this study, we examined the genetic diversity of 11 Bupleurum strains, originating from 7 provinces in China, using amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. A total of 274 polymorphic bands were obtained using 6 primer combinations, indicating a high level of polymorphism across all strains. An estimation of the relative relationships among strains revealed genetic distances ranging from 0.2183 to 0.7372, with an average of 0.4161. The 2 most closely related varieties were Bupleurum chinense DC. strains collected from Lushi, Henan, and Zhangjiakou, Hebei, with a genetic nearness of 0.2183. Hierarchical clustering divided the strains into 3 main groups, with B. falcatum L. from Hebei and Liaoning Provinces forming a cluster that diverged from that of B. smithii Wolff. and B. chinense DC. B. falcatum L. (Sandao chaihu), collected from Heze, Shandong, clustered independently of the other strains, suggesting that this strain may have been introduced from a different location or that it arose as a result of intraspecific variation.

However, this assay is not applicable to the lectin pathway, thus impeding the understanding of complement inhibitors against the overall function of the complement system. The main objective of our study was to develop a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as an alternative method to assess the anti-complement activity, particularly against the lectin pathway. By using respective coating substrates against different activation pathways, followed by capturing the stable C3c fragments, our ELISA method can be used to screen complement inhibitors against the classical pathway and the lectin pathway. The inhibitory effect of suramin on the classical pathway, as measured by our hemolytic assay is consistent with previous reports. Further assessment of suramin and Bupleurum polysaccharides against the lectin pathway showed a good reproducibility of the method. Comparison of the lectin pathway IC50 between Bupleurum smithii var. parvifolium polysaccharides (1.055\u00a0mg/mL) and Bupleurum chinense polysaccharides (0.98\u00a0mg/mL) showed that, similar to the classical and alterative pathway, these two Bupleurum polysaccharides had comparable anti-complementary properties against the lectin pathway. The results demonstrate that the described ELISA assay can compensate for the shortcomings of the hemolytic assay in lectin pathway. ",

Saikosaponins are the major bioactive constituents of B. chinense, but relatively little is known about saikosaponin biosynthesis. The 454 pyrosequencing technology provides a promising opportunity for finding novel genes that participate in plant metabolism. Consequently, this technology may help to identify the candidate genes involved in the saikosaponin biosynthetic pathway. One-quarter of the 454 pyrosequencing runs produced a total of 195, 088 high-quality reads, with an average read length of 356 bases (NCBI SRA accession SRA039388). A de novo assembly generated 24, 037 unique sequences (22, 748 contigs and 1, 289 singletons), 12, 649 (52.6%) of which were annotated against three public protein databases using a basic local alignment search tool (E-value \u22641e-10). All unique sequences were compared with NCBI expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (237) and encoding sequences (44) from the Bupleurum genus, and with a Sanger-sequenced EST dataset (3, 111). The 23, 173 (96.4%) unique sequences obtained in the present study represent novel Bupleurum genes. The ESTs of genes related to saikosaponin biosynthesis were found to encode known enzymes that catalyze the formation of the saikosaponin backbone; 246 cytochrome P450 (P450s) and 102 glycosyltransferases (GTs) unique sequences were also found in the 454 dataset. Full length cDNAs of 7 P450s and 7 uridine diphosphate GTs (UGTs) were verified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or by cloning using 5' and/or 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Two P450s and three UGTs were identified as the most likely candidates involved in saikosaponin biosynthesis. This finding was based on the coordinate up-regulation of their expression with \u03b2-AS in methyl jasmonate-treated adventitious roots and on their similar expression patterns with \u03b2-AS in various B. chinense tissues. A collection of high-quality ESTs for B. chinense obtained by 454 pyrosequencing is provided here for the first time. These data should aid further research on the functional genomics of B. chinense and other Bupleurum species. The candidate genes for enzymes involved in saikosaponin biosynthesis, especially the P450s and UGTs, that were revealed provide a substantial foundation for follow-up research on the metabolism and regulation of the saikosaponins.",

In the cytosol there are fumarate molecules. Fumarate can be transformed into malate by the actions of the enzyme fumarase. Malate is acted on by malate dehydrogenase to become oxaloacetate, producing a molecule of NADH.

The structure of a urea transport family protein from Desulfovibrio vulgaris was determined by x-ray crystallography. The structure has a pathway through the membrane that is similar to that of ion channel proteins, accounting for the ability of urea transport proteins to move up to one million urea molecules per second across the membrane. Urea transporters can be inhibited by the action of urea analogues like thiourea and glycosides like phloretin. Their inhibition results in increased diuresis due to urea induced osmosis in the collecting ducts of the kidney. Types",

Yamada by DEAE Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography, and chemical characterization was performed by HPGPC, GC-MS, FT-IR and SEM. In addition, anticoagulant activities were determined by activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT) and prothrombin time (PT) using normal human plasma in vitro. The antioxidant activities against DPPH and ABTS<sup+</sup radicals were evaluated and compared. The molecular weights of GLP-1, GLP-2 and GLP-3 were 39.5, 60.4 and 3.36kDa, respectively. Monosaccharide analysis revealed that three polysaccharide fractions were homopolysaccharides and comprised of galactose only. Anticoagulant assays indicated that crude GLP, and purified GLP-1 and GLP-2 effectively prolonged APTT and TT, but not PT. All polysaccharide fractions exhibited significant in vitro antioxidant activities in a dose-dependent manner. GLP-2 showed consistently better anticoagulant and antioxidant activities compared with GLP, GLP-1 and GLP-3. These results demonstrate that sulfated polysaccharides isolated from Grateloupia livida can serve as readily available alternative natural sources of anticoagulant and antioxidant agents.",

Yamada and Grateloupia turuturu [2]. In recent years, most research has involved the Grateloupia family, finding that extracts from the Grateloupia family have wide biological effects such as antiangiogenic [3], antioxidant [4], antiviral [5], anti-allergic [6], and anticancer activities [7].G. livida (Harv.) Yamada (GL), a red algae belonging to Rhodophyta, Rhodophyceae, Gigartinales, Halymeniaceae, is mainly distributed in the coastal warm temperate zone[8]. It is an edible and medicinal seaweed, usually used for treating sore throat, stomachache, ascariasis and seaworm infections and dysentery[9]. Red algae (Rhodophyta) are characterized by their content of non-fibrillar and sulfated polysaccharides such as carrageenans, agars and complex sulfated galactans, which are classified by their structural features[10,11]. Sulfated polysaccharides are acidic polysaccharides containing sulfate groups of natural and semi-synthetic anionic compounds[12]. GL polysaccharides are mainly composed of galactose linked with sulfate ester, and the exquisite structure including the replacement mode of sulfate ester is related to its bioactivities[13]. Many studies were performed to demonstrate that polysaccharides from the Grateloupia family had outstanding antioxidant and anticancer activities. Extracts from seaweed were found to have a strong antioxidant effect[14,15]and Grateloupia polysaccharides could inhibit  and U87 cell proliferation[17].To make the best use of effective polysaccharides and enhance their extraction yield, attention has been paid to the extraction methods of polysaccharides from plants and algae. Extraction methods developed include the ultrasound-, microwave-and enzyme-assisted extraction methods[18]. Considering its simple and economical conditions, hot water extraction[19]has been widely used as the classical method for polysaccharides extraction. However, hot water extraction involves a long time and high temperature, so the extraction method needs to be optimized.Response surface methodology (RSM) is an effective statistical technique for optimizing complex processes. The main advantage is to reduce the experimental trials needed to evaluate",

INTRODUCTION\n\nIn de novo molecular design, we seek to produce novel molecule libraries that meet required property profiles. Our aim is to create generative statistical models for molecular data that can capture the distributions of molecular compounds and generate a new set of valid compounds with the desired property requirements. Some notable advances in complete de novo drug design are established by Segler et al. [1] and Gupta et al. [2]; they introduce generative recurrent networks, which are trained on a large and diverse data set to recognize general features of molecules and fine-tuned on a smaller focused set active towards the desired target. Brown et al. [3] and Polykovsky et al. [4] attempt to compose standardized benchmarking frameworks with various generative models as well as distribution and property-based evaluation metrics.\n\nThe choice of a particular generative model depends on several aspects of the given task and materials. Considering data, the most common representation of a molecule is simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notation [5], which comprises ASCII characters structured by a special language rule. This specification immediately suggests the possibility of building SMILES-based language models, in which a SMILES character can be treated as a single token, a sequence of one or more tokens as a (meaningful) text or phrase, and the whole text data set as a language corpus. Inspired by such natural language models as n-grams and recurrent neural networks [6], we are free to simulate our own language framework capable of capturing SMILES fragments and generating novel sequences.",

Furthermore, exploring molecules with \"beyond-rule-of-5\" properties, common in natural products, has been considered a potential avenue for drug discovery. Therefore, natural products provide potential opportunities for modern drug discovery, including improving binding specificity and clinical trial progression [2].\n\nDefining and exploring chemical spaces is essential for facilitating the process of molecular discovery and can be operationalized through algorithmic approaches and machine learning.

The chemical space of natural products contains many different chemotypes, including lipids, alkaloids, sugars, flavonoids, polyketides, oxosteroids, coumarins, psoralenes, steroidal or cardiac glycosides and oligopeptides [1].\n\nThe importance of chemical space lies not only in its size but also in its diversity. This is especially true when the space contains molecules that meet the design objectives for various discovery tasks [4]. To achieve a diverse chemical space, it is important to select building blocks with unique or intriguing structural motifs. Simply relying on typical chemical processes may not produce enough compounds to adequately test.

Similarly, target-based and virtual screening methods can help identify potential biological targets for a given chemical compound or library, such as a natural product library.

To tackle this problem using machine learning methods, here we propose a novel and effective framework, known as GraphBP, to generate 3D molecules that bind to given proteins by placing atoms of specific types and locations to the given binding site one by one. In particular, at each step, we first employ a 3D graph neural network to obtain geometry-aware and chemically informative representations from the intermediate contextual information. Such context includes the given binding site and atoms placed in the previous steps. Second, to preserve the desirable equivariance property, we select a local reference atom according to the designed auxiliary classifiers and then construct a local spherical coordinate system. Finally, to place a new atom, we generate its atom type and relative location w.r.t. the constructed local coordinate system via a flow model. We also consider generating the variables of interest sequentially to capture the underlying dependencies among them. Experiments demonstrate that our GraphBP is effective to generate 3D molecules with binding ability to target protein binding sites.

It is highly promising to develop machine learning methods for this problem since there are recently available large-scale datasets of protein-ligand complex structures, such as PDB-Proceedings of the 39 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, PMLR 162, 2022. Copyright 2022 by the author(s).\n\nbind (Liu et al., 2017) and CrossDocked2020 (Francoeur et al., 2020). In addition, machine learning approaches have been shown to be effective for learning from richly structured data in biochemistry. The most representative example is AlphaFold (Jumper et al., 2021), which achieves remarkable accuracy on the problem of 3D protein structure prediction from amino acid sequence, a long-standing challenge for decades.",

The scaffold for this structure is provided by secondary structural elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable \"domains\" of secondary structure like hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops. In order create, i.e., design, a RNA for any given secondary structure, two or three bases would not be enough, but four bases are enough. This is likely why nature has \"chosen\" a four base alphabet: less than four does not allow to create all structures, while more than four bases are not necessary. Since RNA is charged, metal ions such as Mg2+ are needed to stabilise many secondary and tertiary structures.",

Such biosensors are promising analytical tools due to their wide range of detectable ligands and modular nature. However, designing biosensors tailored for applications of interest with the desired performance parameters, including ligand specificity, remains challenging. Biosensors often require significant engineering and tuning to meet desired specificity, sensitivity, dynamic range, and operating range parameters. Another limitation is the orthogonality of biosensors across hosts, given the role of the cellular context. Here, we describe recent advances and examples in the engineering and optimization of\u00a0TF-based biosensors for plug-and-play small molecule detection. We highlight novel developments in TF discovery and biosensor design, TF specificity engineering, and biosensor tuning, with emphasis on emerging computational methods.",

Yamada.\nPolysaccharides have been proven to be involved in the immune response in both anti-inflammation and pro-inflammation due to their distinct pharmacological properties. Recent studies showed that polysaccharides from Grateloupia livida (Harv.) Yamada possessed several biological activities, including anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenic, anti-cancer and antiviral. Our previous work has elucidated the structural features of the polysaccharides (named WGW) by combining ESI-MS with NMR and infrared (IR) spectroscopic analyses. The polysaccharides were mainly composed of galactose linked with sulfate ester, concluding to be \u03bc-carrageenan and \u03ba-carrageenan. The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunoregulation effects of WGW on macrophage RAW 264.7 cell. The cells were treated with WGW for different times, then Griess reagent was applied to detect the production of NO. The results presented that WGW induced the release of NO in large quantities (ranging from 2\u00a0\u00b5g/mL to 256\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) and improved the phagocytosis of macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, WGW have a predominant role in the improvement of proinflammatory mediators, such TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, iNOS, MMP-9 and COX2. Moreover, WGW activated NLRP3 inflammasome, in which MAPK/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway played an important role. These results indicated WGW might be a potential immuno-stimulation drug to promote inflammation.",

Recently, this plant has begun to attract attention due to its antioxidant properties. However, little is known about tea fermentation effect on antioxidant properties of this plant. Thus, to extend the tea fermentation study, in vitro sprout culture of this plant was established as a new feature model. This model plant was selected based on three reasons. Firstly, as a native tropical plant, to grow this plant in sub-tropic area is considered difficult. Secondly, the in vitro sprout culture is more genetically stable compared to other types of in vitro cultures. Thirdly, results showed that this in vitro sprout culture grew faster and produced higher biomass than in vitro tissue culture. Both characteristics are important in producing tea leaves. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was twofold. First was to establish high rosmarinic acid line of in vitro sprout culture of Orthosiphon aristatus by elicitation. Second was to evaluate the effect of tea fermentation on antioxidant properties of this plant. Results showed that yeast extract (5 g/L) elicitation resulted in the highest production of rosmarinic acid. This elicited plant was subjected to partial and full tea fermentation. Results revealed that both tea fermentations decreased the level of rosmarinic acid, total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and flavonols. These decreases were concomitant with reduced antioxidant activities as measured by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), and Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity assays. HPLC results showed that the longer the tea fermentation was, the greater reduction rosmarinic acid was found. High correlation value of 0.922 between rosmarinic acid and antioxidant activities was also observed. These results indicated that rosmarinic acid is the major contributor to the antioxidant activities of Orthosiphon aristatus. These results may provide useful information, in particular, for the food and pharmaceutical industries in the development of functional foods desiring maximum potential health benefits from Orthosiphon aristatus.

Here, we address about the issue of possible differences in the profiles of flavonoid compounds and their glycoconjugates derived from various plant materials grown in a standard culture media. We compared profiles of flavonoids isolated from seedling roots, hairy roots, and suspension root cell cultures of a model legume plant, Medicago truncatula. The analyses were conducted with plant isolates as well as the media. The LC/MS profiles of target natural products obtained from M. truncatula seedling roots, hairy roots, and suspension root cell cultures differed substantially. The most abundant compounds in seedlings roots were mono- and diglucuronides of isoflavones and/or flavones. This type of glycosylation was not observed in hairy roots or suspension root cell cultures. The only recognized glycoconjugates in the latter samples were glucose derivatives of isoflavones. Application of a high-resolution mass spectrometer helped evaluate the elemental composition of protonated molecules, such as [M\u00a0+\u00a0H](+). Comparison of collision-induced dissociation MS/MS spectra registered with a quadrupole time-of-flight analyzer for tissue extracts and standards allowed us to estimate the aglycone structure on the basis of the pseudo-MS(3) experiment. Structures of these natural products were described according to the registered mass spectra and literature data. The analyses conducted represent an overview of flavonoids and their conjugates in different types of plant material representing the model legume, M. truncatula.

However, among these four species, only pea catalyzes 3-O-methylation that converts the pterocarpanoid isoflavonoid 6a-hydroxymaackiain to pisatin. In pea, pisatin is important for chemical resistance to the pathogenic fungus Nectria hematococca. While barrel medic does not biosynthesize 6a-hydroxymaackiain, when cell suspension cultures are fed 6a-hydroxymaackiain, they accumulate pisatin. In vitro, hydroxyisoflavanone 4'-O-methyltransferase (HI4'OMT) from barrel medic exhibits nearly identical steady state kinetic parameters for the 4'-O-methylation of the isoflavonoid intermediate 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone and for the 3-O-methylation of the 6a-hydroxymaackiain isoflavonoid-derived pterocarpanoid intermediate found in pea. Protein x-ray crystal structures of HI4'OMT substrate complexes revealed identically bound conformations for the 2S,3R-stereoisomer of 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone and the 6aR,11aR-stereoisomer of 6a-hydroxymaackiain. These results suggest how similar conformations intrinsic to seemingly distinct chemical substrates allowed leguminous plants to use homologous enzymes for two different biosynthetic reactions. The three-dimensional similarity of natural small molecules represents one explanation for how plants may rapidly recruit enzymes for new biosynthetic reactions in response to changing physiological and ecological pressures.",

Based on the comparison of their amino acid sequences, M. truncatula defensins fell arbitrarily into three classes displaying extensive sequence divergence outside of the eight canonical cysteine residues. The presence of Class II defensins is reported for the first time in a legume plant. In silico as well as Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses indicated these genes were expressed in a variety of tissues including leaves, flowers, developing pods, mature seed and roots. The expression of these genes was differentially induced in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic stimuli. For the first time, a defensin gene (TC77480) was shown to be induced in roots in response to infection by the mycorrhizal fungus, Glomus versiforme. Northern blot analysis indicated that the tissue-specific expression patterns of the cloned Def1 and Def2 genes differed substantially between M. truncatula and M. sativa.

Such termination electrostatically repels the Mn12 molecules. Subsequently, a pattern of silicon dioxide is defined by LON.

Although targetaware generative models have made significant advances in drug design, they do not consider chemistry conditions and cannot guarantee the desired chemical properties. Unfortunately, merging the target-aware and chemical-aware models into a unified model to meet customized requirements may lead to the problem of negative transfer. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning in the NLP area, we use prefix embeddings to provide a novel generative model that considers both the targeted pocket's circumstances and a variety of chemical properties. All conditional information is represented as learnable features, which the generative model subsequently employs as a contextual prompt. Experiments show that our model exhibits good controllability in both single and multi-conditional molecular generation. The controllability enables us to outperform previous structure-based drug design methods. More interestingly, we open up the attention mechanism and reveal coupling relationships between conditions, providing guidance for multi-conditional molecule generation.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently, deep learning methods have shown promising potential for discovering desired drug molecules. Given that the order of drug-like spaces is 10 60 to 10 100 (Schneider & Fechner, 2005), de novo drug discovery is often described as finding a needle in a haystack. In recent years, numerous rule-based algorithms (Patel et al., 2009) to explore the chemical space have been presented; however, the computational overhead and results have been far from ideal. Inspired by the success of image, audio, and text generation models (Kiros et al., 2014;Baltru\u0161aitis et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2022e;Tan et al., 2023;Gao et al., 2023), researchers have recently turned to deep learning models to generate the desired molecules directly, eliminating the need to search the vast drug-like space Liu et al., 2022b). The critical issue in this type of research is determining how to control the behavior of the model to generate molecules with desired features.",

The \"drug-like\" structure generally means meeting the a set of criteria, such as good solubility, potency and molecular weight.\n\nIn the scope of small molecule drug design, it is essential to enable the generations to be guided by predefined conditions, such as the target protein. Here we formulate the molecular design problem as a conditional sequential generation given the target protein and propose a conditional Transformer architecture cTransformer that auto-regressively generates target-specific compounds. As shown in Figure 2, we first pre-train a transformer on the MOSES [9] dataset without target information (denoted as the base model), and after pretraining, the base model can generate drug-like structures. Then, the conditional transformer is fine-tuned on three targetspecific datasets (EGFR, HTR1A, and S1PR1 targets). Our experiment results show that the transformer is capable of generating compounds similar to the ones in the training set but are novel structures. We believe the conditional transformer to be a valuable tool for de novo molecule design. Note that our conditional transformer design is not limited to target proteins and can be generalized to a broader scope of targets.\n\nWe define our molecular design task as generating a valid SMILES string, which is not covered in training data and has desired potency and physicochemical properties. In order to address our task using deep learning, we summarize the challenges as follows: (1) the generated sequence is a valid drug-like structure in compliance with the SMILES grammar;\n\n(2) the generated chemical space covers enough variations that are likely to be new drugs; and (3) the generations can be guided by predefined conditions (incorporating the specified targets).",

HLA-DM binding to MHC stabilizes and protects from degradation, by covering hydrophobic surfaces. Antigen degradation could also ensue, resulting in an inability to bind to the peptide-binding groove. Thus, HLA-DM is needed to protect proteins against the lysosomal environment. CLIP release In order to ensure that no false peptides bind to an MHC class II molecule, the peptide-binding groove is occupied by a protein called CLIP. Once a proper peptide is encountered, HLA-DM catalyzes the exchange of CLIP for an antigen peptide. Often, this peptide is retrieved directly from the B cell receptor which internalized it. Through expulsion of CLIP at the proper time, HLA-DM ensures that the correct antigen can bind to MHC molecules and prevent either from degrading.",

Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no free edges.

We hypothesized that red leaf margins reduce leaf herbivory by signalling to herbivorous insects the presence of increased chemical defences. Leaves were collected from a natural population of Pseudowintera colorata. Margin size, herbivory damage, anthocyanin content and concentrations of polygodial, a sesquiterpene dialdehyde with antifeedant properties, were quantified. Feeding trials involving larvae of Ctenopseustis obliquana, a generalist herbivore, were conducted on red- and green-margined P. colorata leaves in darkness, or under white, green or red light. Leaves with wider red margins contained higher concentrations of polygodial and anthocyanins, and incurred less natural herbivory. In trials under white light, C. obliquana consumed disproportionately more green- than red-margined leaf laminae. Larvae exhibited no feeding preference when light was manipulated such that leaf colour discrimination was impaired. Red leaf margins provide a reliable and effective visual signal of chemical defence in P. colorata. Ctenopseustis obliquana larvae perceive and respond to the colour of the leaf margins, rather than to olfactory signals. Our study provides direct experimental evidence for aposematic coloration in red leaves.",

This first investigation of endophytic Actinobacteria in New Zealand targeted the culturally significant medicinal shrub Pseudowintera colorata (horopito) as a model plant. Community analysis in plant tissues collected from ten geographically distinct sites showed that tissue type had the strongest influence on diversity and richness of endophytic Actinobacteria. More denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands were obtained from stems (n\u2009=\u200918) compared to roots (n\u2009=\u200913). Sequencing analysis of the major bands (n\u2009=\u200920) identified them as uncultured bacteria, Streptomyces sp. and Angustibacter peucedani. Using two Actinobacteria-specific media, nine isolates were recovered from surface-sterilised P. colorata tissues. This was approximately 12% of the total taxa and correlated well with culturable numbers in international studies. In vitro analysis of the functionality of these strains showed that Streptomyces sp. PRY2RB2 inhibited all the tested phytopathogenic fungi (n\u2009=\u20094), Streptomyces sp. UKCW/B and Nocardia sp. TP1BA1B solubilised phosphate and produced siderophores. The functionality of the phosphate solubilising strains (n\u2009=\u20092) in vivo was investigated by inoculation of P. colorata seedlings. After 4\u00a0months, the mean shoot height of seedlings treated with Nocardia sp. TP1BA1B was 1.65\u00d7 longer, had higher shoot dry weight (1.6\u00d7) and number of internodes (1.67\u00d7) compared to control. This study identified for the first time a key group of endophytic Actinobacteria that are likely to be important in the ecology of New Zealand flora.",

Chiral pool synthesis is especially attractive for target molecules having similar chirality to a relatively inexpensive naturally occurring building-block such as a sugar or amino acid. However, the number of possible reactions the molecule can undergo is restricted and tortuous synthetic routes may be required (e.g. Oseltamivir total synthesis).

This generation tool can be combined with workflows for the screening of large numbers of molecules on the basis of computed molecular properties that fulfill certain criteria. We applied such a workflow to find molecules with potential to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs, using desirable optical properties as selection criteria. Results are shown for NDI's, PDI's, PTI1's, and PTI2's derivatives. The derivatives create a very diverse set of chromophores allowing panchromatic sensitization of the photoelectrode if adsorbed together on a semiconductor surface. The outcome is around 1400 derivatives that fulfill the criteria to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs. The workflow applied to NDI selects already known sensitizers out of 1015 structures, which shows its reliability. We also considered estimating the GSOP and ESOP by HOMO/ LUMO energy levels but observed that this simple procedure based on DFT(CAM-B3LYP) values is not predictive enough for this purpose. The CAT code is available as an open source and is thereby extendable to other applications, where systematic screening of compound derivatives is needed, like in the discovery of new photoswitches or in the discovery of new water oxidation catalysts. \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research has been financially supported by the NWO Solar to Products program (project number 733.000.007).

For the Calvin cycle to continue, RuBP (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) must be regenerated. So, 5 out of 6 carbons from the 2 G3P molecules are used for this purpose. Therefore, there is only 1 net carbon produced to play with for each turn. To create 1 surplus G3P requires 3 carbons, and therefore 3 turns of the Calvin cycle. To make one glucose molecule (which can be created from 2 G3P molecules) would require 6 turns of the Calvin cycle. Surplus G3P can also be used to form other carbohydrates such as starch, sucrose, and cellulose, depending on what the plant needs. Light-dependent regulation",

The chirality present in the auxiliary can bias the stereoselectivity of one or more subsequent reactions. The auxiliary can then be typically recovered for future use. Most biological molecules and pharmaceutical targets exist as one of two possible enantiomers; consequently, chemical syntheses of natural products and pharmaceutical agents are frequently designed to obtain the target in enantiomerically pure form. Chiral auxiliaries are one of many strategies available to synthetic chemists to selectively produce the desired stereoisomer of a given compound.",

It is particularly unusual in that its flowers come directly off the older stems rather than from among the leaves. It is a very slow growing plant that lacks the specialist water conducting tubes found in nearly all other flowering plants. The evergreen horopito plant is continually exposed to attack by various insects and parasites and its occurrence in high rainfall areas makes it particularly susceptible to attack by fungi. This has led to efficient built in defence mechanisms. Consequently, horopito has a rich source of secondary metabolites that have an interesting range of biologically active properties.

Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction.

Sugen developed small-molecule inhibitors of protein kinases, key enzymes in signal transduction and cellular decision-making. The main focus was on oncology, though the company had collaborations in other therapeutic areas. The concept of inhibiting kinases by small molecules that mimicked the ATP structure was generally thought to be infeasible when the company was founded (due to the high (mM) concentration of ATP in cells), and Sugen has been credited with pioneering this area, leading to protein kinases being the second most active area of drug development, largely based on ATP-competitive inhibitors. Sugen also had research programs on protein phosphatases, none of which led to therapeutics.",

It is a dematiaceous (darkly-pigmented) fungus characterized by slow growth and largely asexual reproduction. Cladosporium sphaerospermum consists of a complex of poorly morphologically differentiated, \"cryptic\" species that share many physiological and ecological attributes. In older literature, all of these sibling species were classified as C. sphaerospermum despite their unique nature. Accordingly, there is confusion in older literature reports on the physiological and habitat regularities of C. sphaerospermum in the strict sense. This fungus is most phylogenetically similar to C. fusiforme. According to modern phylogenetic analyses, the previously synonymized species, Cladosporium langeroni, is a distinct species.",

The indoor presence of this fungus can signify there is a condensation problem within the building such as on bathroom walls and in kitchens. Cladosporium sphaerospermum is also been shown to inhabit paint films on walls and other surfaces as well as old paintings. This fungus is also able to grow on gypsum-based material with and without paint and wallpaper. Plant materials that are affected include citrus leaves on various other decaying plant leaves, on the stems of herbaceous and woody plants, on fruits and vegetables.

These chemometric approaches with multivariate analysis enable researchers to understand and quantify the relationship between the variables in a data set, and the analysis\u00a0considers more than one factor. The concentrations of Cu, Na, Mn, Zn, and Pb in most Z. clinopodioides samples were below the WHO (world health organization) limit for herbal medicines (10, 51,340, 200, 50, and 10\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0g<sup-1</sup respectively), while Fe and Ca levels were higher than allowed (15 and 614\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0g<sup-1</sup respectively). However, the WHO limit for Mg, K, Co, and Mo in medicinal plants has not yet been determined. The results of this study confirmed that different parts of Z. clinopodioides can be used as an important source for human nutrition due to its essential mineral elements.",

This study aims to isolate acacetin, a flavonoid, from the aerial part of Z. clinopodioides, to develop an HPLC method for its detection, and to evaluate its protective effects on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Sephadex LH-20 silicagel and pillar layer chromatography silica gel were applied for the isolation and purification of acacetin and its structure was elucidated on the basis of (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The content of acacetin in Z. clinopodioides collected from three different origins was determined by HPLC. The neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured in vitro to establish a hypoxia/reoxygenation injury model. The viability of cardiomyocytes was measured by the MTT method. Changes of malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the medium were also determined. The acacetin content in various batches of Z. clinopodioides ranged from 45.50 to 47.41\u00a0\u03bcg/g. Acacetin of 25, 10, 5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL significantly decreased the MDA content in a model of hypoxia/reoxygenation injury (P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.001 and P\u2009=\u20090.033, respectively).

Chromatographic separation is achieved by using HPLC system consisting of a Shimadzu LC-6AD and Kromasil C(18) column (150 x 4.6 mm, 10 mum, with pre-column), the mobile phase consists of methanol and 0.03 M phosphate buffer (pH = 3, 90:10). Detection wavelength is 214 nm. The speed of flow is 0.5 ml/min. The specimen handing quantity is 10 mul. The oleanolic acid's linearity range is 0.4 ~ 1.2 mg/ml (r = 0.9996). The ursolic acid's linearity range is 0.6 ~ 1.8 mg/ml (r = 0.9996), and the linear relationship is accurate. The average recovery (n = 6) of oleanolic acid is 99.5% (RSD = 1.19%) and ursolic acid is 102.3% (RSD = 1.25%). The content of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid in Ziziphora clinopodioides are 0.76 mg/g and 1.176 mg/g, respectively. The developed HPLC method can therefore be applied to both in vitro studies of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid formulations as well as drug estimation in biological samples.",

Current study is believed to first time report the potential of Z. clinopodioides extracts to ameliorate joint inflammation using model of chronic joint inflammation (FCA-induced rheumatoid arthritis). The study further investigates the effects on joint inflammation using acute inflammatory paw edema models. The anti-inflammatory effects were also supported by using xylene-induced ear edema model. Results showed that Z. clinopodioides significantly ameliorated rheumatoid arthritis as indicated by the inhibition of arthritic development and paw edema. Histopathological examination showed significant attenuation in pannus formation, bone erosion, and joint inflammation. Treatment with the plant extracts also nearly normalized counts of RBCs, platelets, and total leukocytes along with hemoglobin (Hb) content. Biochemical analysis (AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine) showed that plant extracts did not possess hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic effects. Water displacement plethysmometric analysis showed that Z. clinopodioides significantly attenuated carrageenan-induced paw edema. To evaluate the mechanism, anti-inflammatory effects were further evaluated using histamine- and serotonin-induced inflammatory paw edema models. Z. clinopodioides significantly suppressed paw edema induced by both histamine and serotonin, and also caused the inhibition of xylene-induced ear edema. This suggested the inhibition of autacoids as one of the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects of plant. GC-MS analysis showed that the plant is rich in essential oils, including terpenoids, esters, alcohols, furans, cyclic ketones, epoxides, oxanes, and acyclic hydrocarbons. In conclusion, current study demonstrated that Z. clinopodioides possessed significant anti-arthritic and anti-inflammatory properties which might be attributed to the inhibition of autacoids.",

Sugar molecules are attached to the dolichol through a pyrophosphate linkage (one phosphate was originally linked to dolichol, and the second phosphate came from the nucleotide sugar). The oligosaccharide chain is then extended through the addition of various sugar molecules in a stepwise manner to form a precursor oligosaccharide.

Lennarz and his lab mates discovered that these sugars are transferred as a group, and are synthesized from a dolichol-linked oligosaccharide with a conserved structure. They found the precursor for these molecules had the structure (Man)nGlcNAcB1,4 \u2192GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, and each precursor had at least five mannose residues.

Structural data on the IL-33 molecule was determined by solution NMR and small angle X-ray scattering.",

Specifically, when a molecular structure is said to be represented by a resonance hybrid, it does not mean that electrons of the molecule are \"resonating\" or shifting back and forth between several sets of positions, each one represented by a Lewis structure. Rather, it means that the set of contributing structures represents an intermediate structure (a weighted average of the contributors), with a single, well-defined geometry and distribution of electrons.

For a system with n electrons and n orbitals, Rumer's method involves arranging the orbitals in a circle and connecting the orbitals together with lines that do not intersect one another. Covalent, or uncharged, structures can be created by connecting all of the orbitals with one another. Ionic, or charged, structures for a given atom can be determined by assigning a charge to a molecule, and then following Rumer's method. For the case of butadiene, the 20 possible Rumer structures are shown, where 1 and 2 are the covalent structures, 3-14 are the monoionic structures, and 15-20 are the diionic structures.

(Asteraceae).\nThe multipronged nuclear DNA assay by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting, ribosomal DNA repeat unit length polymorphism, internal transcribed sequence (ITS) RFLP, and comparative sequence analysis of ITS and external transcribed sequence (ETS) regions of the 29 accessions belonging to 18 Carthamus taxa including five unverified species was undertaken to obtain new information on (1) interrelationships among botanical varieties of cultivated safflower, C. tinctorius, and phylogenetic relationships (2) among the safflower and its close relatives and (3) that of Carthamus species and subspecies. The root tip cells of the 12 accessions contained 24 chromosomes followed by 64, 44 and 20 chromosomes in 9, 6 and 2 accessions, respectively. Barring C. lanatus, the accessions within each taxon had the same zygotic number. The present results strongly support the view that the wild C. palaestinus (2n=24) and the cultivated C. tinctorius (2n=24) are closely related. With few exceptions, all DNA based dendrograms support three lineages within the genus. One lineage is constituted by C. arborescens (2n=24) alone. The present data indicates that because of unique composition of its nuclear genome vis-\u00e0-vis other Carthamus taxa, C. arborescens should be placed in a separate subgenus. The two remaining lineages, constituted by the taxa with 2n=24, and the taxa with 2n=20, 2n=44 and 2n=64, respectively should be given the rank of two taxonomic sections in the other subgenus. The present study also demonstrates that none of the present taxa with 2n=24 have contributed to the origin of polyploid taxa. Carthamus boisserii (2n=20) and C. glaucus ssp. anatolicus (2n=20) are more likely to be one of the diploid progenitor of C. lanatus ssp. creticus (2n=64), C. lanatus (2n=44), C. lanatus ssp. lanatus (2n=44) and C. lanatus ssp. montanus (2n=44), and C. lanatus ssp. turkestanicus (2n=64), respectively. Within Lanatus species complex, constituted by C. lanatus, C. lanatus ssp. lanatus, C. lanatus ssp. montanus, C. lanatus ssp. turkestanicus and C. lanatus ssp. creticus, high proportion of autapomorphic characters and low number of synapomorphies in the ITS and ETS sequences suggest a relatively recent diversification of the taxa within the species complex. Carthamus lanatus ssp. creticus (2n=64) and C. lanatus ssp. turkestanicus (2n=64) within the complex deserve species rank. This analysis provided evolutionary relatedness of the five unverified taxa with the known Carthamus taxa.",

It begins with the reduction of an anthraquinone (such as 2-ethylanthraquinone or the 2-amyl derivative) to the corresponding anthrahydroquinone, typically by hydrogenation on a palladium catalyst. In the presence of oxygen, the anthrahydroquinone then undergoes autoxidation: the labile hydrogen atoms of the hydroxy groups transfer to the oxygen molecule, to give hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone. Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling compressed air through a solution of the anthrahydroquinone, with the hydrogen peroxide then extracted from the solution and the anthraquinone recycled back for successive cycles of hydrogenation and oxidation.

Rubiadin, a 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methyl anthraquinone, primarily originates from <iRubia cordifolia</i Linn (Rubiaceae). It was first discovered in 1981 and has been reported for many biological activities. However, no review has been reported so far to create awareness about this molecule and its role in future drug discovery. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide comprehensive evidence of Rubiadin's phytochemistry, biosynthesis, physicochemical properties, biological properties and therapeutic potential. Relevant literature was gathered from numerous scientific databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar between 1981 and up-to-date. The distribution of Rubiadin in numerous medicinal plants, as well as its method of isolation, synthesis, characterisation, physiochemical properties and possible biosynthesis pathways, was extensively covered in this review. Following a rigorous screening and tabulating, a thorough description of Rubiadin's biological properties was gathered, which were based on scientific evidences. Rubiadin fits all five of Lipinski's rule for drug-likeness properties. Then, the in depth physiochemical characteristics of Rubiadin were investigated. The simple technique for Rubiadin's isolation from <iR. cordifolia</i and the procedure of synthesis was described. Rubiadin is also biosynthesized via the polyketide and chorismate/o-succinylbenzoic acid pathways. Rubiadin is a powerful molecule with anticancer, antiosteoporotic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antibacterial, antimalarial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. The mechanism of action for the majority of the pharmacological actions reported, however, is unknown. In addition to this review, an in silico molecular docking study was performed against proteins with PDB IDs: 3AOX, 6OLX, 6OSP, and 6SDC to support the anticancer properties of Rubiadin. The toxicity profile, pharmacokinetics and possible structural modifications were also described. Rubiadin was also proven to have the highest binding affinity to the targeted proteins in an in silico study; thus, we believe it may be a potential anticancer molecule. In order to present Rubiadin as a novel candidate for future therapeutic development, advanced studies on preclinical, clinical trials, bioavailability, permeability and administration of safe doses are necessary.",

While this specification allowed for facile annotation of bonds with properties and descriptors, it resulted in significant search performance hits, forcing us to reconsider elements of our specification. As a result, we have created a test set where, apart from specifying explicit bonds, we also linked bonded atom instances with the appropriate bidirectional relationships that corresponded to bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic). This improved performance considerably and allowed us to carry out our tests. Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2). It must be noted that answering this query in a typical SPARQL engine involves the exhaustive examination of all the candidate molecules that may potentially contain a collection of atoms that satisfy the laid out bonding criteria. Unfortunately, since the SPARQL query engines currently available have not been explicitly optimized chemical searching needs, they often lack many of the mechanisms developed over the past decades to accelerate the solution of this problem, and resemble the brute force approach to graph matching more closely.\n\nAppendix 2.

From six-dimensional solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we show that diffraction of H<sub2</sub molecules under fast grazing incidence conditions could be even more informative for the characterization of ionic surfaces, due to the large anisotropic electrostatic interaction between the quadrupole moment of the molecule and the electric field created by the ionic crystal. Using the LiF(001) surface as a benchmark, we show that fast grazing incidence diffraction of H<sub2</sub strongly depends on the initial rotational state of the molecule, while rotationally inelastic processes are irrelevant. We demonstrate that, as a result of the anisotropy of the impinging projectile, initial rotational excitation leads to an increase in intensity of high-order diffraction peaks at incidence directions that satisfy precise symmetry constraints, thus providing a more detailed information on the surface characteristics than that obtained from low-order atomic diffraction peaks under fast grazing incidence conditions. As quadrupole-ion surface potentials are expected to accurately represent the interaction between H<sub2</sub and any surface with a marked ionic character, our analysis should be of general applicability to any of such surfaces.

Antioxidant molecules slow the process of aging either by preventing free radicals from oxidizing sensitive biological molecules or by reducing the formation of free radicals and quenching the already formed reactive oxygen species [ROS) [10]. Consequently, cosmetology has a significant role in the prevention and attenuation of skin aging through the formulation of new substances with effective antioxidant activity, to be incorporated on cosmetic products for daily care [11]. Topical supplementation with antioxidants is regarded as a useful strategy that may improve skin antioxidant capacity to reduce ROS induced skin damages [12]. The antioxidant activity of the sea cucumber, Holothuria arenicola has been evident and up to date, there is no cosmetics formulation for such sea cucumber in Egypt. Thereby, the main objective of the present investigation was to develop a topical skincare cream [w/o) loaded with the sea cucumber, Holothuria arenicola extract [HaE).\n\n\nMaterial and methods\n\n\nSample collection and preparation\n\nSea cucumbers (Holothuria arenicola) were collected from Abu-Qir Bay in the Egyptian Mediterranean coast at the eastern Alexandrian coast (May-June 2020). The animals were transported to our laboratory in an icebox containing ice cubes and a few pinches of table salt. The animals were immediately washed under running tap water and cut open, and all visceral organs were removed and then the body walls of the animals were stored at -20\u00b0C until processing. The phosphate buffer extract was prepared according to the method of Yasumoto et al. [13]. The body wall of the animals animals was cut into small parts and blended in phosphate buffer (in a volume = 4 ml \u00d7 tissue weight) and extracted at room temperature (25\u00b0C) with pH 7.2 for 5 hours, the filtered was collected. The collected, filtered off the Sea cucumbers concentrated and lyophilized using a lyophilizer (LABCONCO, shell freeze system, USA).\n\n\nFormulation of animal Ointments",

While being a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron, it is not classified or approved as an antiemetic. Since stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors is positively correlated with gastrointestinal motility, alosetron's 5-HT3 antagonism slows the movement of fecal matter through the large intestine, increasing the extent to which water is absorbed, and decreasing the moisture and volume of the remaining waste products. History Alosetron was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2000, after a seven-month review. At the time of the initial approval U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers found that alosetron improved symptoms in 10% to 20% of patients.",

Serotonin is secreted by enterochromaffin (EC) cells and acts on receptors located on smooth muscles, enterocytes and nerves (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT7). Enterocytes express the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), which terminate the action of 5-HT. There are lines of evidence that functional gastrointestinal disorders, as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are associated with defective enteric serotonergic signaling. Plasma level and mucosal cells containing EC are increased in diarrhea predominant IBS. Serotonin reuptake transporter expression in colonic mucosa is significantly reduced in IBS. Moreover, 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists seem to be effective in the treatment of symptoms of IBS. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists--alosetrone, granisetrone, ondansetrone--modulate visceral sensitivity and slow intestinal transit. They have proved to be effective in diarrhea predominant IBS. 5-HT4 agonists--tegaserode, prucalopride--relieve abdominal pain and bloating and improve intestinal transit in constipation predominant IBS. 5-HT4 antagonist--piboserode--is being investigated for a diarrhea predominant IBS.",

Chronic abdominal pain or discomfort relieved by defecation and associated with altered bowel habits are the mainstay in diagnosis. The pathophysiology of IBS remains unknown. This biopsychosocial disorder involves dysregulation of the nervous system, altered intestinal motility, and increased visceral sensitivity. All of these result from dysregulation of the bidirectional communication between the gut with its enteric nervous system and the brain (the brain-gut axis), modulated by various psychosocial and environmental factors (e.g. infection, inflammation). Numerous neurotransmitters are found in the brain and gut that regulate GI activities, including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and its 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. The current approach to IBS patients is based on a positive diagnosis of the symptom complex, exclusion of underlying organic disease, and institution of a therapeutic trial. Traditional symptomatic treatment has included antidiarrheals, laxatives and bulking agents/fiber, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, antispasmodics for pain, and \"alternative\" therapies (e.g. psychotherapy, hypnotherapy). The scientific evidence supporting this therapy is limited. Novel approaches include visceral analgesics and serotonin agonists and antagonists. In patients with severe diarrhea, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (e.g. alosetron) and selective M3-type anticholinergics are indicated, in constipation 5-HT4 agonists (e.g. tegaserod), and in pain alfa2-adrenergics (e.g. clonidine), cholecystokinin antagonists, kappa-opioid agonists (e.g. fedotozine), and neurokinin antagonists; some of these agents are still being investigated.

In this regard, conventional treatment has been recognised as unsatisfactory for many patients with IBS and novel, neuroenteric modulatory compounds have been introduced for use by clinicians. Specifically, compounds interacting with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype have been demonstrated of benefit in some patients for the treatment of IBS. In this leading article, we present the current data on the pharmacology, clinical trials, indications and adverse effects of alosetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3 antagonist. As a result of the recognition of serious adverse effects, the indication for alosetron has been restricted and it is now indicated only for women with severe diarrhoea-predominant IBS who have symptoms for at least 6 months and who have failed to respond to conventional therapy.

There is no single pathophysiological marker of IBS although it is generally accepted that some patients do have abnormalities of intestinal motility and/or enhanced visceral sensitivity. There is also an increasing acceptance that the central nervous system, an important component of the brain-gut axis, also plays an important role in symptom production both in the response to stress and when there is an underlying affective disorder. During the past decade new therapeutic targets have been identified that have permitted the development of new drugs with therapeutic potential for IBS. Identification and characterization of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors in the gastrointestinal tract particularly 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, which are involved not only in modulating gut motility but in visceral sensory pathways, has led to a number of studies of 5-HT3 (Alosetron, Granisetron and Ondansetron) and 5-HT4 (SB-207266A) antagonists. Both classes of drug appear to reduce visceral sensitivity and have inhibitory effects on motor activity in the distal intestine. Early clinical studies suggest that these agents may have a role in painful, diarrhoea-predominant IBS. 5-HT4 agonists (HTF919, Zelmac) may improve constipation-predominant IBS by normalizing bowel habit and thereby reducing abdominal pain. Alternative approaches to reducing visceral sensation include the use of the opioid kappa agonists, which have no central opioid effects although clinical trials have suggested that these agents are not highly effective in relieving IBS pain. There are in addition, new approaches to modify intestinal motility including the development of gut selective muscarinic M3 receptor antagonists such as zamifenacin and the 5-HT4 partial agonist, HTF919. Preliminary studies suggest that these agents may have therapeutic potential in IBS. Anti-depressants are increasingly used to treat affective disorder in IBS but in addition appear to have added value because of their ability to reduce visceral hypersensitivity and alter gut transit. Therapeutic effects are often obtained at doses below those normally used to treat depression. IBS continues to be a therapeutic challenge because of its diverse symptomatology and lack of a single pathophysiological target for drug intervention.",

In experimental studies, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been reported to slow colon transit, to blunt gastrocolonic reflex, and to reduce rectal sensitivity. Alosetron and cilansetron, potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, have proven efficacy in the treatment of IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D). However, alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn due to postmarketing reports of ischemic colitis and complications of constipation, and cilansetron was never marketed. Currently alosetron is available under a risk management program for women with severe IBS-D. Ramosetron is another potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, which has been marketed in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. In animal studies, ramosetron reduced defecation induced by corticotrophin-releasing hormone and had inhibitory effects on colonic nociception. In two randomized controlled studies including 957 patients with IBS-D, ramosetron increased monthly responder rates of patient-reported global assessment of IBS symptom relief compared with placebo. Ramosetron was also as effective as mebeverine in male patients with IBS-D. In a recent randomized controlled trial with 343 male patients with IBS-D, ramosetron has proved effective in improving stool consistency, relieving abdominal pain/discomfort, and improving health-related quality of life. Regarding safety, ramosetron is associated with a lower incidence of constipation compared with other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and has not been associated with ischemic colitis. Although further large prospective studies are needed to assess whether ramosetron is effective for female patients with IBS-D and to evaluate its long-term safety, ramosetron appears to be one of the most promising agents for patients with IBS-D.

Traditional efficacy outcomes in drug development for IBS include the ability of the compound to affect GI tract motility (i.e. to exert a prokinetic or an antispasmodic effect), which is thought to be of importance if a motor disorder is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. More recently, altered visceral sensitivity to a distending stimulus has been suggested to be a key pathophysiological feature, at least in some patients, and has become a target for therapeutic interventions. However, there is now growing consensus that the primary outcome measure in the treatment of functional disorders are those that reflect overall control of the patient's symptoms (pain, diarrhoea, constipation) in everyday situations such as the clinical global improvement scales. Although, in general, guidelines on the design of treatment trials for functional GI tract disorders advise against subcategorisation of patients according to the main symptom (because of symptom instability), subcategorisation indeed makes sense especially in IBS (constipation- or diarrhoea-predominant). Compounds with a specific indication for each subpopulation of patients are now emerging. The rationale for investigations on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) receptor ligands in IBS rests mainly on the fact that serotonin, which may be released by enterochromaffin-like cells in the GI tract as well as from other sources, has a number of well documented motor effects on the GI tract and can produce hyperalgesia in several experimental models. Serotonin receptors belonging to the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype are the most extensively studied in gastroenterology, although hitherto 'orphan' receptor subtypes, such as the 5-HT7 and the 5-HT(1B/D) receptors, are now emerging. Among 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, alosetron was recently approved for the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant IBS and is an example of a compound that, at least theoretically, may act at multiple levels: by inhibiting visceral sensitivity, by increasing compliance, and by inhibiting excitatory 5-HT3 receptors located on both ascending and descending neuronal pathways involved in peristalsis. For this reason, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may slow transit, hence the specific indication of alosetron in diarrhoea-predominant IBS. However, alosetron has been recently withdrawn by the manufacturer because of safety concerns. Hypomotility remains an attractive therapeutic target in IBS and the new generation of prokinetics includes several partial agonists at the 5-HT4 receptor, such as tegaserod (HTF-919) and prucalopride (R0-93877). In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that 5-HT4 receptors may also be involved in the modulation of visceral sensitivity. Second-generation 5-HT4 receptor agonists seem to be devoid of the QT-prolonging effects observed in some clinical circumstances with cisapride and may be more active at the colonic level. Piboserod (SB-207266A) is a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of diarrhoea-predominant IBS. Finally, interest in 5-HT7 and 5-HT(1B/D) receptor subtypes stems from the observation that the former receptors mediate smooth muscle relaxation (at least in the human colon), whereas sumatriptan (a 5-HT(1B/D) receptor agonist) can affect GI tract motility and visceral sensitivity.",

This activity can be triggered by luminal stimuli that are detected by nerves via epithelial intermediation. Epithelial enterochromaffin cells act as sensory transducers that activate the mucosal processes of both intrinsic and extrinsic primary afferent neurones through their release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Intrinsic primary afferent neurones are present in both the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. Peristaltic and secretory reflexes are initiated by submucosal intrinsic primary afferent neurones, which are stimulated by 5-HT acting at 5-HT(1P) receptors. 5-HT acting at 5-HT4 receptors enhances the release of transmitters from their terminals and from other terminals in prokinetic reflex pathways. Signalling to the central nervous system is predominantly 5-HT3 mediated, although serotonergic transmission within the enteric nervous system and the activation of myenteric intrinsic primary afferent neurones are also 5-HT3 mediated. The differential distribution of 5-HT receptor subtypes makes it possible to use 5-HT3 antagonists and 5-HT4 agonists to treat intestinal discomfort and motility. 5-HT3 antagonists alleviate the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy and the discomfort from the bowel in irritable bowel syndrome; however, because 5-HT-mediated fast neurotransmission within the enteric nervous system and the stimulation of mucosal processes of myenteric intrinsic primary afferent neurones are 5-HT3 mediated, 5-HT3 antagonists tend to be constipating and should be used only when pre-existing constipation is not a significant component of the problem to be treated. In contrast, 5-HT4 agonists, such as tegaserod, are safe and effective in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic constipation. They do not stimulate nociceptive extrinsic nerves nor initiate peristaltic and secretory reflexes. Instead, they rely on natural stimuli to activate reflexes, which they strengthen by enhancing the release of transmitters in prokinetic pathways. Finally, when all the signalling by 5-HT is over, its action is terminated by uptake into enterocytes or neurones, which is mediated by the serotonin reuptake transporter. In inflammation, serotonergic signalling is specifically diminished in the mucosa. Transcripts encoding tryptophan hydroxylase-1 and serotonin reuptake transporter are both markedly decreased. Successive potentiation of 5-HT and/or desensitization of its receptor could account for the symptoms seen in diarrhoea-predominant and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, respectively. Symptoms associated with the down-regulation of the serotonin reuptake transporter in the human mucosa in irritable bowel syndrome are similar to the symptoms associated with the knockout of the serotonin reuptake transporter in mice. The observation that molecular defects occur in the human gut in irritable bowel syndrome strengthens the hand of those seeking to legitimize the disease. At least it is not 'all in your head'.

New findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptors exist on gut afferent neurones and that their activation by locally released 5-HT leads to visceral nociceptive stimulation, in addition to increased neuronally-mediated motor and secretory activity. If this concept is validated, it will provide a rationale for the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in patients with increased gut motility, reduced fluid absorption and low nociceptive thresholds leading to abdominal pain. Alosetron is a highly selective, potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which is well absorbed with a long pharmacodynamic half-life.

In this study we evaluated the effects of intravenous and intracerebroventricular administration of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, alosetron, on blood pressure changes associated with rectal distension in anesthetized and awake dogs. This vasoactive reflex serves as a model for visceral nociception. For intracerebroventricular studies, the cerebroventricular guides were placed over the lateral ventricle. In anesthetized studies, blood pressure was measured by femoral artery cannulation. In awake studies, blood pressure was monitored by noninvasive measurement. A rectal balloon was placed in the rectum of each dog and maintained throughout the experiments. Each dose of alosetron was given to the dogs as an intravenous or intracerebroventricular bolus, and every 30 min the rectal balloon was inflated and blood pressure responses observed. In both anesthetized and awake dogs alosetron produced a significant inhibition of the vasoactive reflex. In particular, alosetron showed high potency when administered intracerebroventricularly.

Altered serotonin signaling may lead to both intestinal and extra intestinal systems in IBS. In this review, the literature related to role of serotonin signaling in pathophysiology of IBS has been searched and summarized. Therapeutic agents targeting altered serotonin signaling may provide new effective treatment for patients with IBS. Tegaserod, 5-HT(4) partial agonist is used in constipation predominant IBS while alosetron, a 5-HT(3) antagonist used in IBS with diarrhea. Other compounds such as tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors have been used in some patients with IBS.",

Improvement in bowel movement frequency and consistency was achieved and pain was relieved by 1 week. During 12 weeks of treatment, alosetron was shown to elicit significant relief of abdominal pain and discomfort compared with placebo or mebeverine in female IBS patients with diarrhea. Alosetron slowed colonic transit and treatment efficacy was apparent after a week of treatment.

Antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptors in the peripheral and central nervous system is a probable mechanism of action.

A number of receptor or recognition sites have been identified in the gut, but recently most attention has focused on the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. The functional role of the 5-HT3 receptor remains incompletely understood, but it is probably involved in the modulation of colonic motility and visceral pain in the gut. A number of selective 5-HT3 antagonists have been developed including ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron renzapride and zacopride. While the substituted benzamide prokinetics (for example, metoclopramide, cisapride) also block 5-HT3 receptors in high concentrations, their prokinetic action is believed to be on the basis of their agonist effects on the putative 5-HT4 receptor. Some 5-HT3 antagonists have 5-HT4 agonist activity (for example, renzapride, zacopride) and others do not (for example, ondansetron, granisetron), while tropisetron in high concentrations is a 5-HT4 antagonist. Based on the pharmacological data, it has been suggested that specific 5-HT antagonists and agonists may prove to be beneficial in a number of gastrointestinal disorders including the irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, non-cardiac chest pain, gastrooesophageal reflux and refractory nausea.

This ability appears to be caused by the secretion of serotonin (5-HT) by enterochromaffin (EC) cells of the mucosal epithelium. This 5-HT is secreted into the wall of the gut, where it stimulates the mucosal processes of intrinsic and extrinsic primary afferent neurons. The intrinsic primary afferents, which are activated by 5-HT1P/4 receptors, initiate peristaltic and secretory reflexes. The extrinsic primary afferent neurons send distress and other signals to the central nervous system. Extrinsic nerves are activated by 5-HT(3) receptors. The 5-HT that is involved in mucosal signaling is inactivated by uptake into mucosal epithelial cells, which are mediated by an integral membrane protein called the serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). The epithelial SERT is the same molecule as that which transports 5-HT in the central and enteric nervous systems. Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal enteric release or inactivation of 5-HT is involved in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Spread of 5-HT to inappropriate sites in IBS may activate 5-HT(3) receptors on extrinsic afferent fibers and motor neurons, giving rise to visceral hypersensitivity and abnormal motility, respectively. A potent 5-HT(3) antagonist, such as alosetron, can prevent both of these effects and is therefore useful in treating IBS. 5-HT also appears to function as a growth factor in the development of enteric neurons. The developmental effects of 5-HT are mediated by the 5-HT(2B) receptor, which is developmentally regulated. The importance of serotonergic mechanisms in enteric physiology probably accounts for the gastrointestinal \"side effects\" of compounds that inhibit SERT. The newly discovered role of 5-HT in enteric neuronal development suggests that drugs that interfere with the action or inactivation of 5-HT should be used in pregnancy only with extreme caution, if at all.",

We determined the effect of Alos on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the absence and presence of rectal or sigmoid stimulation to evaluate 2 hypothesized mechanisms of therapeutic action: peripheral antinociception and inhibition of emotional motor system (EMS) regions in the brain. Forty-nine nonconstipated irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients (26 female) received H(2)(15)O positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans before a randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-week trial with Alos (1-4 mg twice daily). PET scans were repeated after treatment in 37 completers. We assessed rCBF during baseline, rectal distention, and anticipation of undelivered rectal distention. The 3 conditions were repeated after a series of noxious sigmoid distentions. Rectal (45 mm Hg) and sigmoid (60 mm Hg) distentions were performed with a computer-controlled barostat device. Alos treatment, as compared with placebo, improved IBS symptoms and reduced rCBF in 5-HT3R containing regions of the EMS, but not in areas activated by pain. Reduction of rCBF appeared greatest in the absence of visceral stimulation, and was partially reversed by rectal or sigmoid distention. Symptom improvement across sessions was significantly correlated with rCBF decreases in the 5-HT3R-rich amygdala, ventral striatum, and dorsal pons. Reduction in IBS symptoms correlated with a drug-induced reduction in the activity of central autonomic networks mediating emotional expression that was maximal in the absence of nociceptive input.",

Antagonists of the type 3 serotonin receptor (5-HT3) have shown promising results in the relief of IBS-associated symptoms. We aimed to confirm these findings by doing a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. We studied 647 female IBS patients with diarrhoea-predominant or alternating bowel patterns (diarrhoea and constipation). 324 patients were assigned 1 mg alosetron and 323 placebo orally twice daily for 12 weeks, followed by a 4-week post-treatment period. Adequate relief of abdominal pain and discomfort was the primary endpoint; secondary endpoints included improvements in urgency, stool frequency, and stool consistency. Analysis was by intention to treat. 79 (24%) of patients in the alosetron group and 53 (16%) in the placebo group dropped out. The difference in the drop-out rate between groups was mainly due to a greater occurrence of constipation in the alosetron group. A greater proportion of alosetron-treated patients than placebo-treated patients (133 [41%] vs 94 [29%], respectively) reported adequate relief for all 3 months of treatment (difference 12% [4.7-19.2]). Alosetron also significantly decreased urgency and stool frequency, and increased stool firmness. Constipation occurred in 30% and 3% of patients in the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. Alosetron was well tolerated and clinically effective in alleviating pain and bowel-related symptoms in this population of women with IBS.",

Patients were treated for 7 days with placebo (n = 6), alosetron 0.25 mg b.d. (n = 8) or alosetron 4 mg b.d. (n = 8). On day 6, a barostat bag was placed in the left colon. On day 7, after an overnight fast, isobaric phasic distensions were performed (4 mmHg steps, 5 min) up to the step triggering a sensation of abdominal pain. Groups were comparable at inclusion (age, sex, symptoms, bowel habits). There were no differences between treatment groups in pressure recorded within the bag at the time of first sensation of abdominal pain. However, bag volumes were significantly increased. At the first sensation threshold, median volume differences of 61 mL and 90 mL (P = 0.028) were recorded with alosetron 0.25 mg b.d. and 4 mg b.d., respectively.

To determine the in vitro effect of alosetron on neuromuscular transmission in the canine and human jejunal and colonic muscularis externa. Alosetron diminished electrical field-stimulated (EFS) contractions recorded from muscles of the canine and human small and large intestines. Mechanistically, the diminished EFS response could be explained by the ability of alosetron to decrease the fractional release of 14C-choline radiolabelled acetylcholine evoked by EFS from human jejunal muscle. The inhibition of EFS contractions was not limited to atropine-sensitive events, as non-cholinergic excitatory EFS evoked contractions were also inhibited. Additionally, alosetron at high concentrations (&gt; 30 microM) directly altered bethanechol stimulated contractions. Caution must be used in the interpretation of these data because significant alterations in EFS-induced contractions were only observed with large pharmacological concentrations of alosetron, and the response was not selective for cholinergically-mediated excitatory neuromuscular transmission.",

Despite increasing knowledge about the biologic principles, even on the molecular level, the more we learn about the precise mechanisms of their interactions the more questions arise. It is also pertinent to remember that clinical scientists studying pain modulating pharmacologic agents always have to consider possible placebo effects [57-61]. Most of our knowledge regarding the function of neurotransmitter systems in the CNS has been provided by animal studies. Thus we cannot be sure that they have exactly parallel counterparts in humans. For instance, animal studies suggest an inverse relationship between brain and spinal cord concentrations of substance P. If these observations are converted to an interpretation of human fibromyalgia, low brain-tissue levels of both serotonin and substance P should be expected, while spinal cord serotonin concentrations would be low and spinal cord substance P would be high [1]. There is good evidence that 5-HT, its receptors, and their interactions with other neurotransmitters are essential for nociception and antinociception. The activities of 5-HT receptors can be studied by agonist and in humans especially by antagonist use. But even with a direct spinal application of selective agonists and antagonists, observations may still be confounded by (1) dose, as there can be a dose-dependent activation of different receptor subtypes; (2) type of nociceptive tests (e.g., thermal versus pressure versus chemical models), which may have differences in the way they are regulated; and (3) influences due to effects on temperature, blood flow or motor function. With this potential for variability, it is perhaps not surprising that there is some variability in the results of studies reporting on the effects of various 5-HT agonists and antagonists on nociceptive transmission within the spinal cord [62]. For instance, different 5-HT3 receptor densities could exist in various neuronal systems, one density type being completely inhibited at low concentrations, and the others only at higher concentrations of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, thus resulting in contrary effects. Finally, the \"endogeneous 5-HT tone\" may greatly influence agonist and antagonist action. Considering this complexity of serotonin-mediated reactions, it is not surprising that treatment of pain by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appears to yield inconsistent results. As fibromyalgia is now regarded as a pain amplification syndrome with a broad variety of additional nonpain symptoms, the interrelations are complicated even more. Fibromyalgia associated symptoms (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, and irritable bowel syndrome) can be modulated by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. From the data evaluated so far, there is evidence that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists provide significant benefit in some fibromyalgia patients. In our practice, the data justify a careful application in clinical use according to the study results. The dosage, route of application, long term adverse reactions and duration of therapy still need to be studied in greater detail. Recently reported adverse events from therapy of irritable bowel syndrome with alosetron [63-67] provide a note for caution before hastily using 5-HT3 receptor antagonists without more studies. One can surmise that, much as the biochemistry of depression has been elucidated by the development of the SSRIs, a greater understanding of the role of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in treating fibromyalgia patients may provide some insights into disease mechanisms of this enigmatic disorder.",

The past several years have seen the rapid evolution of a new and comprehensive model of IBS based on alterations in brain-gut interactions. Alterations in the bidirectional communication between the enteric nervous system and the central nervous system are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin), a major neurotransmitter in the gastrointestinal tract, and its receptors 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 are involved in the control of gastrointestinal function. A number of abnormal motor and sensory patterns have been reported in patients with IBS. However, it is not known whether these abnormalities are related to symptoms or have a role in establishing a diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Visceral hyperalgesia in IBS patients can be secondary to altered receptor sensitivity at the viscus itself and altered central modulation of sensation involving psychological influences in the interpretation of these sensations. The development of diagnostic criteria for IBS helps to avoid unnecessary and costly investigations. A detailed history allows us to diagnose IBS and search for another cause if warning symptoms are present. The Rome criteria are presently used to define IBS and are currently the most widely applied criteria used in clinical diagnosis and research purposes. Abdominal pain or discomfort associated with chronic altered bowel habits are the mainstay in diagnosis, while the supportive criteria may be used to further classify IBS patients into diarrhea-predominant or constipation-predominant subgroups. Minimal diagnostic tests have been advocated in the initial diagnostic approach to patients with suspected IBS, depending on the predominant symptom. The therapeutic goals in IBS must focus on the overall well-being of the patient, including abdominal symptoms and the accompanying nonbowel symptoms and affective disorders. It is important to establish an effective physician-patient relationship and to reassure the patient once the diagnosis of IBS is made. Dietary modification may be of value in some patients with IBS. Dietary fiber is frequently recommended for patients with constipation-predominant IBS. Two novel serotonin agonists are currently under development for constipated IBS patients, tegaserod and prucalopride. Antidiarrheal agents, including loperamide and diphenoxylate, may help patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may play a role in the management of such patients in the future. Psychological treatment and antidepressants should be considered when IBS symptoms are severe or refractory or associated with psychological distress and impaired quality of life.",

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as \"bad cholesterol\"), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.  Pitavastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD. Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality. Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack. Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.  While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. Study data has confirmed that pitavastatin\\'s potency in lowering LDL-C is comparable to that of other statins but also has increased efficacy in increasing HDL-C (also known as \"good cholesterol\"). Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.']",

They are responsinle for different color, flavor and smell of plants. They form part of a plant's natural defense mechanism against diseases. Their therapeutic values to human health have been reported in the different system of medicine [1] . Natural products such as pure phytoconstituents and plant extracts offer limitless opportunities for new drug development due to the unmatched availability of chemical diversity. Plants play an important role in the medicinal preparations, both preventive and curative. In the world, China and India are the leading countries in using medicinal plants and their traditions of plant remedies date back to at least 7000 years. According to WHO 80% of the World's population relies on traditional medicine to meet their daily health requirement. Today the vast traditional knowledge of medicinal plants is playing an important role in the development of new drugs. Some of the important drugs which were developed from plants source are aspirin from filipendula ulmar, morphine from papaver sominiferum and ephedrin from ephedra [2] . A large number of phyto drugs prescribed worldwide are derived directly or indirectly from natural sources.

Brucine poisoning is rare, since it is usually ingested with strychnine, and strychnine is more toxic than brucine. In synthetic chemistry, it can be used as a tool for stereospecific chemical syntheses. Brucine is named from the genus Brucea, named after James Bruce who brought back Brucea antidysenterica from Ethiopia. History Brucine was discovered in 1819 by Pelletier and Caventou in the bark of the Strychnos nux-vomica tree. While its structure was not deduced until much later, it was determined that it was closely related to strychnine in 1884, when the chemist Hanssen converted both strychnine and brucine into the same molecule. Identification Brucine can be detected and quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Historically, brucine was distinguished from strychnine by its reactivity toward chromic acid.

Methods: To profile the phyconstituents of Strychnos nux-vomica, in the present study hydroalcoholic extract of Strychnos nux-vomica was subjected to preliminary phytochemical analysis, antimicrobial activities against certain pathogenic microorganisms, solubility test, loss on drying and pH value. Extract was also subjected to the quantitative analysis including total phenol, flavonoid and heavy metal analysis. Quantitative analysis was performed through HPTLC methods using strychnine and brucine as a standard marker. Results: Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloid, carbohydrate, tannin, steroid, triterpenoid and glycoside in the extract. Total flavonoid and phenol content of Strychnos nux-vomica L extract was found to be 0.40 % and 0.43%. Result showed that the level of heavy metal (lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium) complie the standard level. Total bacterial count, yeast and moulds contents were found to be under the limit whereas E. coli and salmonella was found to be absent in the extract. Content of strychnine and brucine were found to be 4.75% and 3.91%. Conclusions: These studies provide valluable information for correct identification and selection of the drug from various adulterations.

Therefore, it is quite imperative to explore impending remedies for rapid and accurate functional retrieval following such conditions. Natural product-based intervention can prove effective to facilitate the process of functions regain. Here, we investigated the effect of processed Strychnos nux-vomica seeds at a dose of 250\u2009mg/kg body weight in a mouse model of induced Sciatic nerve lesion in promoting the recovery of the functions. A compression injury was induced in the Sciatic nerve of the right leg in the mice. Sensory function recovery was evaluated by hot-plate and formalin tests, whereas the motor function retrieval was assessed by measuring muscle grip strength, sciatic functional index, and muscle mass restoration. Oxidative stress and blood cell count were measured by biochemistry and haematological analyses. This study indicates that Strychnos nux-vomica seeds enhance the rate of recovery of both sensory and motor functions. It helps restore the muscle mass, attenuates total oxidant status and enhances the total anti-oxidant capacity of the biological system. Moreover, the treated animals manifested an enhanced glucose tolerance aptitude and augmented granulocyte and platelet counts. Improved oxidant control, enhanced glucose sensitivity and amended granulocyte and platelet counts are likely to contribute to the advantageous effects of Strychnos nux-vomica, and warrant further in-depth studies for deciphering possible mechanisms and identification of active constituent(s) responsible for these effects. Strychnos nux-vomica seed offers functional recovery promoting effects following a mechanical injury to the Sciatic nerve and the possible reasons behind this effect can be reduced oxidative stress and improved glycaemic control. Further and detailed investigations can unravel this mystery.",

The alkaloid profiles of the herb drugs were obtained without the need of complicated sample preparation to avoid potential damage or change of the active components. Seed tissues that were optimally sliced to a thickness of 10-20 microm from the crude and processed Strychnos nux-vomica seeds as well as various parts of tissue such as endosperm and epidermis were analyzed on MALDI target plate after the matrix was directly applied onto the tissue surface. The obtained alkaloid profiles provided valuable information for the differentiation of crude and processed Strychnos nux-vomica seeds and for the explanation of the significantly different toxicity. Experimental results indicated that the direct MALDI-TOFMS analysis allowed rapid screening of the alkaloid components in Strychnos nux-vomica seeds.",

Cancer therapies utilize DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapies and ionizing radiation to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest. Tumor cells with increased levels of Chk1 acquire survival advantages due to the ability to tolerate a higher level of DNA damage. Therefore, Chk1 may contribute to chemotherapy resistance. In order to optimize chemotherapies, Chk1 must be inhibited to reduce the survival advantage. Chk1 gene can be effectively silenced by siRNA knockdown for further analysis based on an independent validation. By inhibiting Chk1, cancer cells lose the ability to repair damaged DNA which allows chemotherapeutic agents to work more effectively. Combining DNA damaging therapies such as chemotherapy or radiation treatment with Chk1 inhibition enhances targeted cell death and provides",

This may result in a suppression of Hh-mediated signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in which this pathway is aberrantly activated.  Smo is a G-protein coupled receptor that lies just downstream of the Hh cell surface receptor Patched-1 in the Hh pathway; in the absence of ligand, Patched-1 (Ptch1) inhibits Smo, and ligand binding to Ptch1 results in increased levels of Smo. The Hh-mediated signaling pathways play an important role in cellular growth and differentiation, and tissue repair; constitutive activation of this pathway is associated with uncontrolled cellular proliferation in a variety of cancers.']",

Taxonomy This soft coral was first described in 1766 by the Russian naturalist Peter Simon Pallas who named it Parerythropodium coralloides. It was later determined on the basis of its growth forms, the nature of its spicules (small skeletal elements) and the passages in its coenenchyme (the tissue uniting the polyps) that it should be included in the genus Alcyonium and it was renamed Alcyonium coralloides.",

                    "contents": "Name: Cholesterol\nDescription: ['Cholesterol is a sterol (a combination steroid and alcohol) and a lipid found in the cell membranes of all body tissues, and transported in the blood plasma of all animals. The name originates from the Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid), and the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, as researchers first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1784. In the body, cholesterol can exist in either the free form or as an ester with a single fatty acid (of 10-20 carbons in length) covalently attached to the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the cholesterol ring.  Because of the mechanism of synthesis plasma cholesterol esters tend to contain relatively high proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Most of the cholesterol consumed as a dietary lipid exists as cholesterol esters. Cholesterol esters have a lower solubility in water than cholesterol and are more hydrophobic. They are hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, cholesterol esterase, to produce cholesterol and free fatty acids.\\n \\nCholesterol has vital structural roles in membranes and in lipid metabolism in general. It is a biosynthetic precursor of bile acids, vitamin D and steroid hormones (glucocorticoids, estrogens, progesterones, androgens and aldosterone). In addition, it contributes to the development and working of the central nervous system, and it has major functions in signal transduction and sperm development. Cholesterol is a ubiquitous component of all animal tissues where much of it is located in the membranes, although it is not evenly distributed. The highest proportion of unesterified cholesterol is in the plasma membrane (roughly 30-50% of the lipid in the membrane or 60-80% of the cholesterol in the cell), while mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum have very low cholesterol contents. Cholesterol is also enriched in early and recycling endosomes, but not in late endosomes. The brain contains more cholesterol than any other organ, where it comprises roughly a quarter of the total free cholesterol in the human body. Of all the organic constituents of blood, only glucose is present in a higher molar concentration than cholesterol.\\n \\nCholesterol esters appear to be the preferred form for transport in plasma and as a biologically inert storage (de-toxification) form. They do not contribute to membranes but are packed into intracellular lipid particles. Cholesterol molecules (i.e. cholesterol esters) are transported throughout the body via lipoprotein particles. The largest lipoproteins, which primarily transport fats from the intestinal mucosa to the liver, are called chylomicrons. They carry mostly triglyceride fats and cholesterol (that are from food and especially internal cholesterol secreted by the liver into the bile). In the liver, chylomicron particles give up triglycerides and some cholesterol, and are converted into low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which carry triglycerides and cholesterol on to other body cells. In healthy individuals the LDL particles are large and relatively few in number. In contrast, large numbers of small LDL particles are strongly associated with promoting atheromatous disease within the arteries. (Lack of information on LDL particle number and size is one of the major problems of conventional lipid tests.). In conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially small LDL particles, cholesterol promotes atheroma plaque deposits in the walls of arteries, a condition known as atherosclerosis, which is a major contributor to coronary heart disease and other forms of cardiovascular disease. There is a world-wide trend to believe that lower total cholesterol levels tend to correlate with lower atherosclerosis event rates (though some studies refute this idea). As a result, cholesterol has become a very large focus for the scientific community trying to determine the proper amount of cholesterol needed in a healthy diet. However, the primary association of atherosclerosis with cholesterol has always been specifically with cholesterol transport patterns, not total cholesterol per se. For example, total cholesterol can be low, yet made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles and atheroma growth rates are high. In contrast, however, if LDL particle number is low (mostly large particles) and a large percentage of the HDL particles are large (HDL is actively reverse transporting cholesterol), then atheroma growth rates are usually low, even negative, for any given total cholesterol concentration. These effects are further complicated by the relative concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in the endothelium, since ADMA down-regulates production of nitric oxide, a relaxant of the endothelium. Thus, high levels of ADMA, associated with highly oxidized levels of LDL, pose a heightened risk factor for vascular disease.']",
