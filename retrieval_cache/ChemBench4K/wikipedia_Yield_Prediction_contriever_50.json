Ethylene and ethane that are proposed products have C-H bonds of similar strength. Thus, any catalyst that can activate methane can also activate the products. The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process. Nevertheless, some recent work have shown that the mechanism of the OCM could be initiated by an heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond",

For structure calculations, it is generally desirable to choose the smallest number of ions that can represent the structure. For example, NaCl is a bcc cubic structure. At a first guess, one might construct a cell of two interlocked cubes – 8 Na and 8 Cl – as one's unit cell. This will give the correct answer but is computationally wasteful.

Donors are defined as nitrogen or oxygen atoms that have at least one directly bonded hydrogen atom: [N,n,O;!H0] or [#7,#8;!H0] (aromatic oxygen cannot have a bonded hydrogen) Acceptors are defined as nitrogen or oxygen: [N,n,O,o] or [#7,#8] A simple definition of aliphatic amines that are likely to protonate at physiological pH can be written as the following recursive SMARTS:",

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: (C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

The understanding of how orbitals interact in the course of a pericyclic process has led to the Woodward–Hoffmann rules, a simple set of criteria to predict whether a pericyclic mechanism for a reaction is likely or favorable. For instance, these rules predict that the [4+2] cycloaddition of butadiene and ethylene under thermal conditions is likely a pericyclic process, while the [2+2] cycloaddition of two ethylene molecules is not. These are consistent with experimental data, supporting an ordered, concerted transition state for the former and a multistep radical process for the latter. Several equivalent approaches, outlined below, lead to the same predictions.",

As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C. Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with @@ and @, respectively (because the @ symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).",

Labinger's argument, later demonstrated experimentally by Mazanec et al., is based on the mechanism of methane activation, which is a radical mechanism, forming H and CH3 radicals by the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond. Ethylene and ethane that are proposed products have C-H bonds of similar strength. Thus, any catalyst that can activate methane can also activate the products. The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process. Nevertheless, some recent work have shown that the mechanism of the OCM could be initiated by an heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond",

However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

One of its SMILES forms is NC(C)C(=O)O, more fully written as N[CH](C)C(=O)O. L-Alanine, the more common enantiomer, is written as N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction).

The chemical graph is first trimmed to remove hydrogen atoms and cycles are broken to turn it into a spanning tree. Where cycles have been broken, numeric suffix labels are included to indicate the connected nodes. Parentheses are used to indicate points of branching on the tree. The resultant SMILES form depends on the choices: of the bonds chosen to break cycles, of the starting atom used for the depth-first traversal, and of the order in which branches are listed when encountered.

These algorithms first convert the SMILES to an internal representation of the molecular structure; an algorithm then examines that structure and produces a unique SMILES string. Various algorithms for generating canonical SMILES have been developed and include those by Daylight Chemical Information Systems, OpenEye Scientific Software, MEDIT, Chemical Computing Group, MolSoft LLC, and the Chemistry Development Kit. A common application of canonical SMILES is indexing and ensuring uniqueness of molecules in a database.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Thus, benzene, pyridine and furan can be represented respectively by the SMILES c1ccccc1, n1ccccc1 and o1cccc1. Aromatic nitrogen bonded to hydrogen, as found in pyrrole must be represented as [nH]; thus imidazole is written in SMILES notation as n1c[nH]cc1.",

For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written C/C=C/C=C/C. As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C.

Exothermic proton transfer reactions with H3O+ are assumed to proceed at the collisional rate (see Collision theory), the coefficient for which, kc, is calculable using the method described by Su and Chesnavich, providing the polarizability and dipole moment are known for the reactant molecule. NO+ and O2+ reactions proceed at kc less frequently, and thus the reaction rates of the reactant molecule with these precursor ions must often be derived experimentally by comparing the decline in the count rates of each of the NO+ and O2+ precursor ions to that of H3O+ as the sample flow of reactant molecules is increased. The product ions and rate coefficients have been derived in this way for well over 200 volatile compounds, which can be found in the scientific literature.",

Ethylene and ethane that are proposed products have C-H bonds of similar strength. Thus, any catalyst that can activate methane can also activate the products. The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process. Nevertheless, some recent work have shown that the mechanism of the OCM could be initiated by an heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond",

Donors are defined as nitrogen or oxygen atoms that have at least one directly bonded hydrogen atom: [N,n,O;!H0] or [#7,#8;!H0] (aromatic oxygen cannot have a bonded hydrogen) Acceptors are defined as nitrogen or oxygen: [N,n,O,o] or [#7,#8] A simple definition of aliphatic amines that are likely to protonate at physiological pH can be written as the following recursive SMARTS:",

Preparation, structure, handling CSI is prepared by treating cyanogen chloride with sulfur trioxide, the product being distilled directly from the reaction mixture. SO3 + ClCN → ClSO2NCO In this transformation, both the carbon and the nitrogen termini of CN are functionalized. The structure of CSI is represented as ClS(O)2-N=C=O. It consists of two electron-withdrawing components, the chlorosulfonyl group (SO2Cl) and the isocyanate group (-N=C=O). Because of its resulting electrophilicity, the use of CSI in chemical synthesis requires relatively inert solvents such as chlorocarbons, acetonitrile, and ethers.

Labinger's argument, later demonstrated experimentally by Mazanec et al., is based on the mechanism of methane activation, which is a radical mechanism, forming H and CH3 radicals by the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond. Ethylene and ethane that are proposed products have C-H bonds of similar strength. Thus, any catalyst that can activate methane can also activate the products. The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process. Nevertheless, some recent work have shown that the mechanism of the OCM could be initiated by an heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond",

The combustion of methane (CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O) is equivalent to the sum of the hypothetical decomposition into elements followed by the combustion of the elements to form carbon dioxide and water: CH4 → C + 2 H2 C + O2 → CO2 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O Applying Hess's law, ΔcombH⦵(CH4) = [ΔfH⦵(CO2) + 2 ΔfH⦵(H2O)] − ΔfH⦵(CH4).

Mechanism and stereochemistry Prevailing mechanism The primary debate concerning the mechanism of the rearrangement centers on whether it is a concerted (sigmatropic) or stepwise (diradical) process. Mechanistic experiments have shown that trans-divinylcyclopropanes epimerize to the corresponding cis isomers and undergo the rearrangement via what is most likely a concerted pathway. A boat-like transition state has been proposed and helps explain the observed stereospecificity of the process.

First, for our ideal chain, a microscopic state is characterized by the superposition of the states of each individual monomer (with i varying from 1 to N). In its solvent, the ideal chain is constantly subject to shocks from moving solvent molecules, and each of these shocks sends the system from its current microscopic state to another, very similar microscopic state. For an ideal polymer, as will be shown below, there are more microscopic states compatible with a short end-to-end distance than there are microscopic states compatible with a large end-to-end distance. Thus, for an ideal chain, maximizing its entropy means reducing the distance between its two free ends. Consequently, a force that tends to collapse the chain is exerted by the ideal chain between its two free ends. In this section, the mean of this force will be derived. The generality of the expression obtained at the thermodynamic limit will then be discussed.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds.

One of its SMILES forms is NC(C)C(=O)O, more fully written as N[CH](C)C(=O)O. L-Alanine, the more common enantiomer, is written as N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

By choosing appropriate coordinates, one might simulate it with just two atoms: 1 Na and 1 Cl.",

One of its SMILES forms is NC(C)C(=O)O, more fully written as N[CH](C)C(=O)O. L-Alanine, the more common enantiomer, is written as N[C@@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

Example for two reactants Consider the combustion of benzene, represented by the following chemical equation: 2 C6H6(l) + 15 O2(g) -> 12 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l) This means that 15 moles of molecular oxygen (O2) is required to react with 2 moles of benzene (C6H6) The amount of oxygen required for other quantities of benzene can be calculated using cross-multiplication (the rule of three). For example, if 1.5 mol C6H6 is present, 11.25 mol O2 is required:",

In conjunction with simulated powder packing models, PXRD can determine COF crystal structure.",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds.

Rather than a specialist's chemical detail, this is a profound conclusion for astrophysics because it partly explains the large amounts of dust created by supernovae in the early universe. Meteoritic chemists to whom his 1998-99 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference papers were addressed doubted that possibility on intuitive but erroneous chemical grounds, believing that abundant hot oxygen gas would oxidize all carbon atoms leaving them trapped within chemically inert CO molecules—an expectation that holds true in ordinary stars.

Where cycles have been broken, numeric suffix labels are included to indicate the connected nodes. Parentheses are used to indicate points of branching on the tree. The resultant SMILES form depends on the choices: of the bonds chosen to break cycles, of the starting atom used for the depth-first traversal, and of the order in which branches are listed when encountered.

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: (C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

The group C*-algebra C*(G) Let C[G] be the group ring of a discrete group G. For a locally compact group G, the group C*-algebra C*(G) of G is defined to be the C*-enveloping algebra of L1(G), i.e. the completion of Cc(G) with respect to the largest C*-norm:",

The converse is also true; the standard enthalpy of reaction is positive for an endothermic reaction.

Configuration at tetrahedral carbon is specified by @ or @@. Consider the four bonds in the order in which they appear, left to right, in the SMILES form. Looking toward the central carbon from the perspective of the first bond, the other three are either clockwise or counter-clockwise. These cases are indicated with @@ and @, respectively (because the @ symbol itself is a counter-clockwise spiral).",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2.

Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process.

For example, F/C=C/F (see depiction) is one representation of trans-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorine atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond (as shown in the figure), whereas F/C=C\\F (see depiction) is one possible representation of cis-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorines are on the same side of the double bond.",

Each individual atom is accounted for, where CB−(H) accounts for one benzene carbon bound to a hydrogen atom. This would be multiplied by five, since there are five CB−(H) atoms. The CB−(C) molecule further accounts for the other benzene carbon attached to the butyl group. The C−(CB)(C)(H)2 accounts for the carbon linked to the benzene group on the butyl moiety. The 2' carbon of the butyl group would be C−(C)3(H) because it is a tertiary carbon (connecting to three other carbon atoms). The final calculation comes from the CH3 groups connected to the 2' carbon;",

A qualitative molecular orbital diagram predicts that the HOMO would have silicon(3s)-cyclopentadienyl antibonding character and the LUMO would have silicon(3p)-cyclopentadienyl antibonding character. NBO calculations are consistent with the predictions from a qualitative molecular orbital diagram, showing antibonding character between the silicon and the cyclopentadienyl ligands in both the HOMO and the LUMO.

When pi bonding contributes to the measured enthalpy, the enthalpy calculated from the E and C parameters will be less than the measured enthalpy and the difference provides a measure of the extent of the pi bonding contribution. The ᐃH calculated for the reaction of Me3B with Me3N is larger than the observed. This discrepancy is attributed to steric repulsion between the methyl groups on the B and N. The difference between the calculated and observed values can then be taken as the amount of the steric effect, a value otherwise not attainable. Steric effects have also been identified with (CH3)3SnCl and with Cu(HFacac)2.",

Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

Stoichiometry is used to run calculations about chemical reactions, for example, the stoichiometric mole ratio between reactants and products. The stoichiometry of a chemical reaction is based on chemical formulas and equations that provide the quantitative relation between the number of moles of various products and reactants, including yields. Stoichiometric equations are used to determine the limiting reagent or reactant—the reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction. The limiting reagent determines the theoretical yield—the relative quantity of moles of reactants and the product formed in a chemical reaction. Other reactants are said to be present in excess.

Therefore, if the concentration of A at some arbitrary stage of the reaction is [A], then it will have fallen to [A] after a further interval of (ln 2)/k. Hence, the half-life of a first order reaction is given as the following: The half-life of a first order reaction is independent of its initial concentration and depends solely on the reaction rate constant, k. Second order kinetics: In the second order reactions, the concentration of the reactant decrease following this formula: Then, we replace [A] for [A]0 in order to calculate the half-life of the reactant A and isolate the time of the half-life (t1/2): As you can see, the half-life of the second order reactions depends on the initial concentration and rate constant.",

The Daylight and OpenEye algorithms for generating canonical SMILES differ in their treatment of aromaticity. Branching Branches are described with parentheses, as in CCC(=O)O for propionic acid and FC(F)F for fluoroform. The first atom within the parentheses, and the first atom after the parenthesized group, are both bonded to the same branch point atom. The bond symbol must appear inside the parentheses; outside (E.g.: CCC=(O)O) is invalid.",

In the prebiotic atmosphere, O2 was produced by the photolysis of CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere: CO_2 + h\\nu -> CO + O H_2O + h\\nu -> 1/2O_2 + 2H These reactions aren't necessarily a net source of O2. If the CO and O produced from CO2 photolysis remain in the atmosphere, then they will eventually recombine to make CO2. Likewise, if the H and O2 from H2O photolysis remain in the atmosphere, then they will eventually react to form H2O. The photolysis of H2O is a net source of O2 only if the hydrogen escapes to space.",

The chemical graph is first trimmed to remove hydrogen atoms and cycles are broken to turn it into a spanning tree. Where cycles have been broken, numeric suffix labels are included to indicate the connected nodes. Parentheses are used to indicate points of branching on the tree. The resultant SMILES form depends on the choices: of the bonds chosen to break cycles, of the starting atom used for the depth-first traversal, and of the order in which branches are listed when encountered.

The rate of these collisions is however masked by the fact that the rate determining step remains the unimolecular breakdown of the energized reactant. The half-life is independent of the starting concentration and is given by . Examples of such reactions are: 2N2O5 -> 4NO2 + O2 [CoCl(NH3)5]^2+ + H2O -> [Co(H2O)(NH3)5]^3+ + Cl- H2O2 -> H2O + 1/2O2",

This reaction can be noted in three ways, as follows: Standard notation: Ca3SiO5 + H2O -> (CaO) * (SiO2) * (H2O) + Ca(OH)2 Balanced: 2Ca3SiO5 + 7H2O -> 3CaO * 2SiO2 * 4H2O + 3Ca(OH)2 Cement chemist notation (the hyphenation denotes the variable stoichiometry): C3S + H → C-S-H + CH The underlying hydration reaction forms two products:",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",
