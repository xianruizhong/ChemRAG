Therefore okadaic acid causes increases in phosphorylation of proteins that affect a diverse array of cellular processes. For instance, this toxin modulates metabolic parameters in intact cells. In this sense it stimulates lipolysis, and inhibits fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes however increases glucose output and gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Additionally, okadaic acid reaches cytotoxic concentrations in the intestinal tissues in accordance with the diarrhea.

Disabling the calmodulin kinase II that is thought to respond to the mitotic Cai signal using a peptide inhibitor fails to prevent mitosis in response to okadaic acid.

Purified allergens can be used individually or incorporated into multiple allergen standards. Multicenter international collaborative studies are required to validate candidate allergen standards and immunoassays, as a prelude to being approved by regulatory agencies. Mass spectrometry is a sophisticated and powerful proteomics tool that is being developed for allergen analysis. Recent results using pollen allergens show that mass spectrometry can identify and measure specific allergens in a complex mixture and can provide precise information of the variability of natural allergen extracts. In future, the combined use of immunoassays and mass spectrometry will provide complete standardization of allergenic products. Molecular standardization will form the basis of new allergy diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as assessment of environmental exposure, and will improve the quality of treatment options for allergic patients.",

Mometasone furoate degradation leads to the formation of two products, D1 and D2 with significant pH dependence. The half-lives for the conversion of MF to D1 and subsequent conversion of D1 to D2 at 37 degrees C in SLF were 1.3 and 4.8 h respectively. LC-MS and NMR analysis confirmed that D1 is 9,11-epoxide mometasone furoate while D2 represents a new chemical structure that shows cyclization within the C17-C21 region. The biological activity of these degradation products was assessed in rat lung glucocorticoid receptor binding studies. D1 showed 4 fold greater receptor affinity to glucocorticoid receptors compared to dexamethasone. However, the receptor affinity for D2 was a log order lower than that for dexamethasone. The instability of MF in SLF resulted in two degradation products, one of the degradation products showing glucocorticoid receptor activity, the other representing a new cyclized structure whose pharmacological properties have not been described.

It is characterised by low systemic availability due to its high lipophilicity, low percutaneous absorption and rapid hepatic biotransformation, and consequently has no significant effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

A review of its intranasal use in allergic rhinitis.\nMometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid which has been evaluated for intranasal use in the treatment of adults and children with allergic rhinitis. In several large, well-controlled clinical trials, mometasone furoate 200 micrograms administered once daily as an aqueous intranasal spray was significantly more effective than placebo in controlling the symptoms associated with moderate to severe seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate or once-daily fluticasone propionate in the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis, and was as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate and slightly more effective than once-daily oral loratadine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was also as effective as twice-daily beclomethasone dipropionate or once-daily budesonide, and significantly more effective than placebo in the prophylaxis of seasonal allergic rhinitis. The onset of action of mometasone furoate was approximately 7 hours in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Mometasone furoate was as well tolerated as beclomethasone dipropionate, fluticasone propionate and budesonide in clinical trials, with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to placebo. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate and of limited duration. The most common adverse events associated with mometasone furoate therapy were nasal irritation and/or burning, headache, epistaxis and pharyngitis. Intranasal or oral mometasone furoate had no detectable effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in studies of &lt; or = 1 year in duration. Mometasone furoate is a well tolerated intranasal corticosteroid with minimal systemic activity and an onset of action of &lt; or = 7 hours. It is effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis and the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis in patients with moderate to severe symptoms.",

Two validation studies demonstrated that the protocol can reproduce crystal structures of nuclear receptors, and is appropriate for modeling ligand binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Key hydrogen bonding interactions between mometasone furoate and the glucocorticoid receptor, as well as favorable hydrophobic interactions between the furoate group and the 17alpha pocket, contribute to high affinity and specificity of this ligand for the receptor. Using the glucocorticoid des-ciclesonide, which has an even larger moiety at the 16,17alpha position, induced-fit docking demonstrates the ability of the 17alpha pocket of the receptor to expand even further to accommodate the ligand.",

When the protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is created from N-terminus to C-terminus. The convention for writing peptide sequences is to put the C-terminal end on the right and write the sequence from N- to C-terminus. Chemistry Each amino acid has a carboxyl group and an amine group. Amino acids link to one another to form a chain by a dehydration reaction which joins the amine group of one amino acid to the carboxyl group of the next. Thus polypeptide chains have an end with an unbound carboxyl group, the C-terminus, and an end with an unbound amine group, the N-terminus. Proteins are naturally synthesized starting from the N-terminus and ending at the C-terminus. Function",

Hydrophilic residues at the hydrophobic positions in the coiled-coil structure play important roles in structures and functions of natural proteins. We reported here a peptide that formed a triple stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil showing the pH-dependent structural change. The peptide was designed to have two His residues at the hydrophobic positions of the center of the coiled-coil structure. The peptide folded into a triple stranded coiled-coil at neutral pH, while it unfolded at acidic pH. This construct is useful to create a protein that the structure or function is controlled by pH.",

Alosetron was shown to dose-dependently inhibit the 5-HT-induced skin flare response, increase colonic transit time and increase basal jejunal water and electrolyte absorption, in healthy volunteers. In irritable bowel syndrome patients, alosetron increased colonic compliance. Alosetron had no effect on the perception of gastric distension or on meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion. Orally alosetron has approximately 60% bioavailability and a half-life of 1.5 h. At doses of 1 mg or more, it has a pharmacodynamic duration of action which justifies twice a day dosing.

New findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptors exist on gut afferent neurones and that their activation by locally released 5-HT leads to visceral nociceptive stimulation, in addition to increased neuronally-mediated motor and secretory activity. If this concept is validated, it will provide a rationale for the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in patients with increased gut motility, reduced fluid absorption and low nociceptive thresholds leading to abdominal pain. Alosetron is a highly selective, potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which is well absorbed with a long pharmacodynamic half-life. Its ability to provide long-lasting blockade of 5-HT3 receptors throughout the body make it an ideal candidate within its class to evaluate the clinical hypothesis that sustained and ubiquitous 5-HT3 receptor blockade is of value in the treatment of IBS.",

Studies involving healthy volunteers and IBS patients have demonstrated a beneficial effect of treatment with alosetron on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and discomfort, altered bowel function as well as improvement of quality of life (QOL). Data from animals studies suggest the involvement of 5-HT(3) receptors on intrinsic primary afferent neurons in the mediation of the effect of alosetron on gastrointestinal motility and secretion. While definitive proof of a visceroanalgesic action is not available, an additional central mechanism of action is suggested by findings obtained in animal models, as well as from human brain imaging studies. Alosetron shows a greater effectiveness in women, and the role of genetic factors underlying inter-individual differences in the response to alosetron is currently under investigation. The most frequent adverse event associated with the use of alosetron is constipation and in some rare cases, the development of colonic mucosal ischaemia. In the following review, the most recent reported effects of alosetron on gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity and anxiety, both in terms of preclinical and clinical data will be discussed. The impact of alosetron on QOL in IBS patients and the safety of treatment with alosetron, will also be covered.",

During 12 weeks of treatment, alosetron was shown to elicit significant relief of abdominal pain and discomfort compared with placebo or mebeverine in female IBS patients with diarrhea. Alosetron slowed colonic transit and treatment efficacy was apparent after a week of treatment.

IBS is a common multisymptom disorder that is associated with a high socioeconomic burden. The goal of treatment is to provide rapid and sustained global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS with a single, effective, well-tolerated agent. Traditional treatment options target single symptoms, and many patients are dissatisfied with the level of relief achieved and adverse effects. Research has revealed that serotonin is involved in three major actions in the gut: (1) mediating intestinal motility, (2) mediating intestinal secretion in the GI tract, and (3) modulating perception in the bowels. Serotonin is also a vital link in the brain-gut axis. Alterations in key elements of serotonin signaling have been demonstrated in patients with IBS. Tegaserod, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT(4))-receptor partial agonist, is indicated for use in women with IBS whose primary bowel symptom is constipation. Alosetron, a 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist, is indicated for use in women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS in whom traditional therapies have failed. The clinical usefulness of several other serotonergic agents for IBS is being investigated. The use of serotonergic agents in patients with IBS is based on the critical role that serotonin plays in the maintenance of normal gut function and brain-gut communication.

The strategic locations of 5-HT and its receptors are described, the most dominant being the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 type. 5-HT, acting mostly at 5-HT3 or 5-HT3-like receptors, enhances the sensitivity of visceral neurones projecting between the gut and the central nervous systems. 5-HT, acting at 5-HT4 receptors promotes the sensitivity of enteric neurones that react to luminal stimuli. 5-HT4 and 5-HT3 receptors also mediate, respectively, sensitising and physiological actions of 5-HT on gastro-intestinal motor and secretory functions. This distribution implies that some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists might reduce certain symptoms of IBS, such as pain, by reducing the reactivity of the visceral afferent neurones linking the gut with the brain and spinal cord. However, such antagonists are not likely to find widespread clinical acceptance because they can also affect normal lower bowel function and promote constipation. 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, by contrast, reduce 5-HT-induced enteric nerve hypersensitivity without notably affecting the function of the normal bowel. Accordingly, these agents may reduce the symptoms of IBS directly, by reducing the incidence of defecation and diarrhoea and indirectly, by reducing both 'rebound' constipation and the post-prandial discomfort and pain associated with gastrointestinal hyper-reactivity.",

Some of these compounds showed high in vitro metabolical stability, and 6g showed marked antidiarrhetic activity with little side effect of constipation in in vivo tests. Our results indicate that 5-HT(3) receptor partial agonists might be superior as therapeutic agents to the drugs currently used for IBS treatment.",

Azasetron (Serotone) is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, and classified as benzamide derivative. It has a different chemical structure from indole-type 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as granisetron, ondansetron, ramosetron and tropisetron. The major difference is found in the pharmacokinetic profiles. Approximately 60-70% of azasetron administered i.v. and orally is excreted in urine as the unmetabolized form. Also, orally-administered azasetron has shown to be absorbed and/or secreted by the saturable transport mechanism in the small intestine, resulting in good bioavailability as approximately 90%. In this report, the relationship between the structure of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (especially azasetron) and their pharmacokinetics were described.",

Studies have shown that the drug can improve quality of life in men and women with diarrhea-predominant IBS. Cilansetron is the first 5-HT antagonist specifically designed for IBS that is effective in men as well as women. In 2005, Solvay received response from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that cilanserton is not approvable without additional clinical trials; further development has been discontinued.

Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is a serotonin receptor type 3 antagonist approved in early 2000 for use in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Initial use was widespread, but infrequent serious adverse events of ischemic colitis and severe constipation-related complications prompted alosetron's voluntary withdrawal from the US market in November 2000. Unprecedented public request prompted its reintroduction in 2002 under a Risk Management Plan, including a more restricted indication and a Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Despite these measures, the use of alosetron has been very limited since its reintroduction. Possible deterrents to its use include concerns over safety and the possible medical-legal implications raised by the Risk Management Plan. It is also possible that changes in the natural history and/or diagnosis of IBS-D have reduced the target population. Given the unique regulatory history of alosetron, these issues continue to engender controversy. This article profiles these concerns and reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety, and post-marketing experience with alosetron. Myths and misconceptions related to alosetron use, or lack thereof, are addressed to provide the reader with the evidence needed to make informed treatment decisions for their female patients with severe IBS-D.",

Their main function is to regulate DNA replication and DNA damage response. If a cell is exposed to exogenous damage to its DNA, CHK1/CHK2 stops the cell cycle to give time to the cellular mechanisms to repair DNA breakage and apoptosis too, if the damage is not repairable to activate programmed cell death. CHK1/CHK2 plays a crucial role in the repair of recombination-mediated double-stranded DNA breaks. The other important functions performed by these proteins are the beginning of DNA replication, the stabilization of replication forks, the resolution of replication stress and the coordination of mitosis, even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Prexasertib (LY2606368) is a small ATP-competitive selective inhibitor of CHK1 and CHK2. In preclinical studies, prexasertib in monotherapy has shown to induce DNA damage and tumor cells apoptosis. The preclinical data and early clinical studies advocate the use of prexasertib in solid tumors both in monotherapy and in combination with other drugs (antimetabolites, PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy). The safety and the efficacy of combination therapies with prexasertib need to be better evaluated in ongoing clinical trials.",

Here, we show that tumor cells exposed to DNA damage counteract cell death by releasing the antiapoptotic protein, survivin, from mitochondria. This is independent of p53, and requires activated checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), a putative tumor suppressor. Molecular or genetic targeting of Chk2 prevents the release of survivin from mitochondria, enhances DNA damage-induced tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibits the growth of resistant in vivo tumors. Therefore, activated Chk2 circumvents its own tumor-suppressive functions by promoting tumor cell survival. Inhibiting Chk2 in combination with DNA-damaging agents may provide a rational approach for treating resistant tumors.",

Accordingly, CHK1 has become a target of considerable interest in oncology. CHK1 inhibitors potentiate the efficacy of DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics by abrogating CHK1-mediated cell cycle arrest and preventing repair of damaged DNA. In addition, CHK1 inhibitors interfere with the biological role of CHK1 as a principal regulator of the cell cycle that controls the initiation of DNA replication, stabilizes replication forks, and coordinates mitosis. Since these functions of CHK1 facilitate progression through an unperturbed cell cycle, CHK1 inhibitors are being developed not only as chemopotentiators, but also as single-agent therapies. This review is intended to provide information on the current progress of CHK1 inhibitors in pre-clinical and clinical development and will focus on mechanisms of single-agent activity and potential strategies for patient tailoring and combinations with non-genotoxic agents.

Here we show that Chk1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively eliminates Chk1 protein expression without altering the cell cycle profile or inducing apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines under normal conditions. In the presence of DNA-damaging agents, however, Chk1 siRNA alone is sufficient to abrogate the DNA damage-induced G(2) checkpoint and significantly enhance apoptosis. Cell cycle kinetic profiles show that abrogation of G(2) arrest is mediated through shortening of the checkpoint. We also demonstrate that Chk1 siRNA enhances DNA damage-induced apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cell lines and augments the growth inhibition conferred by DNA-damaging agents. These findings imply that Chk1 inhibitors will have low cytotoxicity on their own and can enhance the efficacy of DNA-damaging drugs.",

Furthermore, Chk1 inhibitors prexasertib and AZD7762 enhanced cisplatin antitumor activity and overcame cisplatin resistance in SCLC preclinical models in\u00a0vitro an in\u00a0vivo. We also observed that higher expression of Chk1 was associated with poorer overall survival of patients with SCLC.

Cell cycle checkpoints are involved in the response to DNA damage and specifically prevent cell cycle progression to allow DNA repair. Tumor cells can take advantage of the G2 checkpoint to arrest following DNA damage and avoid immediate cell death. This can contribute to acquisition of drug resistance. By abrogating the G2 checkpoint arrest, it may be possible to synergistically augment tumor cell death induced by DNA damage and circumvent resistance. This requires an understanding of the molecules involved in regulating the checkpoints. Human Chk1 is a recently identified homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe checkpoint kinase gene, which is required for G2 arrest in response to DNA damage. Chk1 phosphorylates the dual specificity phosphatase cdc25C on Ser-216, and this may be involved in preventing cdc25 from activating cdc2/cyclinB and initiating mitosis. To further study the role of Chk1 in G2 checkpoint control, we identified a potent and selective indolocarbazole inhibitor (SB-218078) of Chk1 kinase activity and used this compound to assess cell cycle checkpoint responses. Limited DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation or the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan was used to induce G2 arrest in HeLa cells. In the presence of the Chk1 inhibitor, the cells did not arrest following gamma-irradiation or treatment with topotecan, but continued into mitosis. Abrogation of the damage-arrest checkpoint also enhanced the cytotoxicity of topoisomerase I inhibitors. These studies suggest that Chk1 activity is required for G2 arrest following DNA damage.",

Many cancer cells lack p53 activity and, therefore, depend on alternative checkpoint activators to arrest the cell cycle following DNA damage. Inhibition of these pathways is expected to specifically sensitize these p53-deficient cells to DNA damage caused by chemotherapy. Using isogenic p53-proficient and p53-deficient cancer cell lines, we show that inactivation of CHK1, but not MK2, abrogates cell cycle arrest following chemotherapy, specifically in p53-deficient cells. However, we show that CHK1 is required to maintain genome integrity and cell viability, and that p53-proficient cells are no less sensitive than p53-deficient cells to CHK1 inhibition in the presence of DNA damage. Thus, combining CHK1 inhibition with DNA damage does not lead to preferential killing of p53-deficient over p53-proficient cells, and inhibiting CHK1 does not appear to be a promising approach for potentiation of cancer chemotherapy.",

However, as inhibition of Chk1 affects normal replication and induces DNA damage, these agents also have the potential to induce genomic instability and contribute to tumorigenesis. To overcome this problem, we have developed a bioreductive prodrug, which functions as a Chk1/Aurora A inhibitor specifically in hypoxic conditions. To achieve this activity, a key functionality on the Chk1 inhibitor (CH-01) is masked by a bioreductive group, rendering the compound inactive as a Chk1/Aurora A inhibitor. Reduction of the bioreductive group nitro moiety, under hypoxic conditions, reveals an electron-donating substituent that leads to fragmentation of the molecule, affording the active inhibitor. Most importantly, we show a significant loss of viability in cancer cell lines exposed to hypoxia in the presence of CH-01.

However, increased expression of genes related to immunosuppression emerged over time suggesting evasion of immune surveillances. These findings in gene expression analyses were confirmed using mIHC which showed differential modulation of TIME in the tumor margins and as well as cores over time.

Many tumors are defective in the tumor suppressor p53 and therefore lack a functional G(1) checkpoint. In these tumors, however, the S-G(2) checkpoints remain intact and, in response to DNA damage, arrest cell cycle progression allowing time for DNA repair. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a key element in the DNA damage response pathway and plays a crucial role in the S-G(2)-phase checkpoints. Inhibiting Chk1 represents a therapeutic strategy for creating a \"synthetic lethal\" response by overriding the last checkpoint defense of tumor cells against the lethal damage induced by DNA-directed chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1 inhibition is consistent with emerging targeted therapies aiming to exploit molecular differences between normal and cancer cells. Adding a Chk1 inhibitor to DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy selectively targets tumors with intrinsic checkpoint defects while minimizing toxicity in checkpoint-competent normal cells. PF-00477736 was identified as a potent, selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor that inhibits Chk1 with a K(i) of 0.49 nM.

Studies to date have revealed striking similarities among Chk1 pathways of different organisms. In this review we discuss what is known about Chk1 activation and what downstream factors are regulated by Chk1 to counter replication blocks and DNA damage induced by UV, IR, and other genotoxic agents. Where applicable, we also compare the role of Chk1 with that of the Chk2 protein kinase in the checkpoint responses.",
