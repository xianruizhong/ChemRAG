The American subsidiary was established two years later and continued to publish it. During World War I the US government seized Merck's US operations and made it a separate American \"Merck\" company that continued to publish the Merck Index.

The idea was to download the single from iTunes, burn it to a CD-R, place the CD-shaped sticker onto the burnt CD and keep it in the wallet. \"Island Jam\" was initially available via Gilmour's website before being made more widely available.",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

Here α (ortho), β (meta), and γ (para) refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The systematic name for the pyridine derivatives is pyridinyl, wherein the position of the substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, the historical name pyridyl is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the systematic name. The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an electrophile to the nitrogen atom is called",

They are always printed as full capitals (not in lowercase or small capitals), but do not constitute the first letter of the name for English capitalization rules (as in the example above). Another example: The CIP rules assign a higher priority to bromine than to chlorine, and a higher priority to chlorine than to hydrogen, hence the following (possibly counterintuitive) nomenclature. For organic molecules with multiple double bonds, it is sometimes necessary to indicate the alkene location for each E or Z symbol. For example, the chemical name of alitretinoin is (2E,4E,6Z,8E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexenyl)nona-2,4,6,8-tetraenoic acid, indicating that the alkenes starting at positions 2, 4, and 8 are E while the one starting at position 6 is Z.

The American subsidiary was established two years later and continued to publish it. During World War I the US government seized Merck's US operations and made it a separate American \"Merck\" company that continued to publish the Merck Index. In 2012 the Merck Index was licensed to the Royal Society of Chemistry. An online version of The Merck Index, including historic records and new updates not in the print edition, is commonly available through research libraries. It also includes an appendix with monographs on organic named reactions. The 15th edition was published in April 2013.",

Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome.

In addition, given that many American books had already used rutherfordium and hahnium for 104 and 105, the ACS objected to those names being used for other elements.",

It has three chiral centres very close together, which combine to produce an amino acetal arrangement. Its empirical formula is C23H21F7N4O3. Aprepitant is an off-white crystalline solid that has a molecular weight of around 534.53. It has a very limited solubility in water. It does have a reasonably high solubility in non-polar molecules such as oils. This would, therefore, suggest that aprepitant as a whole, despite having components that are polar, is a non-polar substance. Synthesis",

My wife suffered most excruciating agony in her face, forehead and eyes through Tic or Rheumatism, which gave her no rest. After trying all kinds of remedies which failed, she was induced by a friend, who had had one of your bottles and which had cured two members of her family, to purchase one of your bottles as a trial, which she did, and after taking four doses she felt herself completely cured of pain. I am perfectly satisfied that the Medicine deserves universal praise, and I shall recommend it to all who may be so affected.\"",

Upright italics Since italic styles clearly look different from regular (roman) styles, it is possible to have 'upright italic' designs that have a cursive style but remain upright. In Latin-script countries, upright italics are rare but are sometimes used in mathematics or in complex texts where a section of text already in italics needs a 'double italic' style to add emphasis to it. Donald Knuth's Computer Modern has an alternate upright italic as an alternative to its standard italic, since its intended use is mathematical typesetting.",

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

While both explanations are probably valid to some extent, it is remarkable that the first \"modern\" system of chemical nomenclature appeared at the same time as the distinction (by Lavoisier) between elements and compounds, in the late eighteenth century.",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Beginning with Ferguson's 1958 paper in the Journal of Chemical Education, he developed a large body of knowledge around taste as it relates to the structure of organic compounds. This research eventually led to several papers on the structure-taste relationship of sweetness which put forth that compounds must have both a hydrogen bond donor and a large hydrophobic core for sweetness to be detected biochemically. In the arena of chemosensing, Ferguson also published on carcinogens and chemotherapy, helping to summarize many of the mechanisms for chemical carcinogenesis and methods for determining structure-function relationships in anticancer agents.",

Upon treatment with stoichiometric amounts of zinc halide, an organozinc compound similar to the carbenoid discussed above is produced. This can react with almost all alkenes and alkynes, including styrenes and alcohols. This is especially useful, as the unmodified Simmons-Smith is known to deprotonate alcohols. Unfortunately, as in Pathway B shown the intermediate can also react with the starting diazo compound, giving cis- or trans- 1,2-diphenylethene. Additionally, the intermediate can react with alcohols to produce iodophenylmethane, which can further undergo an SN2 reaction to produce ROCHPh, as in Pathway C. Non-Zinc Reagents.",

She matriculated at the University College of North Wales in 1897 and graduated with a B.Sc (London) in 1901 before taking up work as a demonstrator there. Smith was awarded an 1851 exhibition scholarship and chose to use it to conduct research at Owens College, Manchester from 1901 to 1903. Whilst at Owens College, she worked with both William Henry Perkin Jr. and K. J. P. Orton. Smith's research with Perkins resulted in four important research papers being published on structure determinations and new synthetic routes in organic chemistry between 1902 and 1904.",

However, some side reactions are commonly observed. Most side reactions occur due to the Lewis-acidity of the byproduct, ZnI2. In reactions that produce acid-sensitive products, excess Et2Zn can be added to scavenge the ZnI2 that is formed, forming the less acidic EtZnI. The reaction can also be quenched with pyridine, which will scavenge ZnI2 and excess reagents.",

Indeed, IUPAC decided that the credit for the discovery of element 106 should be awarded to Berkeley. Along the same lines, the German group protested against naming element 108 by the American suggestion \"hahnium\", mentioning the long-standing convention that an element is named by its discoverers. In addition, given that many American books had already used rutherfordium and hahnium for 104 and 105, the ACS objected to those names being used for other elements.",

See polyatomic ion for a list of possible ions. For cations that take on multiple charges, the charge is written using Roman numerals in parentheses immediately following the element name. For example, Cu(NO3)2 is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions () is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal.

Several substituted triptycenes are known. Barrelenes are structurally related. Due to the rigid framework and three-dimensional geometry, derivatives of triptycene have been well researched. Synthesis The parent triptycene was first prepared in 1942 by a multistep method. It can also be prepared in one step in 28% yield from the Diels–Alder reaction of anthracene and benzyne. In this method, benzyne is generated by the reaction of magnesium and 2-bromofluorobenzene.",

It was Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel, momentarily embodied in us, that drew the admiration and applause... Further, \"All in Color\" has been the most letter-provoking feature of Xero, numerous people have requested copies, specifying that their motive is to obtain the comics articles, and if all the authors currently committed to write for the series come through with articles, the series will run well into 1962 before material runs out.",

Likewise, while SMILES notation can handle stereochemistry in some implementations it is more difficult for non-specialists to encode their structures in that way than by drawing them.

SLN differs from SMILES in several significant ways. SLN can specify molecules, molecular queries, and reactions in a single line notation whereas SMILES handles these through language extensions. SLN has support for relative stereochemistry, it can distinguish mixtures of enantiomers from pure molecules with pure but unresolved stereochemistry. In SMILES aromaticity is considered to be a property of both atoms and bonds whereas in SLN it is a property of bonds. Description Like SMILES, SLN is a linear language that describes molecules. This provides a lot of similarity with SMILES despite SLN's many differences from SMILES, and as a result this description will heavily compare SLN to SMILES and its extensions.",

Although these reactions had been previously investigated by Friedrich Woehler and Heinrich Buff between 1857 and 1858, Moissan and Smiles were the first to explicitly identify disilane. They referred to disilane as silicoethane. Higher members of the homologous series SinH2n+2 formed in these reactions were subsequently identified by Carl Somiesky (sometimes spelled \"Karl Somieski\") and Alfred Stock. At standard temperature and pressure, disilane is a colourless, acrid gas. Disilane and ethane have similar structures, although disilane is much more reactive.

In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810.

Oxophilicity is often stated to be related to the hardness of the element, within the HSAB theory (hard and soft (Lewis) acids and bases), but it has been shown that oxophilicity depends more on the electronegativity and effective nuclear charge of the element than on its hardness. This explains why the early transition metals, whose electronegativities and effective nuclear charges are low, are very oxophilic. Many main group compounds are also oxophilic, such as derivatives of aluminium, silicon, and phosphorus(III). The handling of oxophilic compounds often requires air-free techniques.",

In 1840, having bought Blandfields Chemicals in Canongate and moved into their premises, the company developed the first liquid essence of coffee, later supplemented by creating various carbonated beverage flavours. Having opened a London branch in 1848, in 1851 the company discovered Aloin. But the company fortunes were made from 1855, when the first Morphine injection was developed. T&H Smith was the first company to produce commercial quantities of Apomorphine, and then Diamorphine in 1887. In 1906 the company moved from Canongate to the suburban outskirts of Edinburgh at Gorgie. During World War I, the company supplied Morphine and over of Lint-based medical dressings to the",

Efficiency Compared to JSON, Smile is both more compact and more efficient to process (both to read and write). Part of this is due to more efficient binary encoding (similar to BSON, CBOR and UBJSON), but an additional feature is optional use of back references for property names and values. Back referencing allows replacing of property names and/or short (64 bytes or less) String values with 1- or 2-byte reference ids.",

Idioms occur frequently in all languages; in English alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions. Derivations Many idiomatic expressions were meant literally in their original use, but sometimes, the attribution of the literal meaning changed and the phrase itself grew away from its original roots—typically leading to a folk etymology. For instance, the phrase \"spill the beans\" (meaning to reveal a secret) is first attested in 1919, but has been claimed to originate from an ancient method of voting by depositing beans in jars, which could be spilled, prematurely revealing the results.",

His research ranged widely through his career but largely centered around organic chemistry and chemoreceptors. Beginning with Ferguson's 1958 paper in the Journal of Chemical Education, he developed a large body of knowledge around taste as it relates to the structure of organic compounds. This research eventually led to several papers on the structure-taste relationship of sweetness which put forth that compounds must have both a hydrogen bond donor and a large hydrophobic core for sweetness to be detected biochemically. In the arena of chemosensing, Ferguson also published on carcinogens and chemotherapy, helping to summarize many of the mechanisms for chemical carcinogenesis and methods for determining structure-function relationships in anticancer agents.",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Categorized as formulaic language, an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning. Idioms occur frequently in all languages; in English alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions. Derivations Many idiomatic expressions were meant literally in their original use, but sometimes, the attribution of the literal meaning changed and the phrase itself grew away from its original roots—typically leading to a folk etymology. For instance, the phrase \"spill the beans\" (meaning to reveal a secret) is first attested in 1919, but has been claimed to originate from an ancient method of voting by depositing beans in jars, which could be spilled, prematurely revealing the results.",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

For relatively simple molecules they can be more easily understood than non-systematic names, which must be learnt or looked over. However, the common or trivial name is often substantially shorter and clearer, and so preferred. These non-systematic names are often derived from an original source of the compound.

There is currently no systematic comparison across commercial software to test if such flaws exist in those packages. SMILES notation allows the specification of configuration at tetrahedral centers, and double bond geometry. These are structural features that cannot be specified by connectivity alone, and therefore SMILES which encode this information are termed isomeric SMILES.

Ulrich Schulte-Wülwer described him as \"... the strongest artistic talent that the island has produced\". Carl Arp came to Sylt in 1903. Painters like Emil Nolde, Erich Heckel, Anita Rée and Albert Aereboe moved to Sylt. Contemporary artists include the painters and sculptors Rainer Fetting and Ingo Kühl, who live in Berlin and on Sylt. Notable people",

For relatively simple molecules they can be more easily understood than non-systematic names, which must be learnt or looked over. However, the common or trivial name is often substantially shorter and clearer, and so preferred. These non-systematic names are often derived from an original source of the compound. Also, very long names may be less clear than structural formulas.

However, the common or trivial name is often substantially shorter and clearer, and so preferred. These non-systematic names are often derived from an original source of the compound.

The original \"Everson Mono\" had a MacRoman character set, and other versions were named with suffixes: \"Everson Mono Latin B\", \"Everson Mono Currency\", \"Everson Mono Armenian\" and so on. A range of fonts with the character set of the ISO/IEC 8859 series were also made. A large font distributed in 2003 was named \"Everson Mono Unicode\", but since 2008 the font has been named simply \"Everson Mono\".

Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome. Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules. To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures.

Among the tens of thousands of organic reactions that are known, hundreds of such reactions are well-known enough to be named after people. Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

Indeed, IUPAC decided that the credit for the discovery of element 106 should be awarded to Berkeley. Along the same lines, the German group protested against naming element 108 by the American suggestion \"hahnium\", mentioning the long-standing convention that an element is named by its discoverers.

Working with a research team of Hunter College Chemistry students: Paul Kozlowski, Charles Paszkowski, and Paul Tewfik, under the guidance of Professor Donna McGregor, the artist underwent multiple experiments to collect aromatic elements from her body. She was subject to rigorous sessions to extract the concentrated essence of her sweat, tears, and hair to create an olfactory-based self-portrait that would engage visitors in a visceral form of communication without visuality as primary form.",

This research eventually led to several papers on the structure-taste relationship of sweetness which put forth that compounds must have both a hydrogen bond donor and a large hydrophobic core for sweetness to be detected biochemically. In the arena of chemosensing, Ferguson also published on carcinogens and chemotherapy, helping to summarize many of the mechanisms for chemical carcinogenesis and methods for determining structure-function relationships in anticancer agents.",

Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory hygiene). One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914. He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a sapophore) that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple hydroxyl groups and those containing chlorine atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller molecular weights were often sweeter than the larger compounds.",

Early life and education Smith was born 18 June 1871, the daughter of Thomas Smith, Commission Agent from County Down, Northern Ireland. She was educated at Crescent House school in Bedford. She matriculated at the University College of North Wales in 1897 and graduated with a B.Sc (London) in 1901 before taking up work as a demonstrator there. Smith was awarded an 1851 exhibition scholarship and chose to use it to conduct research at Owens College, Manchester from 1901 to 1903. Whilst at Owens College, she worked with both William Henry Perkin Jr. and K. J. P. Orton. Smith's research with Perkins resulted in four important research papers being published on structure determinations and new synthetic routes in organic chemistry between 1902 and 1904.",

This research eventually led to several papers on the structure-taste relationship of sweetness which put forth that compounds must have both a hydrogen bond donor and a large hydrophobic core for sweetness to be detected biochemically. In the arena of chemosensing, Ferguson also published on carcinogens and chemotherapy, helping to summarize many of the mechanisms for chemical carcinogenesis and methods for determining structure-function relationships in anticancer agents.",

This research eventually led to several papers on the structure-taste relationship of sweetness which put forth that compounds must have both a hydrogen bond donor and a large hydrophobic core for sweetness to be detected biochemically. In the arena of chemosensing, Ferguson also published on carcinogens and chemotherapy, helping to summarize many of the mechanisms for chemical carcinogenesis and methods for determining structure-function relationships in anticancer agents.",

There were found to be six allotropes of plutonium, more than any other metal, and its melting point turned out to be hundred of degrees lower than uranium. The metallurgists found that at around 125 °C, plutonium expanded in volume by 20 percent, which is unusual.",

Early organic chemists tasted many of their products, either intentionally (as a means of characterization) or accidentally (due to poor laboratory hygiene). One of the first attempts to draw systematic correlations between molecules' structures and their tastes was made by a German chemist, Georg Cohn, in 1914. He hypothesized that to evoke a certain taste, a molecule must contain some structural motif (called a sapophore) that produces that taste. With regard to sweetness, he noted that molecules containing multiple hydroxyl groups and those containing chlorine atoms are often sweet, and that among a series of structurally similar compounds, those with smaller molecular weights were often sweeter than the larger compounds.",

The villains, led by \"Dr. Phibes\" (based primarily upon Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers series, and named after Vincent Price's character from The Abominable Dr. Phibes), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! ran for two seasons on The CW.

It has three chiral centres very close together, which combine to produce an amino acetal arrangement. Its empirical formula is C23H21F7N4O3. Aprepitant is an off-white crystalline solid that has a molecular weight of around 534.53. It has a very limited solubility in water. It does have a reasonably high solubility in non-polar molecules such as oils. This would, therefore, suggest that aprepitant as a whole, despite having components that are polar, is a non-polar substance. Synthesis",

She matriculated at the University College of North Wales in 1897 and graduated with a B.Sc (London) in 1901 before taking up work as a demonstrator there. Smith was awarded an 1851 exhibition scholarship and chose to use it to conduct research at Owens College, Manchester from 1901 to 1903. Whilst at Owens College, she worked with both William Henry Perkin Jr. and K. J. P. Orton.

The style in which certain characters are drawn has changed from the early years of the strip to today. For example, the old style of the King's head was more rectangular, he had a crown with identifiable card suits on it (club, diamond, heart), his mustache and beard always hid his mouth, and his beard frequently extended to a curved point when the King was shown in profile (see The Wondrous Wizard of Id, 1970, Fawcett Publications). In the new style, the King's head is more trapezoidal with a slightly smaller and undecorated crown, he has a huge nose (even bigger than Rodney's) which covers his mouth and chin, and when he opens his mouth it appears that his beard has been shaved off.

IUPAC names can sometimes be simpler than older names, as with ethanol, instead of ethyl alcohol. For relatively simple molecules they can be more easily understood than non-systematic names, which must be learnt or looked over. However, the common or trivial name is often substantially shorter and clearer, and so preferred. These non-systematic names are often derived from an original source of the compound. Also, very long names may be less clear than structural formulas. Basic principles In chemistry, a number of prefixes, suffixes and infixes are used to describe the type and position of the functional groups in the compound.",

This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal.

These early naming conventions fit the Czech language and, being mostly work of a single person, provided a consistent way to name chemical compounds. Over time, the nomenclature expanded considerably, following the recommendations by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in recent era. Unlike the nomenclature that is used in biology or medicine, the chemical nomenclature stays closer to the Czech language, uses Czech pronunciation and inflection rules but developed its own, very complex, system of morphemes (taken from Greek and Latin), grammar, syntax, punctuation and use of brackets and numerals. Certain terms (such as etanol - ethanol) use the phonetic transcription, but the rules for spelling are inconsistent.",

The Smurfs frequently replace both nouns and verbs in everyday speech with the word \"smurf\": \"We're going smurfing on the River Smurf today.\" When used as a verb, the word \"Smurf\" typically means \"to make\", \"to be\", \"to like\", or \"to do\".",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Given the difficulty of obtaining alkahest, Helmont suggested the use of other, inferior substances that they believed were capable of similar tasks. Volatile salt of tartar, also known as pyrotartaric acid or glutaric acid, was considered both a substitute for alkahest and a component of alkahest.

They are of two types: Formed by replacing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH by some other radical, usually an alkyl or aryl radical forming an ester. For example, methyl benzoate is a molecular compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O–CH3, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5COOCH3. Formed by removing the hydrogen atom in the –COOH, producing an anion, which joins with a cation forming a salt. For example, the sodium benzoate is an ionic compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O− Na+, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5CO2Na. The suffix comes from \"-oic acid\".

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Early life and education Smith was born 18 June 1871, the daughter of Thomas Smith, Commission Agent from County Down, Northern Ireland. She was educated at Crescent House school in Bedford. She matriculated at the University College of North Wales in 1897 and graduated with a B.Sc (London) in 1901 before taking up work as a demonstrator there. Smith was awarded an 1851 exhibition scholarship and chose to use it to conduct research at Owens College, Manchester from 1901 to 1903. Whilst at Owens College, she worked with both William Henry Perkin Jr. and K. J. P. Orton. Smith's research with Perkins resulted in four important research papers being published on structure determinations and new synthetic routes in organic chemistry between 1902 and 1904.",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

This can react with almost all alkenes and alkynes, including styrenes and alcohols. This is especially useful, as the unmodified Simmons-Smith is known to deprotonate alcohols. Unfortunately, as in Pathway B shown the intermediate can also react with the starting diazo compound, giving cis- or trans- 1,2-diphenylethene.

Among others, the haloalkylzinc-mediated reaction is compatible with alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and derivatives, carbonates, sulfones, sulfonates, silanes, and stannanes. However, some side reactions are commonly observed. Most side reactions occur due to the Lewis-acidity of the byproduct, ZnI2. In reactions that produce acid-sensitive products, excess Et2Zn can be added to scavenge the ZnI2 that is formed, forming the less acidic EtZnI. The reaction can also be quenched with pyridine, which will scavenge ZnI2 and excess reagents.",

It is true that many potential workers in this field have been turned away by the odour, but this is heavily outweighed by the fact that isonitriles can be detected even in traces, and that most of the routes leading to the formation of isonitriles were discovered through the odor of these compounds.\" Isocyanides have been investigated as potential non-lethal weapons.

It has also been found to be especially useful for the cyclopropanation of carbohydrates, being far more reproducible than other methods. Like the unmodified reaction, the Furukawa-modified reaction is stereospecific, and is often much faster than the unmodified reaction.

The American subsidiary was established two years later and continued to publish it. During World War I the US government seized Merck's US operations and made it a separate American \"Merck\" company that continued to publish the Merck Index. In 2012 the Merck Index was licensed to the Royal Society of Chemistry. An online version of The Merck Index, including historic records and new updates not in the print edition, is commonly available through research libraries.

See polyatomic ion for a list of possible ions. For cations that take on multiple charges, the charge is written using Roman numerals in parentheses immediately following the element name. For example, Cu(NO3)2 is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions () is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal. For a simple overview see , for more details see selected pages from IUPAC rules for naming inorganic compounds .",

When the band did not succeed, McCormick, who had started her career singing songs by Tina Turner, Etta James and others, was added as a front woman and lead vocalist. The group were then discovered by 1960s rocker Del Shannon in a nightclub in Los Angeles. Shannon arranged \"Baby It's You\" for the group and got them signed to the ABC-Dunhill label.",

Among others, the haloalkylzinc-mediated reaction is compatible with alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and derivatives, carbonates, sulfones, sulfonates, silanes, and stannanes. However, some side reactions are commonly observed. Most side reactions occur due to the Lewis-acidity of the byproduct, ZnI2. In reactions that produce acid-sensitive products, excess Et2Zn can be added to scavenge the ZnI2 that is formed, forming the less acidic EtZnI. The reaction can also be quenched with pyridine, which will scavenge ZnI2 and excess reagents.",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

The Thorpe–Ziegler reaction is the intramolecular modification with a dinitrile as a reactant and a cyclic ketone after acid hydrolysis. In the Guareschi-Thorpe condensation cyanoacetamide reacts with a 1,3-diketone to a 2-pyridone. Publications Thorpe wrote many papers, particularly in the Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions; some are cited by Linstead. He also wrote three books, all available in the British Library: J. C. Cain and J. F. Thorpe, The synthetic dyestuffs and the intermediate products from which they are derived (1905); C. K.

One example, thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde is prepared by the reaction of hexamine with 2-chloromethylthiophene. The reaction is formally an oxidation of the carbon. Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by \"Dr. Phibes\" (based primarily upon Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers series, and named after Vincent Price's character from The Abominable Dr. Phibes), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! ran for two seasons on The CW.

It was Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel, momentarily embodied in us, that drew the admiration and applause... Further, \"All in Color\" has been the most letter-provoking feature of Xero, numerous people have requested copies, specifying that their motive is to obtain the comics articles, and if all the authors currently committed to write for the series come through with articles, the series will run well into 1962 before material runs out.",

She matriculated at the University College of North Wales in 1897 and graduated with a B.Sc (London) in 1901 before taking up work as a demonstrator there. Smith was awarded an 1851 exhibition scholarship and chose to use it to conduct research at Owens College, Manchester from 1901 to 1903. Whilst at Owens College, she worked with both William Henry Perkin Jr. and K. J. P. Orton.

This research eventually led to several papers on the structure-taste relationship of sweetness which put forth that compounds must have both a hydrogen bond donor and a large hydrophobic core for sweetness to be detected biochemically. In the arena of chemosensing, Ferguson also published on carcinogens and chemotherapy, helping to summarize many of the mechanisms for chemical carcinogenesis and methods for determining structure-function relationships in anticancer agents.",

The original \"Everson Mono\" had a MacRoman character set, and other versions were named with suffixes: \"Everson Mono Latin B\", \"Everson Mono Currency\", \"Everson Mono Armenian\" and so on. A range of fonts with the character set of the ISO/IEC 8859 series were also made. A large font distributed in 2003 was named \"Everson Mono Unicode\", but since 2008 the font has been named simply \"Everson Mono\".

In the course of his studies, A.W. Hofmann synthesized a number of N-haloamines and N-haloamides and investigated their reactions under acidic and basic conditions. He reported that the treatment of 1-bromo-2-propylpiperidine (3) with hot sulfuric acid, followed by basic work-up, resulted in the formation of a tertiary amine, which was later shown to be δ-coneceine (4).",

Indeed, IUPAC decided that the credit for the discovery of element 106 should be awarded to Berkeley. Along the same lines, the German group protested against naming element 108 by the American suggestion \"hahnium\", mentioning the long-standing convention that an element is named by its discoverers.

Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from IUPAC. Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a parent structure within the molecule of interest.

Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome. Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules. To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures.

See polyatomic ion for a list of possible ions. For cations that take on multiple charges, the charge is written using Roman numerals in parentheses immediately following the element name. For example, Cu(NO3)2 is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions () is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal. For a simple overview see , for more details see selected pages from IUPAC rules for naming inorganic compounds .",

In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810.

For relatively simple molecules they can be more easily understood than non-systematic names, which must be learnt or looked over. However, the common or trivial name is often substantially shorter and clearer, and so preferred. These non-systematic names are often derived from an original source of the compound. Also, very long names may be less clear than structural formulas.

In empirical formulas, these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound—as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can always be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of ethanol may be written C2H6O, because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written as empirical formulas which contains only the whole numbers. An example is boron carbide, whose formula of CBn is a variable non-whole number ratio, with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5.",

Beginning from about 1858, many scientists from several countries took part in the early development of structural theory, including August Kekule, Archibald Scott Couper, and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Butlerov. It was Butlerov who coined the phrase \"chemical structure\" in the following quotation from an article published in 1861: …the chemical nature of a compound molecule depends on the nature and quantity of its elementary constituents and its chemical structure.

The formula weight is a synonym of molar mass that is frequently used for non-molecular compounds, such as ionic salts. The molar mass is an intensive property of the substance, that does not depend on the size of the sample. In the International System of Units (SI), the coherent unit of molar mass is kg/mol. However, for historical reasons, molar masses are almost always expressed in g/mol. The mole was defined in such a way that the molar mass of a compound, in g/mol, is numerically equal (for all practical purposes) to the average mass of one molecule, in daltons. Thus, for example, the average mass of a molecule of water is about 18.0153 daltons, and the molar mass of water is about 18.0153 g/mol.",

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

For example, Cu(NO3)2 is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions () is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal.

Indeed, IUPAC decided that the credit for the discovery of element 106 should be awarded to Berkeley. Along the same lines, the German group protested against naming element 108 by the American suggestion \"hahnium\", mentioning the long-standing convention that an element is named by its discoverers.

For example, the sodium benzoate is an ionic compound with the structure C6H5–CO–O− Na+, and its condensed structural formula usually written as C6H5CO2Na. The suffix comes from \"-oic acid\". The most common examples of compounds named with the \"oate\" suffix are esters, like ethyl acetate, . References oate",

See polyatomic ion for a list of possible ions. For cations that take on multiple charges, the charge is written using Roman numerals in parentheses immediately following the element name. For example, Cu(NO3)2 is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions () is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal.

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

See polyatomic ion for a list of possible ions. For cations that take on multiple charges, the charge is written using Roman numerals in parentheses immediately following the element name. For example, Cu(NO3)2 is copper(II) nitrate, because the charge of two nitrate ions () is 2 × −1 = −2, and since the net charge of the ionic compound must be zero, the Cu ion has a 2+ charge. This compound is therefore copper(II) nitrate. In the case of cations with a +4 oxidation state, the only acceptable format for the Roman numeral 4 is IV and not IIII. The Roman numerals in fact show the oxidation number, but in simple ionic compounds (i.e., not metal complexes) this will always equal the ionic charge on the metal. For a simple overview see , for more details see selected pages from IUPAC rules for naming inorganic compounds .",

In 1840, having bought Blandfields Chemicals in Canongate and moved into their premises, the company developed the first liquid essence of coffee, later supplemented by creating various carbonated beverage flavours. Having opened a London branch in 1848, in 1851 the company discovered Aloin. But the company fortunes were made from 1855, when the first Morphine injection was developed.

Lorainne Ali of Rolling Stone called it a \"cacophony of voices chanting the title on top of guitar work by Dave Navarro\". Ali went on to praise Manson's vocal performance, saying \"surprisingly, he sounds pretty good.\" Entertainment Weeklys David Browne panned the title of the song for attempting to be shocking. Annalee Newitz of Salon said that the track was one of the album's \"bad judgment blips\", writing that \"'I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me),' with its misplaced soul backing vocals and Billy Squire-esque sound, made it onto the album for entirely mysterious reasons.\"",

The last section of the book served to lessen the fear associated with using these drugs based on fact. Bliss and Long discuss the ways that physicians have come to fear sulfanilamide and its derivatives, and go through the ways in which those fears are unfounded. They say “we think that a realization of the possible toxic effects, based on intelligence rather than fear, is demanded of physicians if a rational therapeutic use is to be made of sulfanilamide and its",

Nicky struggles with the simmering resentment he feels for his vainglorious and promiscuous mother, his own weakness for cocaine, and, in the view of some commentators, his repressed homosexuality. Bunty breaks off her engagement with Nicky and seeks Tom's comfort. Florence catches them kissing. Act III The next morning Helen asks Florence to think of her son, but Florence is more concerned with blaming Tom and Bunty. Nicky arrives as Helen leaves, and he and Florence quarrel more. He reveals his drug habit to her and begs her to give up her selfish ways and to behave like a mother. In the end, the two each agree to try to change, as Florence strokes Nicky's hair.",

(In fact, most SMILES software can correctly infer that the bond between the two rings cannot be aromatic and so will accept the nonstandard form c1ccccc1c2ccccc2.) The Daylight and OpenEye algorithms for generating canonical SMILES differ in their treatment of aromaticity. Branching Branches are described with parentheses, as in CCC(=O)O for propionic acid and FC(F)F for fluoroform. The first atom within the parentheses, and the first atom after the parenthesized group, are both bonded to the same branch point atom.

He resumed his graduate studies in 1922 at University of Toronto and received a master's degree in Physics in 1923. His master's thesis work on triboluminescence spectra, the frequencies of light generated by breaking chemical bonds, was done under the supervision of John Cunningham McLennan, one of the leading physicists in Canada at the time. Beals spent one year as the Science Master at the High School of Quebec in Quebec City, before enrolling in a graduate programme in physics in 1924 at the Royal College of Science at Imperial College London. Working under Alfred Fowler, he studied the Zeeman effect and the spectra of palladium, copper, and ionized silver. During this time Beals became acquainted with observational astronomy by using the small observatory in the Royal College of Science building. He received a Ph.D. in 1926.",

The coin was reintroduced in 101 BC as a replacement for the victoriatus, this time valued at 8 asses due to retariffing of the denarius to 16 asses in 118 BC. For a few years following its reintroduction, large quantities of quinarii were produced, mostly for circulation in Gaul. The coin was produced sporadically until the 3rd century. Its symbol is 𐆗.

It was released in both Ireland and the United Kingdom on 5 June 2006 by RCA Records (although the back of the album bears the RCA Music Group logo instead). The album is a mix of pop and folk, predominantly written by Thom herself alongside Tom Gilbert. The album produced Thom's first number-one single—\"I Wish I Was a Punk Rocker (With Flowers in My Hair)\"—on the UK Singles Chart, the Irish Singles Chart, and Australia's ARIA Singles Chart. In the latter country, the song spent the longest period at number-one in 2006 (10 weeks) and became the country's highest-selling single for 2006. The album also generated another two singles, but they both failed to replicate the success of the first single. Smile...

For example, the old style of the King's head was more rectangular, he had a crown with identifiable card suits on it (club, diamond, heart), his mustache and beard always hid his mouth, and his beard frequently extended to a curved point when the King was shown in profile (see The Wondrous Wizard of Id, 1970, Fawcett Publications). In the new style, the King's head is more trapezoidal with a slightly smaller and undecorated crown, he has a huge nose (even bigger than Rodney's) which covers his mouth and chin, and when he opens his mouth it appears that his beard has been shaved off.

Being a heterocyclic compound, benzoxazole finds use in research as a starting material for the synthesis of larger, usually bioactive structures. Its aromaticity makes it relatively stable, although as a heterocycle, it has reactive sites which allow for functionalization. Occurrence and applications It is found within the chemical structures of pharmaceutical drugs such as flunoxaprofen and tafamidis. Benzoxazole derivatives are also of interest for optical brighteners in laundry detergents. Benzoxazoles belong to the group of well-known antifungal agents with antioxidant, antiallergic, antitumoral and antiparasitic activity.",

It is an intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the type: where X in the arene compound can be a sulfone, a sulfide, an ether or any substituent capable of dislodging from the arene carrying a negative charge. The terminal functional group in the chain end Y is able to act as a strong nucleophile for instance an alcohol, amine or thiol. As in other nucleophilic aromatic substitutions the arene requires activation by an electron-withdrawing group preferably in the aromatic ortho position. In one modification called the Truce–Smiles rearrangement the incoming nucleophile is sufficiently strong that the arene does not require this additional activation, for example when the nucleophile is an organolithium. This reaction is exemplified by the conversion of an aryl sulfone into a sulfinic acid by action of n-butyllithium:",

However, some side reactions are commonly observed. Most side reactions occur due to the Lewis-acidity of the byproduct, ZnI2. In reactions that produce acid-sensitive products, excess Et2Zn can be added to scavenge the ZnI2 that is formed, forming the less acidic EtZnI.

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Among others, the haloalkylzinc-mediated reaction is compatible with alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and derivatives, carbonates, sulfones, sulfonates, silanes, and stannanes. However, some side reactions are commonly observed. Most side reactions occur due to the Lewis-acidity of the byproduct, ZnI2. In reactions that produce acid-sensitive products, excess Et2Zn can be added to scavenge the ZnI2 that is formed, forming the less acidic EtZnI. The reaction can also be quenched with pyridine, which will scavenge ZnI2 and excess reagents.",

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Similar to another alchemical idealized substance, alkahest, azoth was the aim, goal and vision of many alchemical works. Its symbol was the Caduceus. The term, while originally a term for an occult formula sought by alchemists much like the philosopher's stone, became a poetic word for the element mercury. The name is Medieval Latin, an alteration of azoc, being originally derived from the Arabic al-zā'būq \"the mercury\", even if it is a common misconception of the era to link azoth as mercury alone rather than the addition of mercury, salt and sulfur when it comes to the senses and symbols.",

This yields 1-(5-bromopentyl)-1-methyl-7-methoxy-2-tetralone, which is then cyclized with NaH to produce 5-methyl-3-methoxy-5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12-octahydro-5,11-methanobenzocyclodecen-13-one. The product is then treated with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, to yield an oxime. A reduction reaction in hydrogen gas produces an isomeric mixture, from which the final product is crystallized and cleaved with HBr. History Dezocine was patented by American Home Products Corp. in 1978. Clinical trials ran from 1979 to 1985, before its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1986.

It appeared on his 1965 album, I Must Be Seeing Things, and AllMusic noted that it \"allowed Pitney to explore the extent of his dramatic range with its tale of the giddy highs and painful lows of a love affair\". The song became a Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, although it failed to register in the Top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 64. \"Just One Smile\" was Pitney's seventh consecutive Top Ten hit single in the UK. \"Just One Smile\" was covered by Blood, Sweat & Tears on their 1968 album, Child Is Father to the Man. That version was just one of a number of covers of the song, which have been recorded by Dusty Springfield, Eternity's Children, Walter Jackson, Sheena Easton, and the Sensations, amongst others. For example, Marcia Hines covered the song on her Ladies and Gentlemen album (1977).",

Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to surface. During the Come Taste the Band tour many fans openly booed Bolin's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that Bolin was physically hampered by his addiction.

Unfortunately, as in Pathway B shown the intermediate can also react with the starting diazo compound, giving cis- or trans- 1,2-diphenylethene.

Among others, the haloalkylzinc-mediated reaction is compatible with alkynes, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and derivatives, carbonates, sulfones, sulfonates, silanes, and stannanes. However, some side reactions are commonly observed. Most side reactions occur due to the Lewis-acidity of the byproduct, ZnI2. In reactions that produce acid-sensitive products, excess Et2Zn can be added to scavenge the ZnI2 that is formed, forming the less acidic EtZnI. The reaction can also be quenched with pyridine, which will scavenge ZnI2 and excess reagents.",

Woodward published a very brief account on the strychnine synthesis in 1954 (just 3 pages) and a lengthy one (42 pages) in 1963. Many more methods exist and reported by the research groups of Magnus, Overman, Kuehne, Rawal, Bosch, Vollhardt, Mori, Shibasaki, Li, Fukuyama Vanderwal and MacMillan. Synthetic (+)-strychnine is also known. Racemic synthesises were published by Padwa in 2007 and in 2010 by Andrade and by Reissig.

It is named after Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. and Ronald D. Smith. It uses a methylene free radical intermediate that is delivered to both carbons of the alkene simultaneously, therefore the configuration of the double bond is preserved in the product and the reaction is stereospecific. Thus, cyclohexene, diiodomethane, and a zinc-copper couple (as iodomethylzinc iodide, ICH2ZnI) yield norcarane (bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane). The Simmons–Smith reaction is generally preferred over other methods of cyclopropanation, however it can be expensive due to the high cost of diiodomethane. Modifications involving cheaper alternatives have been developed, such as dibromomethane or diazomethane and zinc iodide. The reactivity of the system can also be increased by using the Furukawa modification, exchanging the zinc‑copper couple for diethylzinc.",

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

Propionic acid is CH3CH2C(=O)OH(\\scriptstyle CH3CH2C(=O)OH). Reactions SLN supports reactions with -> connecting the reactants and the products. Atom mapping is possible with the use of [#num] attributes. The reaction center (rc) attribute can be added to bonds, and the chiral conversion (cc) attribute to atoms. Misc. Multiple lines can be merged into a syntactical line by writing a \\ (backslash) at the end of each line. This allows for breaking a long line into multiple lines, for example in a reaction with each molecule on its own line.

However, a single substance can have more than one acceptable name, like toluene, which may also be correctly named as \"methylbenzene\" or \"phenylmethane\". Some alternative names remain available as \"retained names\" for more general contexts. For example, tetrahydrofuran remains an unambiguous and acceptable name for the common organic solvent, even if the preferred IUPAC name is \"oxolane\".",
