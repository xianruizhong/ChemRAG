In this work, we make a profound review of juglone synthesis methodology, the biological actions of juglone, and mainly the synthesis and pharmacological actions of juglone derivatives.

Tremorgens have been implicated in a number of neurologic diseases of cattle collectively known as staggers syndromes, and pose significant agricultural and health problems for both cattle and humans. Although the effects of tremorgens are thought to result from transient perturbations of amino acid neurotransmitter release mechanisms, there is reason to believe that acute exposures to toxins with such synaptic effects may result in degeneration of neuronal fiber processes. To test this hypothesis, rats were given a single tremorgenic (3 mg/kg, IP) dose of aflatrem, and kinetics of amino acid neurotransmitter uptake was assessed in isolated hippocampal nerve terminals at 1 day, 1 week, and 2 weeks after injection. Results indicate a decrease in the capacity of the GABA and glutamate uptake systems, which was interpreted as a loss of nerve terminals. The affinity constants suggest a decrease in release of these transmitters as well. In addition to its transient influence on transmitter release, a single low dose of aflatrem is able to induce degeneration of neuronal processes in hippocampal neurotransmitter systems and therefore represents a long-term health threat.",

Their biosynthetic gene (ftm) cluster was identified on the basis of the genome sequence of A. fumigatus. However, it has been reported that the ftm cluster in genome reference strain Af293 is inactive, which makes complete understanding of the FTM pathway difficult. Hence, we used an FTM-producing strain of A. fumigatus, BM939, to dissect the FTM pathway. Here, we delineate the genetic determinant for the observed defect in the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293. Metabolite profiling and sequence comparison of the two strains revealed a point mutation in ftmD as a possible cause of altered metabolite production in strain Af293. FTM production in Af293 was restored when a DNA fragment containing ftmD from BM939 was introduced. Biochemical analysis indicated that FtmD is a methyltransferase that catalyzes the conversion of 6-hydroxytryprostatin B into tryprostatin A. The mutated FtmD retained enzymatic activity but did not function under physiological conditions, resulting in blockage of the FTM pathway in A. fumigatus Af293.",

Southern blotting revealed that three out of four independently isolated strains of S. albidoflavus possess facC.

De novo design with machine intelligence bridges the gap between the worlds of bioactive natural products and synthetic molecules. On employing the compound Marinopyrrole A from marine Streptomyces as a design template, the algorithm constructs innovative small molecules that can be synthesized in three steps, following the computationally suggested synthesis route. Computational activity prediction reveals cyclooxygenase (COX) as a putative target of both Marinopyrrole A and the de novo designs. The molecular designs are experimentally confirmed as selective COX-1 inhibitors with nanomolar potency. X-ray structure analysis reveals the binding of the most selective compound to COX-1.

The units can be synthetic material science-based or derived from functional biological macromolecules. Autonomous biological building blocks with available structures provide an extremely rich and useful resource for design. For proteins, the structural databases contain large libraries of protein molecules and their building blocks with a range of shapes, surfaces, and chemical properties. The introduction of engineered synthetic residues or short peptides into these can expand the available chemical space and enhance the desired properties.

This parameterization is based on the generation of weighting factors that reflect the knowledge and knowledge-based intuition of the drug designer, and thus add further rationalization to the drug design process.

The structure revealed that OABP2.1 consists of two α-helical domains, with the OA molecule deeply buried inside the protein. In addition, the global fold of OABP2.1 was unexpectedly similar to that of aequorin, a jellyfish photoprotein.

This toxin is a tumor promoter C38 polyether fatty acid that contains acidic and hydrophobic moieties and is cyclic. Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of important classes of protein serine/threonine phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 and 2A. The toxin binds in a hydrophobic groove adjacent to the active site of the protein phosphatases and interacts with basic residues within the active site. Therefore okadaic acid causes increases in phosphorylation of proteins that affect a diverse array of cellular processes. For instance, this toxin modulates metabolic parameters in intact cells. In this sense it stimulates lipolysis, and inhibits fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes however increases glucose output and gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Additionally, okadaic acid reaches cytotoxic concentrations in the intestinal tissues in accordance with the diarrhea. Recent studies suggested that toxic effects of okadaic acid might be related to modification of nutrients, ionic and water absorption across the small intestine presumably by altering the transporter system. The subject of this review is limited to the effect of okadaic acid on glucose regulation and its cellular as well as clinical implications.",

Disabling the calmodulin kinase II that is thought to respond to the mitotic Cai signal using a peptide inhibitor fails to prevent mitosis in response to okadaic acid.

However, only one diol ester and no sulfated diesters of DTX-1, a closely related DSP toxin, have been isolated leading some to speculate that this toxin is not stored as a sulfated diester and is processed by some other means.

This review provides a historical perspective on the role that okadaic acid has played in stimulating a broad spectrum of modern scientific research as a result of the natural product's ability to bind to and inhibit important classes of protein serine / threonine phosphatases. The relationships between the structure and biological activities of okadaic acid are briefly reviewed, as well as the structural information regarding the particular cellular receptors protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A. Laboratory syntheses of okadaic acid and its analogs are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, an interpretation of the critical contacts observed between okadaic acid and PP1 by X-ray crystallography is provided, and specific molecular recognition hypotheses that are testable via the synthesis and assay of non-natural analogs of okadaic acid are suggested.",

It has a unique action on the Na,K-ATPase, converting the pump into an ion channel and resulting in K(+) efflux, Na(+) influx and membrane depolarization. As a result palytoxin causes a wide spectrum of secondary pharmacological actions. By acting like a key to unlock the internal structure of the Na,K-ATPase, palytoxin holds promise as a useful tool for investigation of the pump molecule.",

Knowledge of the correct structures for these toxins is important in understanding their toxicology, biochemistry, and biosynthesis. We have performed extensive NMR analyses on okadaic acid (1), dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), and dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2) obtained from natural sources. Consequently, we were able to unambiguously deduce the stereochemistries at C-35 for DTX-1 and DTX-2 based on analysis of NMR coupling constants and NOE interactions. Our results revealed that DTX-2 (3) has a stereochemistry opposite to that of DTX-1 (2) at C-35. Molecular modeling of the docking of 1-3 with protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) suggested that the reduced affinity of DTX-2 for PP2A may be due to the newly defined stereochemistry at the 35-methyl group. The implications of these findings for biosynthesis and toxicology are discussed.",

It is a traditional medicine, having some active ingredients used for the treatment of numerous diseases. During recent research on ginger, various ingredients like zingerone, shogaol, and paradol have been obtained from it. Zingerone (4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-2-butanone) is a nontoxic and inexpensive compound with varied pharmacological activities. It is the least pungent component of Zingiber officinale. Zingerone is absent in fresh ginger but cooking or heating transforms gingerol to zingerone. Zingerone closely related to vanillin from vanilla and eugenol from clove. Zingerone has potent anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antilipolytic, antidiarrhoeic, antispasmodic, and so forth properties. Besides, it displays the property of enhancing growth and immune stimulation. It behaves as appetite stimulant, anxiolytic, antithrombotic, radiation protective, and antimicrobial. Also, it inhibits the reactive nitrogen species which are important in causing Alzheimer's disease and many other disorders. This review is written to shed light on the various pharmacological properties of zingerone and its role in alleviating numerous human and animal diseases. ",

This usually implies that costly and time-consuming experimentation is required for clone identification and optimization of biosimilar glycosylation. Here, a computational method that utilizes a Markov model of glycosylation to predict optimal glycoengineering strategies to obtain a specific glycosylation profile with desired properties is described. The approach uses a genetic algorithm to find the required quantities to perturb glycosylation reaction rates that lead to the best possible match with a given glycosylation profile. Furthermore, the approach can be used to identify cell lines and clones that will require minimal intervention while achieving a glycoprofile that is most similar to the desired profile.

The supply chain issue hinders the development of novel therapeutic agents from natural products. Microbial synthesis, based on the expression of biosynthetic genes in a suitable microbial host to produce certain chemicals, is a sustainable strategy to produce complex natural products. However, this strategy requires gaining insights into the biosynthesis of target molecules. Most natural products are biosynthetically unknown or not fully elucidated; thus, the sole application of microbial synthesis strategy to produce a given molecule is challenging. In this review, we highlight a strategy that combines microbial and chemical syntheses to tackle the supply chain issue in developing drugs from natural products.

On the basis of the resultant data, we then designed a biotinylated xestoquinone analogue. Xestoquinone and its analogues were derived from extracts of the marine sponge Xestospongia sapra. Four xestoquinone analogues with a quinone structure significantly inhibited Ca(2+) ATPase activity. In contrast, four xestoquinone analogues in which the quinone structure was converted to a quinol dimethyl ether did not inhibit Ca(2+) ATPase activity.

Then, we synthesized a biotinylated xestoquinone in which a biotin tag was introduced to a site far from the quinone moiety, and this molecule exhibited stronger inhibitory activity than that of xestoquinone.

The detection of chemically distinct odorants begins with the binding of an odorant ligand to a specific receptor protein in the ciliary membrane of olfactory neurons. To address the problem of olfactory perception at a molecular level, we have cloned, functionally expressed, and characterized some of the human olfactory receptors from chromosome 17. Our results show that a receptor protein is capable of recognizing the particular chemical substructure of an odor molecule and, therefore, is able to respond only to odorants that have a defined molecular structure. These findings represent the beginning of the molecular understanding of odorant recognition in humans. In the future, this knowledge could be used for the design of synthetic ideal receptors for specific odors (biosensors), or the perfect odor molecule for a given receptor.",

This protein was specifically and constitutively expressed in the sweat glands, secreted into the sweat and transported to the epidermal surface. In sweat, a proteolytically processed 47-amino acid peptide was generated that showed antimicrobial activity in response to a variety of pathogenic microorganisms. The activity of the peptide was maintained over a broad pH range and in high salt concentrations that resembled the conditions in human sweat. This indicated that sweat plays a role in the regulation of human skin flora through the presence of an antimicrobial peptide. This peptide may help limit infection by potential pathogens in the first few hours following bacterial colonization.",

Therefore, the search for new drugs for the trypanosomiasis is urgent. This review describes studies of the trypanocidal properties of essential oils, an important group of natural products widely found in several tropical countries. Seventy-seven plants were selected from literature for the trypanocidal activity of their essential oils. The main chemical constituents and mechanisms of action are also discussed. In vitro and in vivo experimental data show the therapeutic potential of these natural products for the treatment of infections caused by species of <iTrypanosoma</i.",

The proposed designing process mimics the classical manual design method, in which the drug designer sits in front of the computer screen and with the aid of computer graphics attempts to design the new drug. Therefore, the key principle of the algorithm is the parameterization of some criteria that affect the decision-making process carried out by the drug designer. This parameterization is based on the generation of weighting factors that reflect the knowledge and knowledge-based intuition of the drug designer, and thus add further rationalization to the drug design process. The proposed algorithm has been shown to yield a large variety of different structures, of which the drug designer may choose the most sensible.

Common to all natural self-organizing procedures is the ability of matter to store, process and evaluate the information achieved by learning. Genetic information which is stored in RNA or DNA is the object of natural evolution. With the recognition of nature's concepts, evolutionary optimization was applied to biopolymers that are not optimally adapted for particular technical or medical purposes. Information can also be stored in molecules with structures and chemical properties that are completely different from nucleic acids. Therefore, optimization processes that mimic the natural evolutionary strategies can also be applied to small organic molecules. Much effort has been made theoretically and practically to find a certain optimized species within the (hyper)astronomical number of possible sequence alternatives. From a series of computer experiments it can be concluded that it is not necessary to search the entire sequence space in order to find a particular structure; this is advantageous because the diversity of mutant libraries that can realistically be achieved in the laboratory never extends to the number of theoretically possible sequences. Molecular mutant libraries that serve as starting populations for in vitro selection have been constructed for nucleic acids, proteins, peptides and small organic molecules.",

In several recent studies, researchers have explored protein-graph remodeling, instead of looking a minimum superimposition for pairwise proteins. When graphs are used to represent structured objects, the problem of measuring object similarity become one of computing the similarity between graphs. Graph theory provides an alternative perspective as well as efficiency. Once a protein graph has been created, its structural stability must be verified. Therefore, a criterion is needed to determine if a protein graph can be used for structural comparison. In this paper, we propose a measurement for protein graph remodeling based on graph entropy. We extend the concept of graph entropy to determine whether a graph is suitable for representing a protein. The experimental results suggest that when applied, graph entropy helps a conformational on protein graph modeling. Furthermore, it indirectly contributes to protein structural comparison if a protein graph is solid. ",

We discuss studies that give physical insight into how the molecular structure can be related to photophysical properties with many of these studies being theoretical. One useful photophysical property is the ability to fluoresce with high quantum yields. Natural bases practically do not fluoresce, so being able to design molecules that fluoresce is a goal of practical importance.

Therefore, the key principle of the algorithm is the parameterization of some criteria that affect the decision-making process carried out by the drug designer. This parameterization is based on the generation of weighting factors that reflect the knowledge and knowledge-based intuition of the drug designer, and thus add further rationalization to the drug design process. The proposed algorithm has been shown to yield a large variety of different structures, of which the drug designer may choose the most sensible.

It was subjected to a sequence of transformation that included the introduction of a 2'-amino-2'-deoxy function into the glucosyl group, the inversion of C-5 in the glucose residue to give the L-ido configuration, oxidation at position 6, and cyclisation of the acyclic dimethyl acetal to give the desired pyranuronic acid. In the formation of the latter, the 5-O-levulinoyl substituent was found to be less prone to acyl migration to O-6 than more conventional ester groups. The relative acid labilities of the O-isopropylidene and dimethyl acetal groups are compared, and conformations of the acyclic residues of some disaccharide derivatives are discussed.",

The resulting, radiolabelled-disaccharides and -tetrasaccharides were isolated by gel chromatography, and then fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography, paper chromatography, and paper electrophoresis. Of the nine disaccharides isolated and identified, eight were probably derived from the major repeating-disaccharide unit in heparin (2-deoxy-2-sulfoamino-D-glucosyl 6-sulfate leads to L-idosyluronic acid 2-sulfate). Sodium borotritide reduction and/or HNO2 deamination of these eight disaccharide fractions indicated four to contain L-idopyranose residues and the other four to contain 1,6-anhydro-L-idopyranose residues as terminal units. The latter, terminal unit probably represents a minor component formed during the acid hydrolysis. On the basis of N-acetylation, N-sulfation, and HNO2-deamination studies, and the known positions and configurations of the glycosidic and sulfate linkages in heparin, four disaccharides were identified as 0-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose, 0-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glycopyranosyl)-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose 2-sulfate, and 0-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl 6-sulfate]-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose 2-sulfate. A similar set of four disaccharides contained 1,6-anhydro-L-[6-3H]idopyranose residues in place of the L-[6-3H]idopyranose residues. The other disaccharide was tentatively identified as 0-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-(1 leads to 4)-L-[6-3H]idopyranose, the isolation of which suggests the presence of an IdA(OSO-3)-GlcNAc-IdA(OSO-3) sequence in the heparin preparation, which accounts for at least 1% of its total sequence. The tetrasaccharides were fractionated, on the basis of their sulfate content, into at least five species by ion-exchange chromatography or by paper electrophoresis. These were fractionated further into species with and without carboxyl groups, and with L-idopyranose or 1,6-anhydro-L-idopyranose residues as terminal units. Tentative structures for some of these tetrasaccharides are proposed. Disaccharide and tetrasaccharide species were evaluated before and after N-acetylation or N-sulfation, as substrates for sulfamidase, acetyl-CoA: 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucoside N-acetyl-transferase, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucosidase, or 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-sulfate sulfatase in human-skin fibroblasts.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits.

This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation.

Therefore, from the chemotaxonomic point of view, it would be valuable to find a simple and rapid method to differentiate these three Chamaecyparis species. In this study, the chemical compositions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from mature leaves were analyzed using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS). Then cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted for the BVOC constituents to reveal the differences among these three species. Results from SPME-GC/MS showed that the compositions of BVOCs from the three species were distinctly different. Moreover, these species were clearly differentiated according to the results of CA and PCA. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that SPME-GC/MS coupled with CA and PCA is a feasible and rapid technique to differentiate Chamaecyparis species with similar morphological characteristics.",

The supply chain issue hinders the development of novel therapeutic agents from natural products. Microbial synthesis, based on the expression of biosynthetic genes in a suitable microbial host to produce certain chemicals, is a sustainable strategy to produce complex natural products. However, this strategy requires gaining insights into the biosynthesis of target molecules. Most natural products are biosynthetically unknown or not fully elucidated; thus, the sole application of microbial synthesis strategy to produce a given molecule is challenging.

Since such computationally modeled molecules may not adopt the intended bound conformation outside the binding pocket, one challenge is to ensure that the designed ligands adopt similar low energy conformations both inside and outside of the binding pocket. Computational chemistry methods and conformational preferences of small molecules from PDB and Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) can be used to predict the bound structures of the designed molecules. Herein, we review applications of conformational control in structure-based drug design using selected examples from the recent medicinal chemistry literature. The main purpose is to highlight some intriguing conformational features that can be applied to other drug discovery programs.",

Based on the obtained results mulleins were divided in two groups: group A (Verbascum phlomoides and Verbascum densiflorum) and group B (Verbascum xanthophoeniceum, Verbascum nigrum and Verbascum phoeniceum). Further it was found that the plants in group B accumulate higher amounts of bioactive iridoid and phenylethanoid glycosides. V. xanthophoeniceum and V. nigrum accumulate higher amounts of the pharmaceutically-important harpagoside (∼0.5% on dry weight basis) and verbascoside, forsythoside B and leucosceptoside B (in total 5.6-5.8% on dry weight basis), which underlines the possibility for their application in pharmaceutical industry. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report on the analyses of Verbascum sp. leaf metabolome.",

The magnesium atom in ethyl chlorophyllide is displaced 0.4 A from the plane of the chlorin ring in the same direction as the methyl ester substituent. A water molecule occupies the fifth coordination site. A second water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the coordinated water molecule and also to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the methyl ester.

With the avalanche of bioinformatics data, de novo design is ideally suited for exploring molecules that could be useful for chemical genomics. The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

Our strongest inhibitor showed an IC50-material value and selectivity for APC vs thrombin similar to a compound previously reported in the literature. However, in contrast to the reference compound, our compound showed a retained coagulant effect of thrombin with increasing substrate concentration in a modified Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) method. This was likely related to our compound being inactive against FVIIa, while the reference compound showed an IC50 of 8.9 μM. Thus, the higher selectivity of our compound against all relevant coagulation factors likely explained its higher therapeutic potential in comparison to the reference compound.

In this paper, the author discusses the recent research efforts that aim to build, in silico, more chemically accessible molecules, sample more efficiently the chemical space and rank the proposed molecules. The author reviews de novo design algorithms developed between 2008 and 2010 and the issue of validation, and highlights some recent successful applications of de novo design to drug discovery projects. Although research has addressed the lack of synthetic accessibility of the molecules proposed by the first generation of de novo design tools, the lack of accurate scoring function remains a major limitation of structure-based de novo design.

In a nutshell, the process of chain-length regulation can be understood as the output of a chain-elongating C-C bond forming reaction competing with a terminating fatty acid release function. At the end of each cycle in the iterative process, the synthesizing enzymes need to \"decide\" whether the growing chain is to be elongated through another cycle or released as the \"mature\" fatty acid. Recent research has shed light on the factors determining fatty acid chain length and has also achieved control over chain length for the production of the technologically interesting short-chain (C<sub4</sub -C<sub8</sub ) and medium-chain (C<sub10</sub -C<sub14</sub ) fatty acids.",

The FAO pathway can be examined by measuring the 3-hydroxy-fatty acid (3-OHFA) intermediates. We present a unique finding in the study of this pathway: the addition of medium-chain fatty acids to the culture media of fibroblasts results in generation of 3-OHFAs which are two carbons longer than the precursor substrate. Cultured skin fibroblasts from normal and LCHAD-deficient individuals were grown in media supplemented with various chain-length fatty acids. The cell-free medium was analyzed for 3-OHFAs by stable-isotope dilution gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry. Our finding suggests that a novel carbon chain-length elongation process precedes the oxidation of medium-chain fatty acids. This previously undescribed metabolic step may have important implications for the metabolism of medium-chain triglycerides, components in the dietary treatment of a number of disorders.",

Taxol productivity increased 19-fold when T. cuspidata suspension cultures were exposed to 5 ppm ethylene and 10 microM methyl jasmonate. This increase was 15-fold when either 0 or 10 ppm ethylene was combined with 10 microM methyl jasmonate. The induction of taxol occurred within 51 h after elicitation and would reduce fermentation times and costs. Ethylene concentration at 50 ppm had an inhibitory effect on taxol production but not on phosphate uptake rate, suggesting independent regulation of taxol and physiological functions of the cell. A simple induction model is proposed to explain the action and effects of both ethylene and methyl jasmonate with regard to receptor binding and regulatory systems in plants.",

This review describes the design and structures of self-assembly linear dipeptide hydrogels. The strategies for preparing the new generation of linear dipeptide hydrogels can be divided into three categories based on the modification site of dipeptide: 1) COOH-terminal and N-terminal modified dipeptide, 2) C-terminal modified dipeptide, and 3) uncapped dipeptide.

To analyze kinetic data, computer programs were developed which first calculate initial velocities from progress curves and then evaluate the kinetic parameters by nonlinear regression analysis. A free carboxyl group is a prerequisite for binding of dipeptidase substrates; its position relative to the peptide bond must not deviate from the normal L-dipeptide conformation. The spatial arrangement of the terminal ammonium ion seems to be less crucial. The enzyme's substrate specificity clearly reflects the interactions of the substrate amino acid side chains with complementary dipeptidase subsites. The domain of the enzyme in contact with the C-terminal substrate side chain seems to be an open structure of moderately hydrophobic character. In contrast, the binding site for the amino-terminal side chain is a more strongly hydrophobic \"pocket\" of limited dimensions.

Inhibition of alanine racemase is lethal to prokaryotes, creating an attractive target for designing antibacterial drugs. Here we report the crystal structure of biosynthetic alanine racemase (Alr) from a pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Structural studies showed that P. aeruginosa Alr (PaAlr) adopts a conserved homodimer structure. A guest substrate d-lysine was observed in the active site and refined to dual-conformation. Two buffer ions, malonate and acetate, were bound in the proximity to d-lysine. Biochemical characterization revealed the optimal reaction conditions for PaAlr.",

Pepsin gave peptides with the best IC50 values (mean value on three species 186 ± 10 μg/mL), followed by pepsin + trypsin (198 ± 16 μg/mL), chymotrypsin (213 ± 83 μg/mL), trypsin (405 ± 54 μg/mL), corolase PP (497 ± 32 μg/mL), umamizyme (865 ± 230 μg/mL), and flavourzyme (922 ± 91 μg/mL). The three species showed similar activity scales, but after pepsin + trypsin and chymotrypsin treatments, L. luteus peptide mixtures resulted to be significantly the most active.

The aim of the study has been to find and identify the main narrow-leafed lupin globulins that bind to specific IgEs from the sera of lupin-allergic people. Isolated lupin globulins were subjected to immunoblotting with the sera from people who suffered from lupin allergy. Incubation with alpha-methyl-D-galactopyranoside was performed to eliminate possible binding of unspecific human IgEs. The proteins binding specific IgEs from lupin-allergic patients' sera were identified by means of mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis revealed 2 signals corresponding to lupin globulins that bound to specific IgEs from the sera of people allergic to lupin. The globulins were identified as conglutin-gamma and its smaller subunit. The results suggested that individuals that displayed lupin allergy symptoms reacted to conglutin-gamma. The results of the study can contribute to identification of yet undetected allergens of narrow-leafed lupin. This, in turn, can make lupin-fortified products safer for the consumers.",

In lupins, seed oil content varies from 16% in Lupinus mutabilisto 8% in L. angustifolius. We have shown that TAGs rapidly accumulate during mid-stages of seed development in L. mutabilis compared to the lower seed oil species, L. angustifolius. In this study, we have targeted the key enzymes of the lipid biosynthetic pathway, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DAGAT), to determine factors regulating TAG accumulation between two lupin species. A twofold increase in ACCase activity was observed in L. mutabilis relative to L. angustifolius and correlated with rapid TAG accumulation. No difference in DAGAT activity was detected. We have identified, cloned and partially characterised a novel gene differentially expressed during TAG accumulation between L. angustifolius and L. mutabilis. The gene has some identity to the glucose dehydrogenase family previously described in barley and bacteria and the significance of its expression levels during seed development in relation to TAG accumulation is discussed. DNA sequence analysis of the promoter in both L. angustifolius and L. mutabilis identified putative matrix attachment regions and recognition sequences for transcription binding sites similar to those found in the Adh1 gene from Arabidopsis. The identical promoter regions between species indicate that differential gene expression is controlled by alternative transcription factors, accessibility to binding sites or a combination of both.",

Unfortunately, proteins and phenolic compounds can easily interact with each other which results in formation of complexes that affect properties of both components. Therefore, in this study, composition of the seeds storage proteins isolated from Lupinus albus and L. angustifolius and their interactions with native flavonoids were investigated. Based on the chromatographic separations, six proteins fractions of lupin seeds storage proteins were identified. The results indicate that two dominant fractions, α-conglutin and β-conglutin, constitute up to 80% of all proteins present in the seeds. Three flavonoids interacting with the proteins were identified as apigenin C-glycosides. The lowest flavonoids content was noted in the main storage proteins while in both lupin seeds species over 90% of flavonoids interacted with the proteins present in late-embryogenesis abundant (LEA) protein fraction. Protein-phenolic compound complexes can affect the digestibility of proteins and bioavailability of phenolic compounds, and thus the functional and nutritional properties of products derived from lupin seeds can be changed. Therefore, a better understanding of factors affecting the nutritional value of lupin seeds proteins and flavonoids is necessary to optimize the biological use of this plant for human nutrition. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.",

Mometasone furoate degradation leads to the formation of two products, D1 and D2 with significant pH dependence. The half-lives for the conversion of MF to D1 and subsequent conversion of D1 to D2 at 37 degrees C in SLF were 1.3 and 4.8 h respectively.

The biological activity of these degradation products was assessed in rat lung glucocorticoid receptor binding studies. D1 showed 4 fold greater receptor affinity to glucocorticoid receptors compared to dexamethasone. However, the receptor affinity for D2 was a log order lower than that for dexamethasone. The instability of MF in SLF resulted in two degradation products, one of the degradation products showing glucocorticoid receptor activity, the other representing a new cyclized structure whose pharmacological properties have not been described.

Mometasone furoate, a closely related corticosteroid currently available in an intranasal formulation, is being investigated in an oral inhalation formulation for the treatment of asthma. This article reviews available data on the comparative structure-activity relationships, chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and systemic bioavailability of fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate to assess whether claims of differences in the absolute systemic bioavailability of the 2 compounds are supported by the published literature. Information for this review was identified through a MEDLINE search of the literature from 1966 to the present that contained the term mometasone or fluticasone. The resulting list was narrowed by excluding articles dealing with dermatologic applications. A systematic review was conducted of the identified literature pertaining to the molecular structure, topical potency, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of the 2 agents. Additionally, the pharmacology of the 2 moieties was assessed by a review of the available literature on receptor binding affinity, transactivation and transrepression potency, and inhibition of inflammatory-cell cytokine expression. Based on the available data, fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate have similar physicochemical properties and structure-activity relationships. When administered intranasally, mometasone furoate is reported to have comparable relative systemic bioavailability to that of fluticasone propionate (mean plasma area under the curve, 123 pmol x h/L vs 112 pmol x h/L, respectively). When administered as a single dose by dry powder inhaler, orally inhaled fluticasone propionate is reported to have a total systemic bioavailability of approximately 17%, whereas that of mometasone furoate is reported to be &lt; 1%. However, the mometasone furoate bioavailability study that reported the latter value used lower drug doses and a less sensitive assay than the fluticasone propionate bioavailability study. When multiple-dose data were used, mometasone furoate had an estimated 11% systemic bioavailability, similar to that of fluticasone propionate. Inhaled fluticasone propionate and mometasone furoate appear to have comparable potential systemic absorption and, based on the total systemic bioavailabilities of the parent compounds, have a low potential for systemic side effects at the recommended clinical doses.

These numbers were generated by replacing all concentrations below the limit of quantification byzero and then calculating an average value.

Nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching as well as ocular, throat and ear clinical signs and general symptoms including cough and dyspnea were characterized using a symptom score. Mometasone furoate was administered intranasally in 100 micrograms doses into both nostrils. Depending on the severity of symptoms, antiallergic eye drops and systemic antihistamines were also allowed. After two weeks of treatment, a follow-up physical examination was performed and the symptom score was re-evaluated. Potential adverse events that had occurred during the treatment period were recorded. Mometasone furoate nasal spray alleviated all four nasal symptoms promptly and effectively. In particular, treatment resulted in a 93 percent decrease of overall symptom score. None of the participants discontinued treatment due to the occurrence of adverse effects.

The second generation of these compounds includes beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate, mometasone furoate, and triamcinolone acetonide. There is evidence that the INCS are effective in rhinitis; however, there is concern about the potential for these compounds to cause growth suppression. In one study, beclomethasone dipropionate significantly reduced growth in children; however, treatment of children with mometasone furoate nasal spray for 1 year showed no signs of growth suppression. It is evident that the differences among INCS lie in their pharmacokinetics. Structural differences among the various INCS influence their metabolism. The goal of INCS therapy is to have a high ratio of topical to systemic activity. The drug delivery device, absorption of the drug, and drug distribution all contribute to effective topical activity of an INCS. In addition, individual drug metabolism and elimination (half-life and drug clearance) also contribute to the therapeutic index of a drug.

This is the highest resolution structure reported for any sugar-lectin complex. As the native structure of Con A to 0.94 A resolution is already in the database, this gives us a unique opportunity to examine sugar-protein binding at high resolution. These data have allowed us to model a number of hydrogen atoms involved in the binding of the sugar to Con A, using the difference density map to place the hydrogen atoms. This map reveals the presence of the protonated form of Asp208 involved in binding. Asp208 is not protonated in the 0.94 A native structure. Our results clearly show that this residue is protonated and hydrogen bonds to the sugar. The structure accounts for the higher affinity of the alpha1-2 linked sugar when compared to other disaccharides. This structure identifies different interactions to those predicted by previous modelling studies. We believe that the additional data presented here will enable significant improvements to be made to the sugar-protein modelling algorithms.",

However, these rankings are difficult to interpret. It is essentially impossible to determine where novel active compounds might be found in database rankings. Thus, compound selection largely depends on intuition and guesswork. Herein, we show that molecular networks can substantially aid in the analysis of similarity-based compound rankings. A series of networks generated for rankings provides visual access to search results and adds chemical neighborhood and context information for reference compounds that are not available in rankings. Network structure is shown to serve as a diagnostic criterion for the likelihood to successfully select active compounds from rankings. In addition, comparison of different networks makes it possible to prioritize alternative similarity measures for search calculations and optimize the enrichment of active compounds in rankings.",

Cancer cells require and uptake a large amount of iron to proliferate. They are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of artemisinin than normal cells. Cancer cells express a large concentration of cell surface transferrin receptors that facilitate uptake of the plasma iron-carrying protein transferrin via endocytosis. By covalently tagging artemisinin to transferrin, artemisinin could be selectively picked up and concentrated by cancer cells. Futhermore, both artemisinin and iron would be transported into the cell in one package. Once an artemisinin-tagged transferrin molecule is endocytosed, iron is released and reacts with artemisinin moieties tagged to transferrin. Formation of free radicals kills the cancer cell. The authors have found that artemisinin-tagged transferrin is highly selective and potent in killing cancer cells. Thus, artemisinin and artemisinin-tagged iron-carrying compounds could be developed into powerful anticancer drugs.",

Each organ (leaf, stem, and capitulum) was separated from the branch and dried, and later analyzed for capillarisin and 6,7-dimethylesculetin content by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The capillarisin and 6,7-dimethylesculetin content reached maximum levels in the leaf just before the appearance of flower buds at end of July. About one month later, at the end of August during budding and flowering, capillarisin content in the capitulum reached a peak and then decreased. On the other hand, 6,7-dimethylescuretin content reached a maximum at the beginning of September, two weeks after the capillarisin maximum.

Structures and relative stereochemistry were determined using spectrometric techniques, particularly 1D and 2D NMR, and molecular modelling experiments. The compounds isolated appear to be enantiomeric to compounds with the same skeleton isolated from brown algae of the genus Cystoseira collected in northern Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. The isolation of tetraprenyltoluquinols with the amentol skeleton from this alga suggests that C. fibrosa should be moved from the genus Cystophora into the Cystoseira.",

An issue when designing molecules from a starting material is the combinatorial explosion of possible product molecules that can be generated, especially for multistep syntheses. Here, we present the development of RENATE, a reaction-based de novo design tool, which is based on a pseudo-retrosynthetic fragmentation of a reference ligand and an inside-out approach to de novo design. The reference ligand is fragmented; each fragment is used to search for similar fragments as building blocks; the building blocks are combined into products using reaction vectors; and a synthetic route is suggested for each product molecule. The RENATE methodology is presented followed by a retrospective validation to recreate a set of approved drugs. Results show that RENATE can generate very similar or even identical structures to the corresponding input drugs, hence validating the fragmentation, search, and design heuristics implemented in the tool.",

Samples from the different commercial brands were evaluated by the e-tongue and then followed by the e-nose. Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) separately on the respective e-tongue and e-nose data, only five distinct groups were projected. However, by employing a low level data fusion technique, six distinct groupings were achieved. Hence, this technique can enhance the ability of PCA to analyze the complex samples of Orthosiphon stamineus. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was then used to further validate and classify the samples.

MolHyb tries to generate novel ligands through hybridizing the seed compound with helper compounds that bind to the same protein target or similar proteins. To facilitate the job of getting helper compounds, we compiled a modeled protein-ligand structure database as an extension to crystal structures in the PDB database by placing the bioactive compounds in ChEMBL into their corresponding 3D protein binding pocket properly. MolHyb works by searching for helper compounds from the protein-ligand structure database and migrating chemical moieties from helper compounds to the seed compound efficiently. Hybridization is performed at both cyclic and acyclic bonds. The users can also input their own helper compounds to MolHyb. We hope that MolHyb will be a useful tool for rational drug design.

Experiments often require simple, easy and cheap methods to distinguish between individuals in a trial. A standard technique for this is CO2 anaesthesia and then labelling or wing clipping each fly. However, this is invasive and has been shown to affect behavior. Other techniques have used coloration to identify flies. This article presents a simple and non-invasive method for labelling Drosophila that allows them to be individually identified within experiments, using food coloring. This method is used in trials where two males compete to mate with a female. Dyeing allowed quick and easy identification. There was, however, some difference in the strength of the coloration across the three species tested. Data is presented showing the dye has a lower impact on mating behavior than CO2 in Drosophila melanogaster. The impact of CO2 anaesthesia is shown to depend on the species of Drosophila, with D. pseudoobscura and D. subobscura showing no impact, whereas D. melanogaster males had reduced mating success. The dye method presented is applicable to a wide range of experimental designs. ",

This study was done to evaluate the effects of Centella asiatica on the proliferation and migration of rabbit corneal epithelial (RCE) cells in the in vitro wound healing model. RCE cells were cultured with or without supplementation of Centella asiatica aqueous extract. Viability and proliferation of the RCE cells was determined by MTT assay and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. In vitro re-epithelization was studied by scratch assay and migration rate was evaluated quantitatively by image analyzer. Expression of corneal specific differentiation markers, CK12 and connexin 43, were studied via RT-PCR. It was found that supplementation of Centella asiatica did not show any significant effect on the RCE cells proliferation at the concentration up to 500ppm, while at the concentration of 1000ppm significantly inhibited RCE cells proliferation (p&lt;0.05). However, at the concentration up to 62.5ppm, RCE cells shows significant enhancement of migration rate compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05).

However, there are few studies on the effect of C. asiatica extracts on stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). To determine whether H(2) O(2) -induced senescence is affected by C. asiatica extracts, we performed senescence analysis on cultured human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). We also analysed whole gene expression level using microarrays and showed that 39 mRNAs are differentially expressed in H(2) O(2) -induced HDFs with and without treatment with C. asiatica extracts. These genes regulate apoptosis, gene silencing, cell growth, transcription, senescence, DNA replication and the spindle checkpoint. Differential expression of FOXM1, E2F2, MCM2, GDF15 and BHLHB2 was confirmed using semi-quantitative PCR. In addition, C. asiatica extracts rescued the H(2) O(2) -induced repression of replication in HDFs. Therefore, the findings presented here suggest that C. asiatica extracts might regulate SIPS by preventing repression of DNA replication and mitosis-related gene expression.",

Thousands of new triterpenoids with various skeletal modifications have now been synthesized. One of the most important modifications is the formation of a new heterocyclic ring. The simple fact that the vast majority of currently used drugs are heterocyclic compounds has encouraged a lot of researches to synthesize analogous triterpenoid derivatives in order to find new molecules with higher activities and consequently optimize their pharmacological profile. The biological properties of triterpenoid heterocycles are very promising and many of them have been studied, especially as antitumor agents. This review is mainly focused on the synthesis of various types of nitrogen and occasionally sulfur-containing heterocyclic triterpenoids for their potential use as future drugs in medicine and in addition discusses their overall biological activities.",

The aim of the method is to link two or more predetermined functional groups into a sensible molecular structure. The proposed designing process mimics the classical manual design method, in which the drug designer sits in front of the computer screen and with the aid of computer graphics attempts to design the new drug. Therefore, the key principle of the algorithm is the parameterization of some criteria that affect the decision-making process carried out by the drug designer. This parameterization is based on the generation of weighting factors that reflect the knowledge and knowledge-based intuition of the drug designer, and thus add further rationalization to the drug design process. The proposed algorithm has been shown to yield a large variety of different structures, of which the drug designer may choose the most sensible. Performance tests indicate that with the proper set of parameters, the method generates a new structure within a short time.",

The production of natural products in Streptomyces is controlled by the intricate regulation mechanisms. Manipulation of the regulatory systems that govern secondary metabolite production will strongly facilitate the discovery and development of natural products of Streptomyces origin.

The methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3THF) gives rise to the methyl group of the acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and the carbon monoxide (CO) and CoA to its carboxyl thio ester group. The role of ATP is unknown. One of the protein fractions (F2) is a methyltransferase, whereas the other fraction (F3) contains CO dehydrogenase and a methyl acceptor which is postulated to be a corrinoid enzyme. The methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group to the methyl acceptor, and the CO is converted to a formyl derivative by the CO dehydrogenase. By a mechanism that is as yet unknown, the formyl derivative in combination with CoA and the methyl of the methyl acceptor are converted to acetyl-CoA. It is also shown that fraction F3 catalyzes the reversible exchange of 14C from [1-14C]acetyl-CoA into 14CO and that ATP is required, but not the methyltransferase.

New findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptors exist on gut afferent neurones and that their activation by locally released 5-HT leads to visceral nociceptive stimulation, in addition to increased neuronally-mediated motor and secretory activity. If this concept is validated, it will provide a rationale for the use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in patients with increased gut motility, reduced fluid absorption and low nociceptive thresholds leading to abdominal pain. Alosetron is a highly selective, potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which is well absorbed with a long pharmacodynamic half-life.

Mosapride citrate is a selective serotonin 5- HT4 receptor agonist and enhances propulsive activity throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Mosapride citrate was orally administered to 11 patients with constipation-type irritable bowel syndrome to investigate its effect on this disease.

Studies involving healthy volunteers and IBS patients have demonstrated a beneficial effect of treatment with alosetron on global IBS symptoms, abdominal pain and discomfort, altered bowel function as well as improvement of quality of life (QOL). Data from animals studies suggest the involvement of 5-HT(3) receptors on intrinsic primary afferent neurons in the mediation of the effect of alosetron on gastrointestinal motility and secretion. While definitive proof of a visceroanalgesic action is not available, an additional central mechanism of action is suggested by findings obtained in animal models, as well as from human brain imaging studies. Alosetron shows a greater effectiveness in women, and the role of genetic factors underlying inter-individual differences in the response to alosetron is currently under investigation. The most frequent adverse event associated with the use of alosetron is constipation and in some rare cases, the development of colonic mucosal ischaemia. In the following review, the most recent reported effects of alosetron on gastrointestinal motility, visceral sensitivity and anxiety, both in terms of preclinical and clinical data will be discussed. The impact of alosetron on QOL in IBS patients and the safety of treatment with alosetron, will also be covered.",

Improvement in bowel movement frequency and consistency was achieved and pain was relieved by 1 week. During 12 weeks of treatment, alosetron was shown to elicit significant relief of abdominal pain and discomfort compared with placebo or mebeverine in female IBS patients with diarrhea. Alosetron slowed colonic transit and treatment efficacy was apparent after a week of treatment. Another 5-HT4 receptor agonist, prucalopride, which is being developed for chronic constipation, accelerates colonic transit and increases stool frequency.

IBS is a common multisymptom disorder that is associated with a high socioeconomic burden. The goal of treatment is to provide rapid and sustained global relief of the multiple symptoms of IBS with a single, effective, well-tolerated agent. Traditional treatment options target single symptoms, and many patients are dissatisfied with the level of relief achieved and adverse effects. Research has revealed that serotonin is involved in three major actions in the gut: (1) mediating intestinal motility, (2) mediating intestinal secretion in the GI tract, and (3) modulating perception in the bowels. Serotonin is also a vital link in the brain-gut axis. Alterations in key elements of serotonin signaling have been demonstrated in patients with IBS. Tegaserod, a selective serotonin type 4 (5-HT(4))-receptor partial agonist, is indicated for use in women with IBS whose primary bowel symptom is constipation. Alosetron, a 5-HT(3)-receptor antagonist, is indicated for use in women with severe diarrhea-predominant IBS in whom traditional therapies have failed. The clinical usefulness of several other serotonergic agents for IBS is being investigated. The use of serotonergic agents in patients with IBS is based on the critical role that serotonin plays in the maintenance of normal gut function and brain-gut communication. Pharmacologic therapies targeting specific serotonin receptors represent an important step in the management of IBS.",

The strategic locations of 5-HT and its receptors are described, the most dominant being the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 type. 5-HT, acting mostly at 5-HT3 or 5-HT3-like receptors, enhances the sensitivity of visceral neurones projecting between the gut and the central nervous systems. 5-HT, acting at 5-HT4 receptors promotes the sensitivity of enteric neurones that react to luminal stimuli. 5-HT4 and 5-HT3 receptors also mediate, respectively, sensitising and physiological actions of 5-HT on gastro-intestinal motor and secretory functions. This distribution implies that some 5-HT3 receptor antagonists might reduce certain symptoms of IBS, such as pain, by reducing the reactivity of the visceral afferent neurones linking the gut with the brain and spinal cord. However, such antagonists are not likely to find widespread clinical acceptance because they can also affect normal lower bowel function and promote constipation. 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, by contrast, reduce 5-HT-induced enteric nerve hypersensitivity without notably affecting the function of the normal bowel. Accordingly, these agents may reduce the symptoms of IBS directly, by reducing the incidence of defecation and diarrhoea and indirectly, by reducing both 'rebound' constipation and the post-prandial discomfort and pain associated with gastrointestinal hyper-reactivity.",

Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is a serotonin receptor type 3 antagonist approved in early 2000 for use in women with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). Initial use was widespread, but infrequent serious adverse events of ischemic colitis and severe constipation-related complications prompted alosetron's voluntary withdrawal from the US market in November 2000. Unprecedented public request prompted its reintroduction in 2002 under a Risk Management Plan, including a more restricted indication and a Prescribing Program for Lotronex. Despite these measures, the use of alosetron has been very limited since its reintroduction. Possible deterrents to its use include concerns over safety and the possible medical-legal implications raised by the Risk Management Plan. It is also possible that changes in the natural history and/or diagnosis of IBS-D have reduced the target population. Given the unique regulatory history of alosetron, these issues continue to engender controversy. This article profiles these concerns and reviews the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety, and post-marketing experience with alosetron. Myths and misconceptions related to alosetron use, or lack thereof, are addressed to provide the reader with the evidence needed to make informed treatment decisions for their female patients with severe IBS-D.",

Oral administration of purified sennosides (25, 40 and 64 mg/kg) dose-dependently reversed net fluid absorption to net fluid secretion, enhanced the incidence of diarrhea and stimulated the release of 5-HT into the colonic lumen from 7.1 to 17.3 ng/g wet weight. The 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin and the 5-HT3 antagonist tropisetron dose-dependently but only partially reduced sennoside (40 mg/kg)-induced fluid secretion whereas the 5-HT3 antagonist granisetron dose-dependently reduced and at 300 micrograms/kg totally abolished sennoside-induced secretion. Granisetron, but not ketanserin and tropisetron, reduced the incidence of diarrhea in sennoside-treated rats, indicating the involvement of 5-HT also in acceleration of large intestinal transit. It is concluded that 5-HT is an important mediator both of sennoside-induced fluid secretion in the rat colon and of diarrhea.",

Although there is no specific biological marker for the diagnosis of this disorder, recently developed symptom-based criteria provide the tools necessary to make a diagnosis. The precise underlying pathophysiology of IBS remains unknown. However, disturbances in the brain-gut axis involving the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system have emerged as an underlying concept for IBS. In this regard, conventional treatment has been recognised as unsatisfactory for many patients with IBS and novel, neuroenteric modulatory compounds have been introduced for use by clinicians. Specifically, compounds interacting with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) receptors of the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 subtype have been demonstrated of benefit in some patients for the treatment of IBS. In this leading article, we present the current data on the pharmacology, clinical trials, indications and adverse effects of alosetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3 antagonist. As a result of the recognition of serious adverse effects, the indication for alosetron has been restricted and it is now indicated only for women with severe diarrhoea-predominant IBS who have symptoms for at least 6 months and who have failed to respond to conventional therapy. Prescribing restrictions and the risk-management programme implemented as required by the US FDA is reviewed along with a summary of the studies to be performed after reintroduction of alosetron to monitor safety.",

To investigate the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptors in this sensory component of the gastrocolonic response in irritable bowel syndrome. Fifteen female patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome completed a trial with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist alosetron (1 mg b.d.) or placebo (b.d.) over 15 days, followed by the alternative treatment. Each treatment period was followed by a colonic distension trial before and after duodenal lipids. Changes in colonic thresholds, tone and compliance and viscerosomatic referral pattern after lipids were compared between treatments. With placebo, the colonic thresholds after lipids were significantly reduced for all studied sensations, whereas, with alosetron, the thresholds were significantly reduced only for first sensation and discomfort, but not for gas and pain. The reductions in thresholds did not differ significantly between treatments, but the pain threshold after alosetron tended to be less reduced compared with placebo (P = 0.10). The effects of lipids on tone, compliance and viscerosomatic referral pattern were unaffected by alosetron relative to placebo. 5-HT3 receptor antagonism reduces the lipid-induced colonic hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome. However, 5-HT3 receptors do not seem to be the principal mediator, but may be a cofactor for the exaggerated sensory component of the gastrocolonic response in irritable bowel syndrome.",

It has a prominent role in the regulation of motility, vascular tone, secretion and perception both in normal and under certain pathophysiological conditions, such as the carcinoid syndrome and the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Serotonin is known to markedly influence bowel function by activating at least five receptor types (5-HT(1,2,3,4,7)). Among all 5-HT receptors, those belonging to the 5-HT3 (a ionotropic receptor) and 5-HT4 (a metabotropic receptor) type are the most extensively studied in gastroenterology, resulting in commercially available (although not worldwide) serotonergic agents for the treatment of IBS and functional dyspepsia. Recently, 5-HT7 receptors have been found to participate in the accommodation process of the circular muscle during the preparatory phase of ileal peristalsis.

Recently, many selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonists including tropisetron, zacopride, ondansetron, granisetron, zatosetron, nazasetron, YM060 and YM114 (KAE-393) have been developed. Many actions attributable to the 5-HT3-receptor have been described in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, and clinical trials are already showing the potential use of these 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in a number of disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, such as nausea and vomiting induced by cancer chemotherapy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and migraine. In addition, endogenous 5-HT is suggested to be one of the substances that mediate stress-induced responses in gastrointestinal function, i.e., increase in fecal pellet output and diarrhea. Moreover, YM060, YM114 (KAE-393) and granisetron have been reported to inhibit restraint stress- and 5-HT-induced increases in fecal pellet output and diarrhea in rats and mice, indicating that endogenous 5-HT may mediate stress-induced changes in bowel function through the 5-HT3 receptor.

Their main function is to regulate DNA replication and DNA damage response.

CHK1/CHK2 plays a crucial role in the repair of recombination-mediated double-stranded DNA breaks. The other important functions performed by these proteins are the beginning of DNA replication, the stabilization of replication forks, the resolution of replication stress and the coordination of mitosis, even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Prexasertib (LY2606368) is a small ATP-competitive selective inhibitor of CHK1 and CHK2. In preclinical studies, prexasertib in monotherapy has shown to induce DNA damage and tumor cells apoptosis. The preclinical data and early clinical studies advocate the use of prexasertib in solid tumors both in monotherapy and in combination with other drugs (antimetabolites, PARP inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy).

Cell cycle checkpoints are involved in the response to DNA damage and specifically prevent cell cycle progression to allow DNA repair. Tumor cells can take advantage of the G2 checkpoint to arrest following DNA damage and avoid immediate cell death. This can contribute to acquisition of drug resistance. By abrogating the G2 checkpoint arrest, it may be possible to synergistically augment tumor cell death induced by DNA damage and circumvent resistance. This requires an understanding of the molecules involved in regulating the checkpoints. Human Chk1 is a recently identified homologue of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe checkpoint kinase gene, which is required for G2 arrest in response to DNA damage. Chk1 phosphorylates the dual specificity phosphatase cdc25C on Ser-216, and this may be involved in preventing cdc25 from activating cdc2/cyclinB and initiating mitosis. To further study the role of Chk1 in G2 checkpoint control, we identified a potent and selective indolocarbazole inhibitor (SB-218078) of Chk1 kinase activity and used this compound to assess cell cycle checkpoint responses. Limited DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation or the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan was used to induce G2 arrest in HeLa cells. In the presence of the Chk1 inhibitor, the cells did not arrest following gamma-irradiation or treatment with topotecan, but continued into mitosis.

Prexasertib caused increased DNA damage and cell death in vitro and significant tumor regression and improved survival in vivo. The gene expression and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) analyses of the in vivo tumors demonstrated increased expression of genes that are related to T-cell activation and increased immune cell trafficking, and decreased expression of genes that related to immunosuppression. However, increased expression of genes related to immunosuppression emerged over time suggesting evasion of immune surveillances. These findings in gene expression analyses were confirmed using mIHC which showed differential modulation of TIME in the tumor margins and as well as cores over time. These results suggest that evasion of immune surveillance, at least in part, may contribute to the acquired resistance to prexasertib in HNSCC.",

Many conventional agents used to treat cancer impart damage to the genome and activate cell cycle checkpoints. Many tumors are defective in the tumor suppressor p53 and therefore lack a functional G(1) checkpoint. In these tumors, however, the S-G(2) checkpoints remain intact and, in response to DNA damage, arrest cell cycle progression allowing time for DNA repair. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a key element in the DNA damage response pathway and plays a crucial role in the S-G(2)-phase checkpoints. Inhibiting Chk1 represents a therapeutic strategy for creating a \"synthetic lethal\" response by overriding the last checkpoint defense of tumor cells against the lethal damage induced by DNA-directed chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1 inhibition is consistent with emerging targeted therapies aiming to exploit molecular differences between normal and cancer cells. Adding a Chk1 inhibitor to DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy selectively targets tumors with intrinsic checkpoint defects while minimizing toxicity in checkpoint-competent normal cells. PF-00477736 was identified as a potent, selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor that inhibits Chk1 with a K(i) of 0.49 nM. PF-00477736 abrogates cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and enhances cytotoxicity of clinically important chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine and carboplatin. In xenografts, PF-00477736 enhanced the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in a dose-dependent manner. PF-00477736 combinations were well tolerated with no exacerbation of side effects commonly associated with cytotoxic agents.",

Significant progress has been made recently toward our understanding of Chk1 regulation and its implications in cancer etiology and therapy. Specifically, a model that involves both spatiotemporal and conformational changes of proteins has been proposed for Chk1 activation. Further, emerging evidence suggests that Chk1 does not appear to be a tumor suppressor; instead, it promotes tumor growth and may contribute to anticancer therapy resistance.

Knockdown of CHK1 and/or CHK2 by siRNA verified that the double-strand DNA breaks and cell death elicited by prexasertib were due to specific CHK1 inhibition. Neuroblastoma xenografts rapidly regressed following prexasertib administration, independent of starting tumor volume.

In human tumor cell lines, ablation of CHK1 function during antimetabolite exposure led to accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks and cell death. Here, we extend these observations and confirm ablation of CHK2 does not contribute to these phenotypes and may diminish them. Furthermore, concomitant suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is sufficient to completely antagonize the desired CHK1 ablation phenotypes. These mechanism-based observations prompted the development of a high-content, cell-based screen for γ-H2AX induction, a surrogate marker for double-strand DNA breaks.

However, the mode of inhibition differs from that of the previously studied structure of Chk2 in complex with debromohymenialdisine, a compound that inhibits both Chk1 and Chk2. A unique hydrophobic pocket in Chk2, located very close to the bound inhibitor, presents an opportunity for the rational design of compounds with higher binding affinity and greater selectivity.",

Many chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation induce not only apoptotic signaling pathways, but also survival responses such as DNA damage responses and cell cycle arrest, which allow for DNA repair. These survival responses determine the toxicity as well as the efficacy of the cancer treatment. Two main DNA damage responses include the activation of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-kappaB and the activation of cell cycle checkpoint kinases. Strategies of combining chemotherapeutics with (a) inhibitors of NF-kappaB or (b) inhibitors of checkpoint kinases, may therefore enhance the efficacy of current cancer therapies. This review will be focused on recent progress made in combining traditional chemotherapeutic drugs with small molecule inhibitors of NF-kappaB and the checkpoint kinases, Chk1 and Chk2.",

Therefore, we have recently developed new preclinical models to study promising novel agents for the treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma. The checkpoint kinase (chk) inhibitor prexasertib (LY2606368) and its salt form (LSN2940930) have recently been shown to be active in adult and pediatric malignancies, including sarcoma. We have now tested the potency of prexasertib in clonogenic survival assays in two new lines of primary patient-derived osteosarcoma cells and in two established osteosarcoma cell lines as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin and the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor talazoparib. Prexasertib alone results in strongly reduced clonogenic survival at low nanomolar concentrations and acts by affecting cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis and induction of double-stranded DNA breakage at concentrations that are well below clinically tolerable and safe plasma concentrations. In combination with cisplatin and talazoparib, prexasertib acts in a synergistic fashion. Chk1 inhibition by prexasertib and its combination with the DNA damaging agent cisplatin and the PARP-inhibitor talazoparib thus emerges as a potential new treatment option for pediatric osteosarcoma which will now have to be tested in preclinical primary patient derived in vivo models and clinical studies.",

Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which is activated by DNA damage and replication stress, diminishes sensitivity to cytarabine and anthracyclines as single agents, suggesting that CHK1 inhibitors might increase the effectiveness of CPX-351. The present studies show that CPX-351 activates CHK1 as well as the S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints. Conversely, CHK1 inhibition diminishes the cell cycle effects of CPX-351. Moreover, CHK1 knockdown or addition of a CHK1 inhibitor such as MK-8776, rabusertib or prexasertib enhances CPX-351-induced apoptosis in multiple TP53-null and TP53-wildtype AML cell lines. Likewise, CHK1 inhibition increases the antiproliferative effect of CPX-351 on primary AML specimens ex vivo, offering the possibility that CPX-351 may be well suited to combine with CHK1-targeted agents.",

This degradation was independent of the Thr68 phosphorylation, ATM kinase, and BRCA1 tumor suppressor. Examination of Chk2 protein revealed a decreased expression of Chk2 protein in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, suggesting that degradation or decreased expression of Chk2 is partially responsible for chemo-resistance. Site-directed mutation of the putative destruction box in the Chk2 protein did not affect the Chk2 degradation induced by cisplatin.

To minimize the detrimental effects of bulky adducts and other DNA lesions, S-phase checkpoint mechanisms sense DNA damage and integrate DNA repair with ongoing DNA replication. The essential protein kinase Chk1 mediates the S-phase checkpoint, inhibiting initiation of new DNA synthesis and promoting stabilization and recovery of stalled replication forks. Here we review the mechanisms by which Chk1 is activated in response to bulky adducts and potential mechanisms by which Chk1 signaling inhibits the initiation stage of DNA synthesis. Additionally, we discuss mechanisms by which Chk1 signaling facilitates bypass of bulky lesions by specialized Y-family DNA polymerases, thereby attenuating checkpoint signaling and allowing resumption of normal cell cycle progression.",

As the cell cycle checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) plays a key role in DNA damage response to chemotherapeutic drugs, we explored the mechanisms of acquired drug resistance to the Chk1 inhibitor prexasertib in SCLC. We established prexasertib resistance in two SCLC cell lines and found that DNA copy number, messengerRNA (mRNA) and protein levels of the cell cycle regulator Wee1 significantly correlate with the level of acquired resistance. Wee1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Wee1 inhibitor reversed prexasertib resistance, whereas Wee1 transfection induced prexasertib resistance in parental cells. Reverse phase protein microarray identified up-regulated proteins in the resistant cell lines that are involved in apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell cycle. Down-regulation of CDK1 and CDC25C kinases promoted acquired resistance in parental cells, whereas down-regulation of p38MAPK reversed the resistance. High Wee1 expression was significantly correlated with better prognosis of resected SCLC patients. Our results indicate that Wee1 overexpression plays an important role in acquired resistance to Chk1 inhibition. We also show that bypass activation of the p38MAPK signaling pathway may contribute to acquired resistance to Chk1 inhibition. The combination of Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of SCLC.",

Expression of a dominant-negative Chk2 mutant blocks induction of E2F-1 and prevents E2F-1-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, E2F-1 is resistant to induction by etoposide in tumour cells expressing mutant chk2. Therefore, Chk2 phosphorylates and activates E2F-1 in response to DNA damage, resulting in apoptosis.

In this study, the transcriptome sequencing of leaf tissues in R. sativus was performed for the first time. Approximately 22 million clean reads were generated and used for transcriptome assembly. The generated unigenes were subsequently annotated against gene ontology (GO) database. KEGG analysis further revealed two important pathways in the bolting stage of R.sativus including spliceosome assembly and alkaloid synthesis. In addition, a total of 6,295 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with various motifs were identified in the unigene library of R. sativus. Finally, four unigenes of R. sativus were selected for alignment with their homologs from other plants, and phylogenetic trees for each of the genes were constructed. Taken together, this study will provide a platform to facilitate gene discovery and advance functional genomic research of R. sativus. ",

A total of 236 marker loci were assayed in these populations using a set of 144 informative Brassica RFLP probes previously used for genetic mapping in other crucifer species. The genetic maps derived from the BC1 and F2 populations were perfectly collinear and were integrated to produce a robust Raphanus map. Cytological observations demonstrated strict bivalent pairing in the R. sativus x R. raphanistrum hybrids. Productive pairing along the length of each chromosome was confirmed by the identification of nine extensive linkage groups and the lack of clustering of marker loci. Indeed, the distributions of both marker loci and crossovers was more random than those reported for other crop species. The genetic markers and the reference map of Raphanus will be of considerable value for future trait mapping and marker-assisted breeding in this crop, as well as in the intergenomic transfer of Raphanus genes into Brassica crops.

To describe these changes chemically, radish was cultivated and harvested at different time points, followed by detailed chemical analysis of insoluble fiber polysaccharides and lignin. During maturation, changes in polysaccharide profiles were observed, with a decrease in the portion of neutral pectic side chains and an increase in the xylan portion being predominant.

The map was constructed based on genotyping by whole-genome resequencing of mapping parents and F 2 population. Raphanus sativus is an annual vegetable crop species of the Brassicaceae family and is one of the key plants in the seed industry, especially in East Asia. Assessment of the R. sativus genome provides fundamental resources for crop improvement as well as the study of crop genome structure and evolution. With the goal of anchoring genome sequence assemblies of R. sativus cv. WK10039 whose genome has been sequenced onto the chromosomes, we developed a reference genetic map based on genotyping of two parents (maternal WK10039 and paternal WK10024) and 93 individuals of the F2 mapping population by whole-genome resequencing. To develop high-confidence genetic markers, ~83 Gb of parental lines and ~591 Gb of mapping population data were generated as Illumina 100 bp paired-end reads. High stringent sequence analysis of the reads mapped to the 344 Mb of genome sequence scaffolds identified a total of 16,282 SNPs and 150 PCR-based markers. Using a subset of the markers, a high-density genetic map was constructed from the analysis of 2,637 markers spanning 1,538 cM with 1,000 unique framework loci. The genetic markers integrated 295 Mb of genome sequences to the cytogenetically defined chromosome arms. Comparative analysis of the chromosome-anchored sequences with Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa revealed that the R. sativus genome has evident triplicated sub-genome blocks and the structure of gene space is highly similar to that of B. rapa. The genetic map developed in this study will serve as fundamental genomic resources for the study of R. sativus.",

Flowering is necessary for plant propagation, but it is also an important agronomic trait influencing R. sativus fleshy taproot yield and quality in the case of an imbalance between vegetative and reproductive growth. There is currently a lack of detailed information regarding the pathways regulating the flowering genes or their evolution in R. sativus. The release of the R. sativus genome sequence provides an opportunity to identify and characterize the flowering genes using a comparative genomics approach. We identified 254 R. sativus flowering genes based on sequence similarities and analyses of syntenic regions. The genes were unevenly distributed on the various chromosomes. Furthermore, we discovered the existence of R. sativus core function genes in the flowering regulatory network, which revealed that basic flowering pathways are relatively conserved between Arabidopsis thaliana and R. sativus. Additional comparisons with Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa indicated that the retained flowering genes differed among species after genome triplication events. The R. sativus flowering genes were preferentially retained, especially those associated with gibberellin signaling and metabolism. Moreover, analyses of selection pressures suggested that the genes in vernalization and autonomous pathways were more variable than the genes in other R. sativus flowering pathways. Our results revealed that the core flowering genes are conserved between R. sativus and A. thaliana to a certain extent. Moreover, the copy number variation and functional differentiation of the homologous genes in R. sativus increased the complexity of the flowering regulatory networks after genome polyploidization. Our study provides an integrated framework for the R. sativus flowering pathways and insights into the evolutionary relationships between R. sativus flowering genes and the genes from A. thaliana and close relatives.",

To promote more genetic and genomic studies and to enhance breeding programmes of R. sativus, we have prepared genetic resources such as complementary DNA libraries, expressed sequences tags (ESTs), simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and a genetic linkage map. A total of 26 606 ESTs have been collected from seedlings, roots, leaves, and flowers, and clustered into 10 381 unigenes. Similarities were observed between the expression patterns of transcripts from R. sativus and those from representative members of the genera Arabidopsis and Brassica, indicating their functional relatedness. The EST sequence data were used to design 3800 SSR markers and consequently 630 polymorphic SSR loci and 213 reported marker loci have been mapped onto nine linkage groups, covering 1129.2 cM with an average distance of 1.3 cM between loci. Comparison of the mapped EST-SSR marker positions in R. sativus with the genome sequence of A. thaliana indicated that the Brassicaceae members have evolved from a common ancestor. It appears that genomic fragments corresponding to those of A. thaliana have been doubled and tripled in R. sativus. The genetic map developed here is expected to provide a standard map for the genetics, genomics, and molecular breeding of R. sativus as well as of related species.
