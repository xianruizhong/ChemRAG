For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades.

I report, here, the status quo theories for olfaction, highlighting what we do not know, and explaining why dismissing the perception of the input as 'too subjective' acts as a roadblock not conducive to scientific inquiry. I outline the current and new theory that conjectures a mechanism for signal transduction based on quantum mechanical phenomena, dubbed the 'swipe card', which is perhaps controversial but feasible. I show that such lines of thinking may answer some questions, or at least pose the right questions. Most importantly, I draw links and comparisons as to how better understanding of how small (10's of atoms) molecules can interact so specially with large (10,000's of atoms) proteins in a way that is so integral to healthy living. Repercussions of this work are not just important in understanding a basic scientific tool used by us all, but often taken for granted, it is also a step closer to understanding generic mechanisms between drug and receptor, for example.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Even after accepting that some signals are reliable because of their strategic costs, he argued for a pluralistic approach to signal reliability. Signal complexity was a developing interest when he died. Signals usually involve several components, some of which appear to amplify other signal components.

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair. Additionally, yaInChI better preserves the original information of the given input file (SDF) using the protonation information, hydrogen count +1, and original bond type, which are not considered or restrictively considered in InChI and SMILES.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database. Average similarities (LINGOsim) were 0.07 for the random pairs and 0.36 for the bioisosteric pairs.",

Maniq, a language spoken by a small population of nomadic hunter-gatherers in southern Thailand, is such a language. It has a lexicon of over a dozen terms dedicated to smell. We examined the semantics of these smell terms in 3 experiments (exemplar listing, similarity judgment and off-line rating). The exemplar listing task confirmed that Maniq smell terms have complex meanings encoding smell qualities. Analyses of the similarity data revealed that the odor lexicon is coherently structured by two dimensions. The underlying dimensions are pleasantness and dangerousness, as verified by the off-line rating study. Ethnographic data illustrate that smell terms have detailed semantics tapping into broader cultural constructs. Contrary to the widespread view that languages cannot encode odors, the Maniq data show odor can be a coherent semantic domain, thus shedding new light on the limits of language. ",

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The properties ascribed to the alkahest fit perfectly within Helmontian theories about matter, disease, and cure.",

Until the mid-nineteenth century nature's pharmaceuticals were all that were available to relieve man's pain and suffering. The first synthetic drug, chloral hydrate, was discovered in 1869 and introduced as a sedative-hypnotic; it is still available today in some countries. The first pharmaceutical companies were spin-offs from the textiles and synthetic dye industry and owe much to the rich source of organic chemicals derived from the distillation of coal (coal-tar). The first analgesics and antipyretics, exemplified by phenacetin and acetanilide, were simple chemical derivatives of aniline and p-nitrophenol, both of which were byproducts from coal-tar. An extract from the bark of the white willow tree had been used for centuries to treat various fevers and inflammation. The active principle in white willow, salicin or salicylic acid, had a bitter taste and irritated the gastric mucosa, but a simple chemical modification was much more palatable. This was acetylsalicylic acid, better known as Aspirin®, the first blockbuster drug.

The synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activities against bacterial and fungal strains, and their characteristics were investigated by assays under various temperature and pH conditions.

Similarly, agents such as lauric acid 6 and parabens 7a-b, which are used as preservative agents for commercial cosmetics and detergents, were assayed for comparison.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

This effort will result in several hundred thousand additional chemical structures, along with their names, being available for online searching in the Registry File. Both the newly registered substances and those already on file are being linked to their pre-1965 citations in Chemical Abstracts in a new file called CAOLD. In this effort the printed Formula Index entries are converted to computer-readable form by using optical character recognition with the data subsequently processed with existing computer programs.",

While this is true for English, and other related languages, data from some non-Western languages challenge this view. Maniq, a language spoken by a small population of nomadic hunter-gatherers in southern Thailand, is such a language. It has a lexicon of over a dozen terms dedicated to smell. We examined the semantics of these smell terms in 3 experiments (exemplar listing, similarity judgment and off-line rating). The exemplar listing task confirmed that Maniq smell terms have complex meanings encoding smell qualities. Analyses of the similarity data revealed that the odor lexicon is coherently structured by two dimensions. The underlying dimensions are pleasantness and dangerousness, as verified by the off-line rating study. Ethnographic data illustrate that smell terms have detailed semantics tapping into broader cultural constructs. Contrary to the widespread view that languages cannot encode odors, the Maniq data show odor can be a coherent semantic domain, thus shedding new light on the limits of language. ",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

During the 1880s, the French chemist Charles Friedel organised the nomenclature reform effort that culminated in the Geneva Congress; in the disorderly nomenclature of German synthetic chemistry, Friedel saw an opportunity to advance French national interests and his own pedagogical goals. Friedel and a group of close colleagues reconceived nomenclature as a unified field, in which all chemical names ought to relate clearly to one another and to the structure of the compounds they represented. The German chemist Adolf von Baeyer went a step farther, arguing for names that precisely and uniquely corresponded to the structural formula of each compound, tailored for use in chemical dictionaries and handbooks. Baeyer's vision prevailed at the Geneva Congress, which consequently codified rules for rigorously mapping structural formulas into names, resulting in names that faithfully represented the features of these diagrams but not always the chemical behaviour of the compounds themselves. This approach ultimately limited both the number of chemical compounds that the Geneva rules were able to encompass and the breadth of their application. However, the relationship between diagram and name established at the Geneva Congress became the foundation not only of subsequent systems of chemical nomenclature but of methods of organising information that have supported the modern chemical sciences.",

When individual data contributors submit chemical substance descriptions to Substance, the unique chemical structures are extracted and stored into Compound through an automated process called structure standardization. The present study describes the PubChem standardization approaches and analyzes them for their success rates, reasons that cause structures to be rejected, and modifications applied to structures during the standardization process. Furthermore, the PubChem standardization is compared to the structure normalization of the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) software, as manifested by conversion of the InChI back into a chemical structure. The observed rejection rate for substances processed by PubChem standardization was 0.36%, which is predominantly attributed to structures with invalid atom valences that cannot be readily corrected without additional information from contributors. Of all structures that pass standardization, 44% are modified in the process, reducing the count of unique structures from 53,574,724 in substance to 45,808,881 in compound as identified by de-aromatized canonical isomeric SMILES. Even though the processing time is very low on average (only 0.4% of structures have individual standardization time above 0.1 s), total standardization time is completely dominated by edge cases: 90% of the time to standardize all structures in PubChem substance is spent on the 2.05% of structures with the highest individual standardization time. It is worth noting that 60% of the structures obtained from PubChem structure standardization are not identical to the chemical structure resulting from the InChI (primarily due to preferences for a different tautomeric form). Standardization of chemical structures is complicated by the diversity of chemical information and their representations approaches. The PubChem standardization is an effective and efficient tool to account for molecular diversity and to eliminate invalid/incomplete structures. Further development will concentrate on improved tautomer consideration and an expanded stereocenter definition. Modifications are difficult to thoroughly validate, with slight changes often affecting many thousands of structures and various edge cases.

In this article, the ongoing work to describe the chemical connectivity of entries contained in the Crystallography Open Database (COD) in SMILES format is reported. This collection of SMILES is publicly available for chemical (substructure) search or for any other purpose on an open-access basis, as is the COD itself. The conventions that have been followed for the representation of compounds that do not fit into the valence bond theory are outlined for the most frequently found cases. The procedure for getting the SMILES out of the CIF files starts with checking whether the atoms in the asymmetric unit are a chemically acceptable image of the compound. When they are not (molecule in a symmetry element, disorder, polymeric species,etc.), the previously published cif_molecule program is used to get such image in many cases. The program package Open Babel is then applied to get SMILES strings from the CIF files (either those directly taken from the COD or those produced by cif_molecule when applicable). The results are then checked and/or fixed by a human editor, in a computer-aided task that at present still consumes a great deal of human time. Even if the procedure still needs to be improved to make it more automatic (and hence faster), it has already yielded more than 160,000 curated chemical structures and the purpose of this article is to announce the existence of this work to the chemical community as well as to spread the use of its results.",

Onychine and its analogs exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antimalarial. Because of the high bioactivity of some 4-azafluorenone derivatives, several synthetic methods have been developed for their procurement. Considering the importance of these alkaloids, we aim to present the main synthetic approaches to onychines and its derivatives and the biological activity of some 4-azafluorenones. The most prominent methodologies for the synthesis of onychines were reviewed. In this work, we cover many synthetic approaches for the synthesis of onychine and 4-azafluorenone derivatives including intramolecular cyclizations, multicomponent reactions, microwave-assisted multicomponent reactions, Diels-alder reactions, among others. Moreover, we also review the biological activity of 4-azafluorenones. 4-azafluorenones have risen as prominent structures in medicinal chemistry; however, most of the time, access to new derivatives involves toxic catalysts, harsh reaction conditions, and long-step procedures. Therefore, the development of new synthetic routes with more operational simplicity, simple purification procedure, good yields, and low environmental impact, is desirable.",

Ernest Fourneau (1872-1949) and the transformation of the field of medicinal chemistry in France].\nThe synthetic local anaesthetic Stovaine was commercialised in France in 1904. Its inventor, Ernest Fourneau, began his career as a pharmaceutical chemist in organic chemistry laboratories in Germany, where from 1899 to 1901 he discovered how basic research could benefit from the modern chemistry theories which had developed in Germany starting in the 1860s. Using the complex structure of cocaine, he invented an original molecule, with comparable activity, but less toxic. The knowledge and the know-how which he acquired in Germany nourished his reflection in the field of the chemistry of the relationships between structure and activity, and led him to the development of Stovaïne. Emile Roux, Director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was interested in his work and invited him to head the first French therapeutic chemistry laboratory, in which research on medicinal chemistry was organised scientifically. The industrial development of new medicines resulting from the Pasteur Institute's therapeutic chemistry laboratory was supported by the Etablissements Poulenc frères, France thus gaining international reputation in the domain of pharmaceutical chemistry.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Mathematical modeling uncovers the appearance of the smiles, and both human and Bayesian classifiers validate these distinctions. New findings link laughter to reward, affiliation, and dominance, and research suggests that these functions of smiles are recognized across cultures.

We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database.

Dynamic characteristics included duration, onset and offset velocity, asymmetry of velocity, and head movements. Smile characteristics were measured using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman, Friesen, &amp; Hager, 2002) and Automated Facial Image Analysis (Cohn &amp; Kanade, 2007).

In comparison with perceived embarrassed/nervous, perceived amused more often included AU 6, lower maximum offset velocity, and smaller forward head pitch. In comparison with perceived polite, perceived embarrassed more often included mouth opening and smile controls, larger amplitude, and greater forward head pitch.

This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units.

Experimentally measuring the BDE value of HVIs is difficult, however, and the value has been estimated by quantum calculations, especially density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Although DFT calculations can access the BDE value with high accuracy, the process is highly time-consuming. Thus, we aimed to reduce the time for predicting the BDE by applying machine learning. We calculated the BDE of more than 1000 HVIs using DFT calculations, and performed machine learning. Converting SMILES strings to Avalon fingerprints and learning using a traditional Elastic Net made it possible to predict the BDE value with high accuracy. Furthermore, an applicability domain search revealed that the learning model could accurately predict the BDE even for uncovered inputs that were not completely included in the training data.",

Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts.

In the second step, machine learning techniques are applied to obtain a predictive model. The result is often not only a highly accurate but also hard to interpret model. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel SAR algorithm, SMIREP, which tightly integrates the fragment and model generation steps and which yields simple models in the form of a small set of IF-THEN rules. These rules contain SMILES fragments, which are easy to understand to the computational chemist. SMIREP combines ideas from the well-known IREP rule learner with a novel fragmentation algorithm for SMILES strings. SMIREP has been evaluated on three problems: the prediction of binding activities for the estrogen receptor (Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) National Center for Toxicological Research estrogen receptor (NCTRER) Database), the prediction of mutagenicity using the carcinogenic potency database (CPDB), and the prediction of biodegradability on a subset of the Environmental Fate Database (EFDB).

Applying CII gives the better statistical quality of models for toxicity Nano-mixtures towards Daphnia Magna. The statistical quality of the best model follows the determination coefficients 0.987 (training set) and 0.980 (validation set).",

This collection of SMILES is publicly available for chemical (substructure) search or for any other purpose on an open-access basis, as is the COD itself. The conventions that have been followed for the representation of compounds that do not fit into the valence bond theory are outlined for the most frequently found cases. The procedure for getting the SMILES out of the CIF files starts with checking whether the atoms in the asymmetric unit are a chemically acceptable image of the compound. When they are not (molecule in a symmetry element, disorder, polymeric species,etc.), the previously published cif_molecule program is used to get such image in many cases. The program package Open Babel is then applied to get SMILES strings from the CIF files (either those directly taken from the COD or those produced by cif_molecule when applicable). The results are then checked and/or fixed by a human editor, in a computer-aided task that at present still consumes a great deal of human time. Even if the procedure still needs to be improved to make it more automatic (and hence faster), it has already yielded more than 160,000 curated chemical structures and the purpose of this article is to announce the existence of this work to the chemical community as well as to spread the use of its results.",

Instead, I have taken up and extended an old idea (Dyson, 1938) according to which vertebrate olfactory receptors detect odorants by their molecular vibrations. I propose that the detection mechanism is inelastic electron tunnelling. If this is correct, there should be a correlation between the tunnelling vibrational spectra of odorants and their odor character. Here, using semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods and a simple calculation method for tunnelling mode intensities, I calculate the spectra of structurally diverse odorants belonging to various odor categories. With few exceptions, the calculated spectra of bitter almonds, musks, ambers, woods, sandalwoods and violets strongly correlate with odor character.",

This is especially problematic at higher levels of processing, where complex cues elicit highly specific responses. In olfaction, this relationship is particularly obfuscated by the difficulty of characterizing stimulus statistics and perception. The core questions in olfaction are hence the so-called stimulus problem, which refers to the understanding of the stimulus, and the structure-activity and structure-odor relationships, which refer to the molecular basis of smell. It is widely accepted that the recognition of odorants by receptors is governed by the detection of physico-chemical properties and that the physical space is highly complex. Not surprisingly, ideas differ about how odor stimuli should be classified and about the very nature of information that the brain extracts from odors. Even though there are many measures for smell, there is none that accurately describes all aspects of it. Here, we summarize recent developments in the understanding of olfaction. We argue that an approach to olfactory function where information processing is emphasized could contribute to a high degree to our understanding of smell as a perceptual phenomenon emerging from neural computations. Further, we argue that combined analysis of the stimulus, biology, physiology, and behavior and perception can provide new insights into olfactory function. We hope that the reader can use this review as a competent guide and overview of research activities in olfactory physiology, psychophysics, computation, and psychology. We propose avenues for research, particularly in the systematic characterization of receptive fields and of perception. ",

Compared with the mainstream descriptor- and graph-based methods for molecular property predictions, SMILES-based methods can directly extract molecular features from SMILES without human expert knowledge, but they require more powerful algorithms for feature extraction and a larger amount of data for training, which makes SMILES-based methods less popular. Here, we show the great potential of pre-training in promoting the predictions of important pharmaceutical properties. By utilizing three pre-training tasks based on atom feature prediction, molecular feature prediction and contrastive learning, a new pre-training method K-BERT, which can extract chemical information from SMILES like chemists, was developed. The calculation results on 15 pharmaceutical datasets show that K-BERT outperforms well-established descriptor-based (XGBoost) and graph-based (Attentive FP and HRGCN+) models. In addition, we found that the contrastive learning pre-training task enables K-BERT to 'understand' SMILES not limited to canonical SMILES. Moreover, the general fingerprints K-BERT-FP generated by K-BERT exhibit comparative predictive power to MACCS on 15 pharmaceutical datasets and can also capture molecular size and chirality information that traditional binary fingerprints cannot capture. Our results illustrate the great potential of K-BERT in the practical applications of molecular property predictions in drug discovery.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Gilbert explores the sudden emergence of happiness as a discipline, reviews the major findings (including the mistakes we all make in predicting how happy or miserable we'll be), and examines the role of happiness in productivity on the job. He describes what makes us truly happy-it's not a promotion or a new house-and sketches out a \"happiness diet\" that emphasizes small, routine efforts. Looking forward, Gilbert discusses the breakthrough work of his colleague Matthew Killingsworth, whose iPhoneenabled real-time surveys of people's moods are providing an ultra-high-resolution picture of how our emotional states shift from minute to minute.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

These fundamental questions are not answered within the sphere of smell science; we do not know what it is about a molecule that ... smells. I report, here, the status quo theories for olfaction, highlighting what we do not know, and explaining why dismissing the perception of the input as 'too subjective' acts as a roadblock not conducive to scientific inquiry. I outline the current and new theory that conjectures a mechanism for signal transduction based on quantum mechanical phenomena, dubbed the 'swipe card', which is perhaps controversial but feasible. I show that such lines of thinking may answer some questions, or at least pose the right questions. Most importantly, I draw links and comparisons as to how better understanding of how small (10's of atoms) molecules can interact so specially with large (10,000's of atoms) proteins in a way that is so integral to healthy living.

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

The periodic table gave rise to a central paradigm, which did for chemistry what Newton had done for physics and Darwin for biology. Subsequently the Essay recounts the popularization of the Periodic Table through literature by Primo Levi, Oliver Sacks and others, and through music and art by composers and artists, such as Jerry Feldman, the King Crimson band, Tom Lehrer, and George Brecht, Blair Bradshaw, Eugènia Balcells, etc.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Thanks to Cannizzaro's and Paternò's efforts, a new journal, Gazzetta Chimica Italiana, was printed in Palermo. The journal collected original papers from Italian chemists, and summaries or translations of foreign ones.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Each derivative can be isolated as 2R, 2'R/2S, 2'S (a) and 2R, 2'S- or 2S, 2'R- meso (b) diastereomers, which were explored by means of carrageenin edema test, acetic acid writhing and hot plate tests, and also tested for gastrolesive potential and LD50. Independently of lipophilic and electronic features, disulfides 3b, 4b and disulfones 7a, 8a, 8b displayed interesting activity levels which appear to be mainly linked to the disubstitution pattern on benzenic rings.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

However, aromaticity is not an unambiguous term; therefore, its definition is enumerative. The criteria are based on energy (increased stability), molecular geometry (very low bond lengths alternation), magnetism (induction of the diatropic ring current by external magnetic field) and reactivity (tendency to maintain π-electron structure in chemical reactions). The energetic criterion is based on resonance energy and aromatic stabilization energy, whereas harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity-on molecular geometry. Magnetism-based criteria are illustrated by local indicators (for individual rings): nucleus independent chemical shifts and proton nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts as well as the global aromaticity index-exaltation of the magnetic susceptibility. For selected homo- and hetero-cyclic compounds, illustrative data are presented in tables, which allow the comparison of the above-mentioned indices. Finally, examples of agreements or disagreements between these various aromaticity indices are presented for few representative cases.",

The periodic table gave rise to a central paradigm, which did for chemistry what Newton had done for physics and Darwin for biology. Subsequently the Essay recounts the popularization of the Periodic Table through literature by Primo Levi, Oliver Sacks and others, and through music and art by composers and artists, such as Jerry Feldman, the King Crimson band, Tom Lehrer, and George Brecht, Blair Bradshaw, Eugènia Balcells, etc.",

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech.

For example, drawing positive and negative electrostatic isopotential surfaces partitions the molecule into regions subject to nucleophilic or electrophilic attack. Similarly, coloring isodensity surfaces to indicate the magnitude of the gradient of the electron density maps the molecule surface into regions of high and low electronegativity. A basic understanding of reaction mechanisms can also come from viewing and manipulating isovalued surfaces. A theory of molecular interactions, based upon second-order perturbation theory, provides for the decomposition of the intermolecular interaction energy into steric, electrostatic and orbital interactions. Color figures illustrate the docking of reactant molecular densities, electrostatic potentials and orbitals on low-energy pathways. The figures are used to visualize the steric, electrostatic and orbital contributions to molecular interaction energy. The visualization not only identifies low-energy reaction pathways, but it frequently reveals local interactions which determine the magnitude of the total interaction energy. Similar insight is not easily obtained by simple evaluation of the total interaction energy. Approximate transition states, built from structures along low-energy approach pathways, are excellent starting points for transition state searches.",

Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry programs; others are calculated by Gabedit before display. Molecular orbitals, electron density, electrostatic potential, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding density, and any other volumetric data properties can be displayed. It can display electronic circular dichroism, UV-visible, infrared, and Raman-computed spectra after a convolution. Gabedit can generate a Povray file for geometry, surfaces, contours, and color-coded planes. Output can be exported to a selection of popular image and vector graphics file formats; the program can also generate a series of pictures for animation. Quantum mechanical electrostatic potentials can be calculated using the partial charges on atoms, or by solving the Poisson equation using the multigrid method. The atoms in molecule charges can also be calculated. Gabedit is platform independent.

When I think of Tetsuo Nozoe, these are the images that immediately come to mind. When I think of the Nozoe Autograph Books, I also think of time. For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

Theory Comput. 16, 1555-1567 (2020)], which fix one of the largest issues hindering this approach. By using the first-order effective Hamiltonian coupling elements, the weighting scheme implicitly takes into account the symmetry of the states, thereby averaging Fock operators only if the zeroth-order wave functions interact with each other. The use of Hamiltonian couplings also provides a physically sounder approach to quantitate the relative weights; however, it introduces new difficulties when these rapidly die off to zero. The improved XDW-CASPT2 method is critically tested on several systems of photochemical relevance, and it is shown that it succeeds in its original intent of maintaining MS-CASPT2 accuracy for the evaluation of transition energies and at the same time providing smooth potential energy surfaces around near-degenerate points akin to XMS-CASPT2.",

Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The yaInChI theme is applicable for checking the structural identity with higher sensitivity and generating three-dimensional (3-D) structures from the one-dimensional (1-D) string with less ambiguity than the general InChI method. The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair. Additionally, yaInChI better preserves the original information of the given input file (SDF) using the protonation information, hydrogen count +1, and original bond type, which are not considered or restrictively considered in InChI and SMILES. When yaInChI is used to perform a duplication check on a 3D chemical structure database, Ligand.Info, it shows more discriminating power than InChI.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Jmol is a widely used open-source molecular visualization and analysis tool written in Java and implemented in both Java and JavaScript. Over the past 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, work on Jmol has included the development of dialects of SMILES and SMARTS that incorporate novel aspects that allow new and powerful applications. The specifications of \"Jmol SMILES\" and \"Jmol SMARTS\" are described. The dialects most closely resemble OpenSMILES and OpenSMARTS. Jmol SMILES is a superset of OpenSMILES, allowing a freer format, including whitespace and comments, the addition of \"processing directives\" that modify the meaning of certain aspects of SMILES processing such as aromaticity and stereochemistry, a more extensive treatment of stereochemistry, and several minor additions. Jmol SMARTS similarly adds these same modifications to OpenSMARTS, but also adds a number of additional \"primitives\" and elements of syntax tuned to matching 3D molecular structures and selecting their atoms. The result is an expansion of the capabilities of SMILES and SMARTS primarily for use in 3D molecular analysis, allowing a broader range of matching involving any combination of 3D molecular structures, SMILES strings, and SMARTS patterns. While developed specifically for Jmol, these dialects of SMILES and SMARTS are independent of the Jmol application itself. Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS add value to standard SMILES and SMARTS. Together they have proven exceptionally capable in extracting valuable information from 3D structural models, as demonstrated in Jmol. Capabilities in Jmol enabled by Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS include efficient MMFF94 atom typing, conformational identification, SMILES comparisons without canonicalization, identification of stereochemical relationships, quantitative comparison of 3D structures from different sources (including differences in Kekulization), conformational flexible fitting, and atom mapping used to synchronize interactive displays of 2D structures, 3D structures, and spectral correlations, where data are being drawn from multiple sources.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES.

Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database.

In the context of virtual screening, chemical databases to be screened are often initially represented by canonicalised SMILES strings that can be filtered and pre-processed in a number of ways, resulting in molecules that occupy similar regions of chemical space to active compounds of a therapeutic target. A wide variety of software exists to convert molecules into SMILES format, namely, Mol2smi (Daylight Inc.), MOE (Chemical Computing Group) and Babel (Openeye Scientific Software). Depending on the algorithm employed, the atoms of a SMILES string defining a molecule can be ordered differently. Upon conversion to 3D coordinates they result in the production of ostensibly the same molecule. In this work we show how different permutations of a SMILES string can affect conformer generation, affecting reliability and repeatability of the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel procedure for the generation of conformers, taking advantage of the permutation of the input strings--both SMILES and other 2D formats, leading to more effective sampling of conformation space in output, and also implementing fingerprint and principal component analyses step to post process and visualise the results.",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

In this article, the ongoing work to describe the chemical connectivity of entries contained in the Crystallography Open Database (COD) in SMILES format is reported. This collection of SMILES is publicly available for chemical (substructure) search or for any other purpose on an open-access basis, as is the COD itself. The conventions that have been followed for the representation of compounds that do not fit into the valence bond theory are outlined for the most frequently found cases. The procedure for getting the SMILES out of the CIF files starts with checking whether the atoms in the asymmetric unit are a chemically acceptable image of the compound. When they are not (molecule in a symmetry element, disorder, polymeric species,etc.), the previously published cif_molecule program is used to get such image in many cases. The program package Open Babel is then applied to get SMILES strings from the CIF files (either those directly taken from the COD or those produced by cif_molecule when applicable). The results are then checked and/or fixed by a human editor, in a computer-aided task that at present still consumes a great deal of human time. Even if the procedure still needs to be improved to make it more automatic (and hence faster), it has already yielded more than 160,000 curated chemical structures and the purpose of this article is to announce the existence of this work to the chemical community as well as to spread the use of its results.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

While quantum chemical computations can provide accurate stacking interaction energies, these come at a steep computational cost. To address this challenge, we recently developed quantitative predictive models of stacking interactions between druglike heterocycles and the aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr, and Trp (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.9b00936 ). These models depend on heterocycle descriptors derived from electrostatic potentials (ESPs) computed using density functional theory and provide accurate stacking interactions without the need for expensive computations on stacked dimers. Herein, we show that these ESP-based descriptors can be reliably evaluated directly from the atom connectivity of the heterocycle, providing a means of predicting both the descriptors and the potential for a given heterocycle to engage in stacking interactions without resorting to any quantum chemical computations. This enables the rapid conversion of simple molecular representations (e.g., SMILES) directly into accurate stacking interaction energies using a freely available online tool, thereby providing a way to rank the stacking abilities of large sets of heterocycles.",

In 1807, Sir Humphry Davy surprised everyone by electrolytically preparing (and naming) potassium and sodium metals. In 1808, he noted their interaction with ammonia, which, 100 years later, was attributed to solvated electrons. After 1960, pulse radiolysis of nearly any solvent produced solvated electrons, which became one of the most studied species in chemistry. In 1968, alkali metal solutions in amines and ethers were shown to contain alkali metal anions in addition to solvated electrons. The advent of crown ethers and cryptands as complexants for alkali cations greatly enhanced alkali metal solubilities. This permitted us to prepare a crystalline salt of Na(-) in 1974, followed by 30 other alkalides with Na(-), K(-), Rb(-) and Cs(-) anions. This firmly established the -1 oxidation state of alkali metals. The synthesis of alkalides led to the crystallization of electrides, with trapped electrons as the anions. Electrides have a variety of electronic and magnetic properties, depending on the geometries and connectivities of the trapping sites. In 2009, the final surprise was the experimental demonstration that alkali metals under high pressure lose their metallic character as the electrons are localized in voids between the alkali cations to become high-pressure electrides!

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

We present a pilot study to explore the possibility of conducting the ATC prediction solely based on the molecular structures. The motivation is to eliminate the reliance on the costly lab experiments so that the characteristics of a drug can be pre-assessed for better decision-making and effort-saving before the actual development. To this end, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 4545 compounds which is with larger scale than the one used in previous study. A light-weight prediction model is proposed. The model is with better explainability in the sense that it is consists of a straightforward tokenization that extracts and embeds statistically and physicochemically meaningful tokens, and a deep network backed by a set of pyramid kernels to capture multi-resolution chemical structural characteristics. Its efficacy has been validated in the experiments where it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 15.53% in accuracy and by 69.66% in terms of efficiency.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Quasi-SMILES is a sequence of symbols, which represents all available eclectic data, i.e. not only molecular structure, but also different conditions, which can have influence on examined endpoint (e.g. kinds of cells: human breast; human colon; human liver; human lung). In this work, quasi-SMILES have been used to establish predictive models for anticancer activity isoquinoline quinones related to different cells. Descriptor calculated with optimal correlation weights of different fragments of quasi-SMILES defined by the Monte Carlo technique is used to predict pIC50 as a mathematical function of molecular structure and kinds of cells. The using of the so-called index of ideality of correlation for optimization by the Monte Carlo method improves predictive potential of the model. The statistical quality of the models based on correlation weights of fragments of quasi-SMILES is good. The range of correlation coefficient between experimental and calculated pIC50 for external validation set is 0.76-0.89. The statistical stable promoters for increase and for decrease in pIC50 are established. These models can be used to improve quality of pharmaceutical agents. These computational experiments can be reproduced with available on the Internet software ( http://www.insilico.eu/coral ).",

To efficiently learn molecular features along all message paths, in this paper we encode multiple SMILES for every molecule as an automated data augmentation for the prediction of molecular properties, which alleviates the overfitting problem caused by the small amount of data in the datasets of molecular property prediction. As a result, by using the multiple SMILES-based augmentation, we obtained better molecular representation and showed superior performance in the tasks of predicting molecular properties.",

Ernest Fourneau (1872-1949) and the transformation of the field of medicinal chemistry in France].\nThe synthetic local anaesthetic Stovaine was commercialised in France in 1904. Its inventor, Ernest Fourneau, began his career as a pharmaceutical chemist in organic chemistry laboratories in Germany, where from 1899 to 1901 he discovered how basic research could benefit from the modern chemistry theories which had developed in Germany starting in the 1860s. Using the complex structure of cocaine, he invented an original molecule, with comparable activity, but less toxic. The knowledge and the know-how which he acquired in Germany nourished his reflection in the field of the chemistry of the relationships between structure and activity, and led him to the development of Stovaïne. Emile Roux, Director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was interested in his work and invited him to head the first French therapeutic chemistry laboratory, in which research on medicinal chemistry was organised scientifically. The industrial development of new medicines resulting from the Pasteur Institute's therapeutic chemistry laboratory was supported by the Etablissements Poulenc frères, France thus gaining international reputation in the domain of pharmaceutical chemistry.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

An Examination of Products Advertised as Kratom.\nAlthough some novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are newly discovered chemicals, others are traditional or indigenous substances that are introduced to new markets. One of these latter substances is a plant many people refer to as kratom. Indigenous to Southeast Asia and used for a variety of instrumental and recreational purposes, kratom has recently become available to Western drug users. Kratom is somewhat unique in that the plant contains two different psychoactive chemicals, which have both stimulant (mitragynine) and narcotic (7-hydroxymitragynine) properties. Thus, kratom may appeal to different types of drug users for reasons other than curiosity. In the current study, 15 samples of products that were either directly advertised as kratom or were listed in the results of a web search (but were not directly advertised as kratom) were purchased for testing. After laboratory testing, it was determined that all products advertised as kratom contained the active chemical mitragynine, but 7-hydroxymitragynine was not detected in any of the samples.

Tiemann, together with Paul Krüger (1859-1916) and then with Friedrich-Wilhelm Semmler (1860-1931), developed a method to obtain with a good yield <iVeilchenduft</i (violet scent); they condensed citral with di-methyl-ketone (acetone) thus generating an intermediate which upon exposure to an acidic environment cyclizes to ionone. By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners. While a number of chemists and pharmacists were involved in the synthesis of Ionone (<iVeilchenduft</i; violet scent) and irone (iris scent), with few exceptions, their biographies are pretty well documented. In contrast, very little transpired about Dr. Paul Krüger, who spent some seven years trying to iron out the difficulties of ionone synthesis. The purpose of this short contribution is to shed some light on the life and work of Paul Krüger while providing an overview on the status of ionone pharmacology and to highlight the historical significance of ionone synthesis.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

First, they're standardized and open formats for anyone to use. In addition, JPEG is an ISO standard and PNG is an IETF RFC (Internet Engineering Task Force Request for Comments-www.ietf.org) and W3C recommendation (World Wide Web Consortium-www.w3.org). Second, they're compressible. GIF files are generally compressed at 5:1, JPEG at 10:1 or 20:1 and PNG at about 7:1. Finally, they're all supported by web browsers. Well, pretty much. Microsoft's Internet Explorer doesn't support the alpha channel transparency for PNG-but, on the other hand, GIF and JPEG don't have the alpha channel at all. Use TIFF to archive your original pictures as it is a lossless format. Check out the summary table and sidebar for more information regarding these picture file formats.",

SmilesDrawer can draw structurally and stereochemically complex structures such as maitotoxin and C<sub60</sub without using templates, yet has an exceptionally small computational footprint and low memory usage without the requirement for loading images or any other form of client-server communication, making it easy to integrate even in secure (intranet, firewalled) or offline applications. These features allow the rendering of thousands of molecular structure drawings on a single web page within seconds on a wide range of hardware supporting modern browsers. The source code as well as the most recent build of SmilesDrawer is available on Github ( http://doc.gdb.tools/smilesDrawer/ ). Both yarn and npm packages are also available.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

These fundamental questions are not answered within the sphere of smell science; we do not know what it is about a molecule that ... smells. I report, here, the status quo theories for olfaction, highlighting what we do not know, and explaining why dismissing the perception of the input as 'too subjective' acts as a roadblock not conducive to scientific inquiry. I outline the current and new theory that conjectures a mechanism for signal transduction based on quantum mechanical phenomena, dubbed the 'swipe card', which is perhaps controversial but feasible. I show that such lines of thinking may answer some questions, or at least pose the right questions. Most importantly, I draw links and comparisons as to how better understanding of how small (10's of atoms) molecules can interact so specially with large (10,000's of atoms) proteins in a way that is so integral to healthy living.

Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist.

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Faraday Soc., 1950, 9, 14-19): \"The emitting electronic level of a given multiplicity is the lowest excited level of that multiplicity\". Therefore, Kasha's rule focuses on the emission (photophysics) for complex molecules, in condensed phase, for the absorption of one photon per molecule under photostationary conditions, then a rapid internal conversion and a vibrational relaxation warrant that the corresponding emission comes from the first excited electronic level regardless of which electronic state of equal multiplicity is excited.",

Smith III, the Rhodes-Thompson Professor of Chemistry and Member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center at the University of Pennsylvania, has mentored well over 100 doctoral and masters students, more than 200 postdoctoral associates and numerous undergraduates, in addition to collaborating with a wide spectrum of internationally recognized scholars. His research interests, broadly stated, comprise complex molecule synthesis, the development of new, versatile and highly effective synthetic methods, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, peptide mimicry chemistry and material science. Each area demands a high level of synthetic design and execution. United by a passion to unlock the secrets of organic synthesis, and perhaps of Nature itself, innumerable lessons have been, and continue to be, learned by the members of the Smith Group.

Tiemann, together with Paul Krüger (1859-1916) and then with Friedrich-Wilhelm Semmler (1860-1931), developed a method to obtain with a good yield <iVeilchenduft</i (violet scent); they condensed citral with di-methyl-ketone (acetone) thus generating an intermediate which upon exposure to an acidic environment cyclizes to ionone. By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners. While a number of chemists and pharmacists were involved in the synthesis of Ionone (<iVeilchenduft</i; violet scent) and irone (iris scent), with few exceptions, their biographies are pretty well documented. In contrast, very little transpired about Dr. Paul Krüger, who spent some seven years trying to iron out the difficulties of ionone synthesis. The purpose of this short contribution is to shed some light on the life and work of Paul Krüger while providing an overview on the status of ionone pharmacology and to highlight the historical significance of ionone synthesis.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Even after accepting that some signals are reliable because of their strategic costs, he argued for a pluralistic approach to signal reliability. Signal complexity was a developing interest when he died. Signals usually involve several components, some of which appear to amplify other signal components.

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

However, their findings cannot be generalized to other icons that were not included in the study, which, we argue, is their main limitation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of icons that is intended to enable the generalization of the findings of recognition studies. To accomplish this, we analyzed a sample of more than eight hundred icons according to three axes: lexical category, semantic category, and representation strategy. Three basic representation strategies were identified: visual similarity; semantic association; and arbitrary convention. These representation strategies are in agreement with the strategies identified in previous taxonomies. However, a greater number of subcategories of these strategies were identified. Our results also indicate that the lexical and semantic attributes of a concept influence the choice of representation strategy.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Quasi-SMILES is a sequence of symbols, which represents all available eclectic data, i.e. not only molecular structure, but also different conditions, which can have influence on examined endpoint (e.g. kinds of cells: human breast; human colon; human liver; human lung). In this work, quasi-SMILES have been used to establish predictive models for anticancer activity isoquinoline quinones related to different cells. Descriptor calculated with optimal correlation weights of different fragments of quasi-SMILES defined by the Monte Carlo technique is used to predict pIC50 as a mathematical function of molecular structure and kinds of cells. The using of the so-called index of ideality of correlation for optimization by the Monte Carlo method improves predictive potential of the model. The statistical quality of the models based on correlation weights of fragments of quasi-SMILES is good. The range of correlation coefficient between experimental and calculated pIC50 for external validation set is 0.76-0.89. The statistical stable promoters for increase and for decrease in pIC50 are established. These models can be used to improve quality of pharmaceutical agents.

We present a pilot study to explore the possibility of conducting the ATC prediction solely based on the molecular structures. The motivation is to eliminate the reliance on the costly lab experiments so that the characteristics of a drug can be pre-assessed for better decision-making and effort-saving before the actual development. To this end, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 4545 compounds which is with larger scale than the one used in previous study. A light-weight prediction model is proposed. The model is with better explainability in the sense that it is consists of a straightforward tokenization that extracts and embeds statistically and physicochemically meaningful tokens, and a deep network backed by a set of pyramid kernels to capture multi-resolution chemical structural characteristics. Its efficacy has been validated in the experiments where it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 15.53% in accuracy and by 69.66% in terms of efficiency.

Due to the complexity of this ruleset a correct chemical name assignment remains challenging for human beings and there are only a few rule-based cheminformatics toolkits available that support this task in an automated manner. Here we present STOUT (SMILES-TO-IUPAC-name translator), a deep-learning neural machine translation approach to generate the IUPAC name for a given molecule from its SMILES string as well as the reverse translation, i.e. predicting the SMILES string from the IUPAC name. In both cases, the system is able to predict with an average BLEU score of about 90% and a Tanimoto similarity index of more than 0.9.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair.

Jmol is a widely used open-source molecular visualization and analysis tool written in Java and implemented in both Java and JavaScript. Over the past 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, work on Jmol has included the development of dialects of SMILES and SMARTS that incorporate novel aspects that allow new and powerful applications. The specifications of \"Jmol SMILES\" and \"Jmol SMARTS\" are described. The dialects most closely resemble OpenSMILES and OpenSMARTS. Jmol SMILES is a superset of OpenSMILES, allowing a freer format, including whitespace and comments, the addition of \"processing directives\" that modify the meaning of certain aspects of SMILES processing such as aromaticity and stereochemistry, a more extensive treatment of stereochemistry, and several minor additions. Jmol SMARTS similarly adds these same modifications to OpenSMARTS, but also adds a number of additional \"primitives\" and elements of syntax tuned to matching 3D molecular structures and selecting their atoms. The result is an expansion of the capabilities of SMILES and SMARTS primarily for use in 3D molecular analysis, allowing a broader range of matching involving any combination of 3D molecular structures, SMILES strings, and SMARTS patterns. While developed specifically for Jmol, these dialects of SMILES and SMARTS are independent of the Jmol application itself. Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS add value to standard SMILES and SMARTS. Together they have proven exceptionally capable in extracting valuable information from 3D structural models, as demonstrated in Jmol. Capabilities in Jmol enabled by Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS include efficient MMFF94 atom typing, conformational identification, SMILES comparisons without canonicalization, identification of stereochemical relationships, quantitative comparison of 3D structures from different sources (including differences in Kekulization), conformational flexible fitting, and atom mapping used to synchronize interactive displays of 2D structures, 3D structures, and spectral correlations, where data are being drawn from multiple sources.",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs.

A name registered as a trade mark is the company's property and cannot be used by others.

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist.

Within short reaction time (15 min) under ultrasonic irradiation, compared to normal laboratory conditions, (4-16 h), we can achieve good to excellent yields. The reaction time is shortened because ultrasound can accelerate the generation of the nucleophile of the pyridinium salt and subsequently a nucleophilic addition of an aldehyde followed by dehydration affords the styrylpyridinium dye, (Knoevenagel condensation). The photophysical properties of all compounds are comprehensively investigated in different solvents. All the compounds exhibit negative solvatochromism both in absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. Such behavior is due to the higher dipole moment of these molecules at the ground state.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

When I think of Tetsuo Nozoe, these are the images that immediately come to mind. When I think of the Nozoe Autograph Books, I also think of time. For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

Over this period, Amos B. Smith III, the Rhodes-Thompson Professor of Chemistry and Member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center at the University of Pennsylvania, has mentored well over 100 doctoral and masters students, more than 200 postdoctoral associates and numerous undergraduates, in addition to collaborating with a wide spectrum of internationally recognized scholars. His research interests, broadly stated, comprise complex molecule synthesis, the development of new, versatile and highly effective synthetic methods, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, peptide mimicry chemistry and material science. Each area demands a high level of synthetic design and execution. United by a passion to unlock the secrets of organic synthesis, and perhaps of Nature itself, innumerable lessons have been, and continue to be, learned by the members of the Smith Group. This lead article in a Special Issue of the Journal of Antibiotics affords an opportunity to share some of those lessons learned, albeit a small selection of personal favorites.",

Tiemann, together with Paul Krüger (1859-1916) and then with Friedrich-Wilhelm Semmler (1860-1931), developed a method to obtain with a good yield <iVeilchenduft</i (violet scent); they condensed citral with di-methyl-ketone (acetone) thus generating an intermediate which upon exposure to an acidic environment cyclizes to ionone. By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners. While a number of chemists and pharmacists were involved in the synthesis of Ionone (<iVeilchenduft</i; violet scent) and irone (iris scent), with few exceptions, their biographies are pretty well documented. In contrast, very little transpired about Dr. Paul Krüger, who spent some seven years trying to iron out the difficulties of ionone synthesis. The purpose of this short contribution is to shed some light on the life and work of Paul Krüger while providing an overview on the status of ionone pharmacology and to highlight the historical significance of ionone synthesis.",

The resulting measure combines 21 physicochemical features of the odorants into a single number-expressed in radians-that accurately predicts the extent of perceptual similarity between multicomponent odorant pairs. To assess the usefulness of this measure, we investigated whether we could use it to create olfactory metamers. To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts. The accurate predictions of perceptual similarity, and the ensuing creation of olfactory metamers, suggest that we have obtained a valid olfactory measure, one that may enable the digitization of smell.",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting.

The reported solvation equation, which fits the data with considerable precision, describes sensory potency in terms of interaction via electron pairs, dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and basicity, and hydrophobicity. It correspondingly suggests relevant physicochemical properties of the biophase where the sensory response is brought about. The equation implies that in the range of molecular size where nonreactive VOCs can produce any pungency, transport from the air to the biophase strictly determines potency. In this respect, the potency of nasal pungency shares characteristics with the ability of VOCs to cause narcosis and anesthesia.",

The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Assuming CO2 solutions in the mouth stimulate only trigeminal nerve endings, this result is not altogether surprising; however, there are neurophysiological data indicating that CO2 stimulates gustatory as well as trigeminal fibers. In that case, carbonation might alter the quality profile of a stimulus without producing substantial changes in overall taste intensity--much as occurs when qualitatively different taste stimuli are mixed. To address this possibility, subjects were asked to rate the total taste intensity of moderate concentrations of stimuli representing each of the basic tastes and their binary combinations, with an without added carbonation. They then subdivided total taste intensity into the proportions of sweetness, saltiness, sourness, bitterness and 'other taste qualities' they perceived. The addition of carbonation produced only small increases in ratings of total taste intensity. However, rather dramatic alterations in the quality profiles of stimuli were observed, particularly for sweet and salty tastes. The nature of the interaction is consistent with a direct effect of carbonation/CO2 on the gustatory system, although the possibility that at least some of the observed effects reflect trigeminal-gustatory interactions cannot be ruled out.",

Tiemann, together with Paul Krüger (1859-1916) and then with Friedrich-Wilhelm Semmler (1860-1931), developed a method to obtain with a good yield <iVeilchenduft</i (violet scent); they condensed citral with di-methyl-ketone (acetone) thus generating an intermediate which upon exposure to an acidic environment cyclizes to ionone. By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners. While a number of chemists and pharmacists were involved in the synthesis of Ionone (<iVeilchenduft</i; violet scent) and irone (iris scent), with few exceptions, their biographies are pretty well documented. In contrast, very little transpired about Dr. Paul Krüger, who spent some seven years trying to iron out the difficulties of ionone synthesis.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

By contrast, scientists have been unable to develop a physical measure linked to perceived smell, even one that merely reflects the extent of perceptual similarity between odorants<sup2</sup.

The resulting measure combines 21 physicochemical features of the odorants into a single number-expressed in radians-that accurately predicts the extent of perceptual similarity between multicomponent odorant pairs. To assess the usefulness of this measure, we investigated whether we could use it to create olfactory metamers. To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts. The accurate predictions of perceptual similarity, and the ensuing creation of olfactory metamers, suggest that we have obtained a valid olfactory measure, one that may enable the digitization of smell.",

Our QSAR was developed upon previously published nasal pungency thresholds in anosmics, i.e., patients lacking a sense of smell and thus responding only to sensory irritation evoked by trigeminal nerve stimulation. The reported solvation equation, which fits the data with considerable precision, describes sensory potency in terms of interaction via electron pairs, dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and basicity, and hydrophobicity. It correspondingly suggests relevant physicochemical properties of the biophase where the sensory response is brought about. The equation implies that in the range of molecular size where nonreactive VOCs can produce any pungency, transport from the air to the biophase strictly determines potency. In this respect, the potency of nasal pungency shares characteristics with the ability of VOCs to cause narcosis and anesthesia.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units.

However, previous methods depend on interactions extracted from STITCH dataset which may make it depend on lab experiments. We present a pilot study to explore the possibility of conducting the ATC prediction solely based on the molecular structures. The motivation is to eliminate the reliance on the costly lab experiments so that the characteristics of a drug can be pre-assessed for better decision-making and effort-saving before the actual development. To this end, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 4545 compounds which is with larger scale than the one used in previous study. A light-weight prediction model is proposed. The model is with better explainability in the sense that it is consists of a straightforward tokenization that extracts and embeds statistically and physicochemically meaningful tokens, and a deep network backed by a set of pyramid kernels to capture multi-resolution chemical structural characteristics. Its efficacy has been validated in the experiments where it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 15.53% in accuracy and by 69.66% in terms of efficiency.

These datasets were used to train the image-to-SMILES neural network with the goal of maximizing the hand-drawn hydrocarbon recognition accuracy. By forming a committee of the trained neural networks where each network casts one vote for the predicted molecule, we achieved a nearly 10 percentage point improvement of the molecule recognition accuracy and were able to assign a confidence value for the prediction based on the number of agreeing votes. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 76% on hand-drawn hydrocarbons, increasing to 86% if the top 3 predictions were considered.",

By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners.

By contrast, scientists have been unable to develop a physical measure linked to perceived smell, even one that merely reflects the extent of perceptual similarity between odorants<sup2</sup. Here, to generate such a measure, we collected perceptual similarity estimates of 49,788 pairwise odorants from 199 participants who smelled 242 different multicomponent odorants and used these data to refine a predictive model that links odorant structure to odorant perception<sup3</sup. The resulting measure combines 21 physicochemical features of the odorants into a single number-expressed in radians-that accurately predicts the extent of perceptual similarity between multicomponent odorant pairs. To assess the usefulness of this measure, we investigated whether we could use it to create olfactory metamers. To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts. The accurate predictions of perceptual similarity, and the ensuing creation of olfactory metamers, suggest that we have obtained a valid olfactory measure, one that may enable the digitization of smell.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Many icon recognition studies have been conducted in the past. However, their findings cannot be generalized to other icons that were not included in the study, which, we argue, is their main limitation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of icons that is intended to enable the generalization of the findings of recognition studies. To accomplish this, we analyzed a sample of more than eight hundred icons according to three axes: lexical category, semantic category, and representation strategy. Three basic representation strategies were identified: visual similarity; semantic association; and arbitrary convention. These representation strategies are in agreement with the strategies identified in previous taxonomies. However, a greater number of subcategories of these strategies were identified. Our results also indicate that the lexical and semantic attributes of a concept influence the choice of representation strategy.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

Even after accepting that some signals are reliable because of their strategic costs, he argued for a pluralistic approach to signal reliability. Signal complexity was a developing interest when he died. Signals usually involve several components, some of which appear to amplify other signal components.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Its inventor, Ernest Fourneau, began his career as a pharmaceutical chemist in organic chemistry laboratories in Germany, where from 1899 to 1901 he discovered how basic research could benefit from the modern chemistry theories which had developed in Germany starting in the 1860s. Using the complex structure of cocaine, he invented an original molecule, with comparable activity, but less toxic. The knowledge and the know-how which he acquired in Germany nourished his reflection in the field of the chemistry of the relationships between structure and activity, and led him to the development of Stovaïne. Emile Roux, Director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was interested in his work and invited him to head the first French therapeutic chemistry laboratory, in which research on medicinal chemistry was organised scientifically. The industrial development of new medicines resulting from the Pasteur Institute's therapeutic chemistry laboratory was supported by the Etablissements Poulenc frères, France thus gaining international reputation in the domain of pharmaceutical chemistry.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Style and Substance in Florentius Schuyl's Illustrations for Descartes' Treatise on Man.\nThe assumption that the Cartesian bête-machine is the invention of René Descartes (1596-1650) is rarely contested. Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

Style and Substance in Florentius Schuyl's Illustrations for Descartes' Treatise on Man.\nThe assumption that the Cartesian bête-machine is the invention of René Descartes (1596-1650) is rarely contested. Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

The other edition (Taoshi Xianyishukoucongshu) was probably done in the Late Qing Dynasty or the period of the Republic of China. By careful comparison, the contents of the two editions are basically the same, and only the preface of the former edition has been given some changes, which were probably made by later generations.

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The resulting measure combines 21 physicochemical features of the odorants into a single number-expressed in radians-that accurately predicts the extent of perceptual similarity between multicomponent odorant pairs. To assess the usefulness of this measure, we investigated whether we could use it to create olfactory metamers. To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts. The accurate predictions of perceptual similarity, and the ensuing creation of olfactory metamers, suggest that we have obtained a valid olfactory measure, one that may enable the digitization of smell.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

We present a pilot study to explore the possibility of conducting the ATC prediction solely based on the molecular structures.

To this end, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 4545 compounds which is with larger scale than the one used in previous study. A light-weight prediction model is proposed. The model is with better explainability in the sense that it is consists of a straightforward tokenization that extracts and embeds statistically and physicochemically meaningful tokens, and a deep network backed by a set of pyramid kernels to capture multi-resolution chemical structural characteristics.

Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database.

Leveraging recent breakthroughs in machine learning, we develop ChemPix: an offline, hand-drawn hydrocarbon structure recognition tool designed to remove these barriers. A neural image captioning approach consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) decoder learned a mapping from photographs of hand-drawn hydrocarbon structures to machine-readable SMILES representations. We generated a large auxiliary training dataset, based on RDKit molecular images, by combining image augmentation, image degradation and background addition. Additionally, a small dataset of ∼600 hand-drawn hydrocarbon chemical structures was crowd-sourced using a phone web application. These datasets were used to train the image-to-SMILES neural network with the goal of maximizing the hand-drawn hydrocarbon recognition accuracy. By forming a committee of the trained neural networks where each network casts one vote for the predicted molecule, we achieved a nearly 10 percentage point improvement of the molecule recognition accuracy and were able to assign a confidence value for the prediction based on the number of agreeing votes. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 76% on hand-drawn hydrocarbons, increasing to 86% if the top 3 predictions were considered.",

The model prediction accuracy benefits from training upon different canonicalized SMILES forms of the same molecules and does not decrease with increasing size, complexity, and structural flexibility. When a combination of two different canonicalized SMILES forms is used to train the model, the prediction accuracy improves. Largely distinguished from the previous fragment-based or descriptor-based models, the prediction accuracy of this NLP-based model does not decrease with increasing size, complexity, and structural flexibility of molecules.

When individual data contributors submit chemical substance descriptions to Substance, the unique chemical structures are extracted and stored into Compound through an automated process called structure standardization. The present study describes the PubChem standardization approaches and analyzes them for their success rates, reasons that cause structures to be rejected, and modifications applied to structures during the standardization process. Furthermore, the PubChem standardization is compared to the structure normalization of the IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI) software, as manifested by conversion of the InChI back into a chemical structure. The observed rejection rate for substances processed by PubChem standardization was 0.36%, which is predominantly attributed to structures with invalid atom valences that cannot be readily corrected without additional information from contributors. Of all structures that pass standardization, 44% are modified in the process, reducing the count of unique structures from 53,574,724 in substance to 45,808,881 in compound as identified by de-aromatized canonical isomeric SMILES. Even though the processing time is very low on average (only 0.4% of structures have individual standardization time above 0.1 s), total standardization time is completely dominated by edge cases: 90% of the time to standardize all structures in PubChem substance is spent on the 2.05% of structures with the highest individual standardization time. It is worth noting that 60% of the structures obtained from PubChem structure standardization are not identical to the chemical structure resulting from the InChI (primarily due to preferences for a different tautomeric form). Standardization of chemical structures is complicated by the diversity of chemical information and their representations approaches. The PubChem standardization is an effective and efficient tool to account for molecular diversity and to eliminate invalid/incomplete structures. Further development will concentrate on improved tautomer consideration and an expanded stereocenter definition. Modifications are difficult to thoroughly validate, with slight changes often affecting many thousands of structures and various edge cases. The PubChem structure standardization service is accessible as a public resource ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/standardize ), and via programmatic interfaces.",

We examined the semantics of these smell terms in 3 experiments (exemplar listing, similarity judgment and off-line rating). The exemplar listing task confirmed that Maniq smell terms have complex meanings encoding smell qualities. Analyses of the similarity data revealed that the odor lexicon is coherently structured by two dimensions. The underlying dimensions are pleasantness and dangerousness, as verified by the off-line rating study. Ethnographic data illustrate that smell terms have detailed semantics tapping into broader cultural constructs. Contrary to the widespread view that languages cannot encode odors, the Maniq data show odor can be a coherent semantic domain, thus shedding new light on the limits of language. ",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The model is with better explainability in the sense that it is consists of a straightforward tokenization that extracts and embeds statistically and physicochemically meaningful tokens, and a deep network backed by a set of pyramid kernels to capture multi-resolution chemical structural characteristics.

He created \"societies\" in Enlightenment-style for boys and young people with lectures and collections. Later on a circle of talented young students, scientists and poets met in his small room at the hospital. Some of them with Ole Mynster as the head set up a modern scientific journal, Physicalsk, oeconomisk og medicochirurgisk Bibliotek for Danmark og Norge which encouraged the introduction of antiphlogistic chemistry. Ole Mynster became physician at the Royal Frederik Hospital and lecturer in clinical pharmacology. He wrote the first book in Danish on pharmacology based upon chemistry. In their memoirs, prominent members of his circle have told about him, and his son F.L. Mynster has written a draft for a biography. An overview of the activities within natural science and medicine of the young Ole Hieronymus Mynster is presented.",

One can observe that the American book refers very often to French works coming from pharmacists, chemists and biologists who are, at the time, key references. They are particularly mentioned when talking about alkaloids, but also concerning herbs characterization and history of their discovery, as well as drugs or new active principles effects and toxicity. As opposed to Dorvault who try to help pharmacists by very practical information, the authors of the Dispensatory are doing a review of available scientific evidences, as an add on of the recently published American pharmacopeia in 1831. Among the main french authors that are mentioned, we can see Henry and Guibourt, Pelletier and Caventou, but also Soubeiran, Vauquelin, Robiquet, Orfila and many others. If the most consistent chapters are related to Quinquina, Opium and morphin, the American book, as l’Officine of Dorvault pay attention to have an almost exhaustive table of weight and measures that are still very different from one country to another.

The literature were explored using the keyword \"Schefflera\" in SciFinder®, Google Scholar®, and PubMed® databases. The taxonomy of all reported plants was authenticated using \"The Plant List\". Additional data on traditional uses was obtained from secondary references including books and online resources. Fourteen species were documented as traditional medicines in China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia, specifically to manage rheumatism, pain, and trauma. Other species are used in the treatment of liver disorders, skin conditions, respiratory infections, cancer, diarrhea, malaria, paralysis, and many other conditions. The main phytochemical constituents identified were triterpenoids and saponins, with sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, and lignans. Pharmacological properties of extracts and pure isolated compounds included analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, antimalarial, and antiallergic effects. The reported biological activities of Schefflera species support their traditional uses, although the available data, even for medicinal species, was limited.

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Signal complexity was a developing interest when he died. Signals usually involve several components, some of which appear to amplify other signal components.

However, their findings cannot be generalized to other icons that were not included in the study, which, we argue, is their main limitation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of icons that is intended to enable the generalization of the findings of recognition studies. To accomplish this, we analyzed a sample of more than eight hundred icons according to three axes: lexical category, semantic category, and representation strategy. Three basic representation strategies were identified: visual similarity; semantic association; and arbitrary convention. These representation strategies are in agreement with the strategies identified in previous taxonomies. However, a greater number of subcategories of these strategies were identified. Our results also indicate that the lexical and semantic attributes of a concept influence the choice of representation strategy.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Participants also rated the same pieces using bipolar verbal scales which aimed to encompass the concepts represented by the icons (e.g., the word \"red\" for the colour red). Furthermore, the icons themselves were subjected to open-ended verbal labelling to validate the icon scale. Colour icons spontaneously evoked a cross-modal association on 67% of occasions: blue being cool, and red/orange being warm or hot, and the icon scale had overall good face validity. Music regularly and consistently evoked multisensory associations (using the icon scale) including shapes, colours, weight, and temperatures, in addition to emotions.

Further separation of fractions perceived with the highest sensory impact, followed by LC-TOF-MS, LC-MS, and 1D/2D NMR experiments, led to the structure determination of the known alkylamides hydroxy-γ-sanshool (1), hydroxy-α-sanshool (2), hydroxy-β-sanshool (3), bungeanool (4), isobungeanool (5), and hydroxy-γ-isosanshool (6), as well as hydroxy-ε-sanshool (7), the structure of which has not yet been confirmed by NMR, and hydroxy-ζ-sanshool (8), which has not been previously reported in the literature.

Most remarkably, rubemamine (9) was able to further positively modulate the IMP-enhanced TAS1R1-TAS1R3 response to MSG ∼ 1.8-fold. Finally, armatamide (11), zanthosinamide (13), and dioxamine (14), which lack intrinsic umami taste in vivo and direct receptor response in vitro, also positively modulated receptor activation by MSG about twofold and the IMP-enhanced MSG-induced TAS1R1-TAS1R3 responses approximately by 50%.

The synthesized compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activities against bacterial and fungal strains, and their characteristics were investigated by assays under various temperature and pH conditions. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with the use of sheep erythrocytes and human neonate dermal fibroblasts. Similarly, agents such as lauric acid 6 and parabens 7a-b, which are used as preservative agents for commercial cosmetics and detergents, were assayed for comparison. Although the structure of 5a is simple, comprising a thiazole attached with an octyl group and acetic acid moiety, the compound showed stronger and broader antibacterial and antifungal activities among the 5 series against the tested microbes other than gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, 5a overcame the weak antifungal activity of parabens 7a-b. Also, the cytotoxicity of 5a was less than that of parabens 7a-b, especially to human dermal fibroblasts.

Musk odorants are indispensable in perfumery to lend sensuality to fine fragrances, a nourishing effect to cosmetics, and a comforting feeling to laundry. We have recently found serendipitously a new oxy-oxonia-Cope rearrangement. In this account, we review the background of oxonia-sigmatropic rearrangements and the discovery of this novel reaction. Special attention is focused on the versatile lactone and lactam formation reactions via [n+4] ring enlargement and the macrocyclization in the synthesis of new macrocyclic musks.

Although IPBC has claimed to be safe when used at concentrations less than 0.1%, the introduction of IPBC into cosmetics has led to several reports labeling IPBC as a potential new contact allergen.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The evolution of a productive synthetic strategy, as well as the synthetic challenges tackled, are described here in detail, including examples of related transformations. The successful synthetic strategy was inspired by the premise that the core structure could be derived from simple aromatic indole precursors by a reductive SmI2 -induced ketyl-aryl coupling. Other key reactions included a diastereoselective reduction and a regioselective elimination protocol. Altogether one of the shortest syntheses of iso-strychnine and hence of strychnine was established. ",

Within short reaction time (15 min) under ultrasonic irradiation, compared to normal laboratory conditions, (4-16 h), we can achieve good to excellent yields. The reaction time is shortened because ultrasound can accelerate the generation of the nucleophile of the pyridinium salt and subsequently a nucleophilic addition of an aldehyde followed by dehydration affords the styrylpyridinium dye, (Knoevenagel condensation). The photophysical properties of all compounds are comprehensively investigated in different solvents. All the compounds exhibit negative solvatochromism both in absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. Such behavior is due to the higher dipole moment of these molecules at the ground state.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

The reported solvation equation, which fits the data with considerable precision, describes sensory potency in terms of interaction via electron pairs, dipolarity/polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and basicity, and hydrophobicity. It correspondingly suggests relevant physicochemical properties of the biophase where the sensory response is brought about. The equation implies that in the range of molecular size where nonreactive VOCs can produce any pungency, transport from the air to the biophase strictly determines potency. In this respect, the potency of nasal pungency shares characteristics with the ability of VOCs to cause narcosis and anesthesia.",

Within short reaction time (15 min) under ultrasonic irradiation, compared to normal laboratory conditions, (4-16 h), we can achieve good to excellent yields. The reaction time is shortened because ultrasound can accelerate the generation of the nucleophile of the pyridinium salt and subsequently a nucleophilic addition of an aldehyde followed by dehydration affords the styrylpyridinium dye, (Knoevenagel condensation). The photophysical properties of all compounds are comprehensively investigated in different solvents. All the compounds exhibit negative solvatochromism both in absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. Such behavior is due to the higher dipole moment of these molecules at the ground state.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion.",

Mathematical modeling uncovers the appearance of the smiles, and both human and Bayesian classifiers validate these distinctions.

Morphological characteristics included co-activation of Orbicularis oculi (AU 6), smile controls, mouth opening, amplitude, and asymmetry of amplitude. Dynamic characteristics included duration, onset and offset velocity, asymmetry of velocity, and head movements. Smile characteristics were measured using the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman, Friesen, &amp; Hager, 2002) and Automated Facial Image Analysis (Cohn &amp; Kanade, 2007). Observers judged 122 smiles as amused, embarrassed, nervous, polite, or other. Fifty-three smiles met criteria for classification as perceived amused, embarrassed/nervous, or polite. In comparison with perceived polite, perceived amused more often included AU 6, open mouth, smile controls, larger amplitude, larger maximum onset and offset velocity, and longer duration. In comparison with perceived embarrassed/nervous, perceived amused more often included AU 6, lower maximum offset velocity, and smaller forward head pitch. In comparison with perceived polite, perceived embarrassed more often included mouth opening and smile controls, larger amplitude, and greater forward head pitch. Occurrence of the AU 6 in perceived embarrassed/nervous and polite smiles questions the assumption that AU 6 with a smile is sufficient to communicate felt enjoyment. By comparing three perceptually distinct types of smiles, we found that perceived smile meanings were related to specific variation in smile morphological and dynamic characteristics.",

Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database.

Accordingly, we suggest that there also exist various mental representations of smiles. Which representation is employed in cognition may depend on social factors, such as the smiling person's group membership: Since in-group members are typically seen as more benevolent than out-group members, in-group smiles should be associated with more benevolent social meaning than those conveyed by out-group members. We visualized in-group and out-group smiles with reverse correlation image classification. These visualizations indicated that mental representations of in-group smiles indeed express more benevolent social meaning than those of out-group smiles. The affective meaning of these visualized smiles was not influenced by group membership. Importantly, the effect occurred even though participants were not instructed to attend to the nature of the smile, pointing to an automatic association between group membership and intention. ",

The resulting measure combines 21 physicochemical features of the odorants into a single number-expressed in radians-that accurately predicts the extent of perceptual similarity between multicomponent odorant pairs.

To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts. The accurate predictions of perceptual similarity, and the ensuing creation of olfactory metamers, suggest that we have obtained a valid olfactory measure, one that may enable the digitization of smell.",

However, little is currently understood about how to conceptualize the experience, particularly in terms of whether chills are general markers of intense pleasure and emotion, or instead a collection of distinct phenomenological experiences. To address this, a web-study was designed using images, videos, music videos, texts and music excerpts (from both an online forum dedicated to chills-eliciting stimuli and previous musical chills study), to explore variations across chills experience in terms of bodily and emotional responses reported. Results suggest that across participants (N = 179), three distinct chills categories could be identified: warm chills (chills co-occurring with smiling, warmth, feeling relaxed, stimulated and happy), cold chills (chills co-occurring with frowning, cold, sadness and anger), and moving chills (chills co-occurring with tears, feeling a lump in the throat, emotional intensity, and feelings of affection, tenderness and being moved). Warm chills were linked to stimuli expressing social communion and love; cold chills were elicited by stimuli portraying entities in distress, and support from one to another; moving chills were elicited by most stimuli, but their incidence were also predicted by ratings of trait empathy. Findings are discussed in terms of being moved, the importance of differing induction mechanisms such as shared experience and empathic concern, and the implications of distinct chills categories for both individual differences and inconsistencies in the existing aesthetic chills literature.",

Swearing is positively correlated with extraversion and Type A hostility but negatively correlated with agreeableness, conscientiousness, religiosity, and sexual anxiety.

Recent advances in neural machine translation enable the auto-encoding of molecular structures in a continuous vector space of fixed size (latent representation) with low reconstruction errors. In this paper, we present a fast and accurate model combining deep convolutional neural network learning from molecule depictions and a pre-trained decoder that translates the latent representation into the SMILES representation of the molecules. This combination allows us to precisely infer a molecular structure from an image. Our rigorous evaluation shows that Img2Mol is able to correctly translate up to 88% of the molecular depictions into their SMILES representation.

However, such correlations were found only for participants who stated the eyes to be the most useful references, but not for those who favored the mouth. Moreover, participants who favored the eyes were more accurate and sensitive than those who favored the mouth. Our results thus indicate that Chinese who follow the typical Eastern decoding process of using the eyes as diagnostic cues to identify and interpret others' facial expressions and social intentions, are particularly accurate and sensitive, the more they self-report greater collectivistic and lower individualistic values.",

Leveraging recent breakthroughs in machine learning, we develop ChemPix: an offline, hand-drawn hydrocarbon structure recognition tool designed to remove these barriers. A neural image captioning approach consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) decoder learned a mapping from photographs of hand-drawn hydrocarbon structures to machine-readable SMILES representations. We generated a large auxiliary training dataset, based on RDKit molecular images, by combining image augmentation, image degradation and background addition. Additionally, a small dataset of ∼600 hand-drawn hydrocarbon chemical structures was crowd-sourced using a phone web application. These datasets were used to train the image-to-SMILES neural network with the goal of maximizing the hand-drawn hydrocarbon recognition accuracy. By forming a committee of the trained neural networks where each network casts one vote for the predicted molecule, we achieved a nearly 10 percentage point improvement of the molecule recognition accuracy and were able to assign a confidence value for the prediction based on the number of agreeing votes. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 76% on hand-drawn hydrocarbons, increasing to 86% if the top 3 predictions were considered.",

This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing.

Similar amounts of D and non-Duchenne (ND) smiles were observed in these 2 conditions (Experiment 1).

Sometimes, it is also possible to discover new structures via another way: the careful analysis of existing products and their production processes. In analyzing the production process of 1-oxacyclohexadecan-2-one (6), we identified at least two new oxa-bridged macrocyclic molecules. In continuation, these results inspired us to synthesize and evaluate more representatives with similar structures.

After times of searching for natural odor principles and serendipitous discoveries by chemical inspiration, directed odorant design today offers the highest hit rates for the discovery of new odorants, although serendipity still plays a role. Keeping intact the electronic shape required for a certain olfactophore-binding geometry, one can add or subtract structural elements, rigidify molecular structures, or introduce more structural flexibility. To find out which structural features are critical, the 'seco-approach', in which different fragments are removed by cutting strategic bonds, is the most analytical. Following this approach, such ingredients as Serenolide, Sylkolide, and Pomarose were designed. Transferring this design principle from the family of damascones to that of the theaspiranes led to the discovery of Cassyrane, though completely different structural features turned out to be relevant. Application of the seco-concept to a 3,7a-substituted 2,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-inden-5-yl musk lead structure derived from carotol resulted in the discovery of a new family of dienone musks with novel structure-odor correlations. However, cutting the C(2)-O bond of Cassyrane and oxidizing the resulting seco-structure to the 1,2,5,1″-tetradehydro derivative links the family of dienone musks with that of blackcurrant odorants, but the resulting target structures turned out to be potent orris odorants. (3E,5E)-5-(tert-Butyl)octadeca-3,5-dien-2-one even possesses the lowest odor threshold in the whole ionone family (0.036 ng/l air), which could be rationalized by a superposition analysis on (-)-cis-γ-irone. In the course of the synthesis of these high-impact orris odorants, we discovered that, depending on the reaction conditions, the dehydration step of the intermediate 5-hydroxyalk-3-yn-2-ones was accompanied by a carbenium-ion rearrangement. Depending on the substitution pattern, these rearrangement products and their derivatives possessed interesting musky-woody olfactory properties reminiscent of Cashmeran, demonstrating that the same structural elements can code for completely different odors, i.e., cassis, musk, orris, violet, and Cashmeran-type, depending only on their spatial arrangement.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Implicitly they contain the information needed to compute all kinds of molecular structures and, thus, molecular properties derived from these structures. We show that this implicit information can be accessed directly at SMILES string level without the need to apply explicit time-consuming conversion of the SMILES strings into molecular graphs or 3D structures with subsequent 2D or 3D QSPR calculations. Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units. The intrinsic aqueous solubility (LlogS) QSPR model achieved correlation coefficient values of R2=0.91, Q2=0.82, and RRMS=0.60 and QRMS=0.89 log units. Integral Tanimoto coefficients computed from LINGO profiles provided sharp discrimination between random and bioisoster pairs extracted from Accelrys Bioster Database.

Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Leveraging recent breakthroughs in machine learning, we develop ChemPix: an offline, hand-drawn hydrocarbon structure recognition tool designed to remove these barriers. A neural image captioning approach consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) decoder learned a mapping from photographs of hand-drawn hydrocarbon structures to machine-readable SMILES representations. We generated a large auxiliary training dataset, based on RDKit molecular images, by combining image augmentation, image degradation and background addition. Additionally, a small dataset of ∼600 hand-drawn hydrocarbon chemical structures was crowd-sourced using a phone web application. These datasets were used to train the image-to-SMILES neural network with the goal of maximizing the hand-drawn hydrocarbon recognition accuracy. By forming a committee of the trained neural networks where each network casts one vote for the predicted molecule, we achieved a nearly 10 percentage point improvement of the molecule recognition accuracy and were able to assign a confidence value for the prediction based on the number of agreeing votes. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 76% on hand-drawn hydrocarbons, increasing to 86% if the top 3 predictions were considered.",

Quasi-SMILES is a sequence of symbols, which represents all available eclectic data, i.e. not only molecular structure, but also different conditions, which can have influence on examined endpoint (e.g. kinds of cells: human breast; human colon; human liver; human lung). In this work, quasi-SMILES have been used to establish predictive models for anticancer activity isoquinoline quinones related to different cells. Descriptor calculated with optimal correlation weights of different fragments of quasi-SMILES defined by the Monte Carlo technique is used to predict pIC50 as a mathematical function of molecular structure and kinds of cells. The using of the so-called index of ideality of correlation for optimization by the Monte Carlo method improves predictive potential of the model. The statistical quality of the models based on correlation weights of fragments of quasi-SMILES is good. The range of correlation coefficient between experimental and calculated pIC50 for external validation set is 0.76-0.89. The statistical stable promoters for increase and for decrease in pIC50 are established. These models can be used to improve quality of pharmaceutical agents.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

In both cases, the system is able to predict with an average BLEU score of about 90% and a Tanimoto similarity index of more than 0.9.

One can observe that the American book refers very often to French works coming from pharmacists, chemists and biologists who are, at the time, key references. They are particularly mentioned when talking about alkaloids, but also concerning herbs characterization and history of their discovery, as well as drugs or new active principles effects and toxicity. As opposed to Dorvault who try to help pharmacists by very practical information, the authors of the Dispensatory are doing a review of available scientific evidences, as an add on of the recently published American pharmacopeia in 1831. Among the main french authors that are mentioned, we can see Henry and Guibourt, Pelletier and Caventou, but also Soubeiran, Vauquelin, Robiquet, Orfila and many others. If the most consistent chapters are related to Quinquina, Opium and morphin, the American book, as l’Officine of Dorvault pay attention to have an almost exhaustive table of weight and measures that are still very different from one country to another.

It was for them an opportunity to compare the inventories and to observe that a number of spices, herbs and other items were the same between the two professions.

His deeply religious spirit allowed him to penetrate into the most recondite of the human soul; in his personality, he expressed in its entire dimension the eternally unsatisfied desire of the solitary man, against the immensity of the universe. His philosophy, based on the respect for life, was realized throughout the practice of the medical profession. His noble character and personality was based on the man as symbol, since it was not so much what he did helping people but what people could do to others due to him. His singular example represented a moral force in the world, superior to millions of men armed for a war.

He was a very prolific polyhistor, publishing spiritual and occasional poetry, works on medicine, mathematics, rhetoric, dialectics, astronomy, linguistics and geography, editions of some ancient authors, and several translations. In 1573 he issued the pharmaceutical guide Enchiridion medicinae, which presents medications and remedies for individual health problems without any further comment on their effects and usage. However, this guide had a precursor, published in Paris in 1571, but with no mention of the author, and it is not certain that Henisch produced it. The text is de facto identical, there are only minimal variations, but the second edition has a longer title, it is extended with an introduction and the final part containing some prescriptions. In 1571, when the first edition was issued, Henisch was just 22-years old, and in 1573 he was still only 24, so in his case life experience cannot be taken into account. Comparison of the work with contemporary medical literature has shown that Enchiridion medicinae is not an original work, but a compilation of three works by other authors: De materia medicinali et compositione medicorum by G. Rondelet from 1556, a commentary to Galen´s Quos, quibus quando purgare oporteat by the French author Sebastien Coquilitus Scipio from 1553, and the book Lilium medicinae by Bernard de Gordon from 1550.

I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

In addition, exotic compounds with parallel C=C and N=N bonds were systematically studied in Hünig's group. Reflecting on the development of his research demonstrates both the importance of a systematic approach and how fruitful entirely unexpected results are if they meet a \"well-prepared mind\".

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Many icon recognition studies have been conducted in the past. However, their findings cannot be generalized to other icons that were not included in the study, which, we argue, is their main limitation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of icons that is intended to enable the generalization of the findings of recognition studies. To accomplish this, we analyzed a sample of more than eight hundred icons according to three axes: lexical category, semantic category, and representation strategy. Three basic representation strategies were identified: visual similarity; semantic association; and arbitrary convention. These representation strategies are in agreement with the strategies identified in previous taxonomies. However, a greater number of subcategories of these strategies were identified. Our results also indicate that the lexical and semantic attributes of a concept influence the choice of representation strategy.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

Smith III, the Rhodes-Thompson Professor of Chemistry and Member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center at the University of Pennsylvania, has mentored well over 100 doctoral and masters students, more than 200 postdoctoral associates and numerous undergraduates, in addition to collaborating with a wide spectrum of internationally recognized scholars. His research interests, broadly stated, comprise complex molecule synthesis, the development of new, versatile and highly effective synthetic methods, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, peptide mimicry chemistry and material science. Each area demands a high level of synthetic design and execution.

The language provides a rich syntax for database queries comparable to SMARTS. It provides full Markush, R-Group, reaction, and macro atom capabilities in a single unified notation. It includes the ability to specify 3D conformations and 2D depictions. All the information necessary to recreate the structure in a modeling or drawing package is present in a single, concise string of ASCII characters. This makes SLN ideal for structure communication over global computer networks between applications sitting at remote sites.

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair. Additionally, yaInChI better preserves the original information of the given input file (SDF) using the protonation information, hydrogen count +1, and original bond type, which are not considered or restrictively considered in InChI and SMILES. When yaInChI is used to perform a duplication check on a 3D chemical structure database, Ligand.Info, it shows more discriminating power than InChI.

The parameters are as follows: no more than five hydrogen bond donors (nitrogen or oxygen atoms with one or more hydrogen atoms); no more than ten hydrogen bond acceptors (nitrogen or oxygen atoms); a molecular mass less than 500 Da; and an octanol-water partition coefficient log P no greater than 5. Future Medicinal Chemistry invited a selection of leading researchers to express their views on Lipinski's Ro5, which has influenced drug design for over a decade. Their enlightening responses provide an insight into the current and future role of Ro5, and other rules of thumb, in the evolving world of medicinal chemistry.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

Style and Substance in Florentius Schuyl's Illustrations for Descartes' Treatise on Man.\nThe assumption that the Cartesian bête-machine is the invention of René Descartes (1596-1650) is rarely contested. Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

Tiemann, together with Paul Krüger (1859-1916) and then with Friedrich-Wilhelm Semmler (1860-1931), developed a method to obtain with a good yield <iVeilchenduft</i (violet scent); they condensed citral with di-methyl-ketone (acetone) thus generating an intermediate which upon exposure to an acidic environment cyclizes to ionone. By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners. While a number of chemists and pharmacists were involved in the synthesis of Ionone (<iVeilchenduft</i; violet scent) and irone (iris scent), with few exceptions, their biographies are pretty well documented. In contrast, very little transpired about Dr. Paul Krüger, who spent some seven years trying to iron out the difficulties of ionone synthesis. The purpose of this short contribution is to shed some light on the life and work of Paul Krüger while providing an overview on the status of ionone pharmacology and to highlight the historical significance of ionone synthesis.",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

These fundamental questions are not answered within the sphere of smell science; we do not know what it is about a molecule that ... smells.

The resulting measure combines 21 physicochemical features of the odorants into a single number-expressed in radians-that accurately predicts the extent of perceptual similarity between multicomponent odorant pairs. To assess the usefulness of this measure, we investigated whether we could use it to create olfactory metamers. To this end, we first identified a cut-off in the measure: pairs of multicomponent odorants that were within 0.05 radians of each other or less were very difficult to discriminate. Using this cut-off, we were able to design olfactory metamers-pairs of non-overlapping molecular compositions that generated identical odour percepts. The accurate predictions of perceptual similarity, and the ensuing creation of olfactory metamers, suggest that we have obtained a valid olfactory measure, one that may enable the digitization of smell.",

The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Due to the complexity of this ruleset a correct chemical name assignment remains challenging for human beings and there are only a few rule-based cheminformatics toolkits available that support this task in an automated manner. Here we present STOUT (SMILES-TO-IUPAC-name translator), a deep-learning neural machine translation approach to generate the IUPAC name for a given molecule from its SMILES string as well as the reverse translation, i.e. predicting the SMILES string from the IUPAC name. In both cases, the system is able to predict with an average BLEU score of about 90% and a Tanimoto similarity index of more than 0.9. Also incorrect predictions show a remarkable similarity between true and predicted compounds.",

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

A fundamental point of Rasori's therapeutic thought was represented by the dynamic action of drugs, so that a pharmacological experimentation became necessary, for medical practice. Siro Borda, who was a follower and personal friend of Rasori, made experiments on 150 substances to identify their dynamic action and, finally, he classified them in three groups: stimolanti, controstimolanti, eterocliti.

Leveraging recent breakthroughs in machine learning, we develop ChemPix: an offline, hand-drawn hydrocarbon structure recognition tool designed to remove these barriers. A neural image captioning approach consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a long short-term memory (LSTM) decoder learned a mapping from photographs of hand-drawn hydrocarbon structures to machine-readable SMILES representations. We generated a large auxiliary training dataset, based on RDKit molecular images, by combining image augmentation, image degradation and background addition. Additionally, a small dataset of ∼600 hand-drawn hydrocarbon chemical structures was crowd-sourced using a phone web application. These datasets were used to train the image-to-SMILES neural network with the goal of maximizing the hand-drawn hydrocarbon recognition accuracy. By forming a committee of the trained neural networks where each network casts one vote for the predicted molecule, we achieved a nearly 10 percentage point improvement of the molecule recognition accuracy and were able to assign a confidence value for the prediction based on the number of agreeing votes. The ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 76% on hand-drawn hydrocarbons, increasing to 86% if the top 3 predictions were considered.",

Regulatory restrictions or eco-friendly certification constraints like hexane-free processes triggered an important brainstorming in the industry.

In most cases, the NP name will be given with reference to the species of origin, be it a plant, a marine organism, a mammalian or microbial species. For a long time, the use of biologically-based trivial names has been recommended to identify the parental linkage between the product and the originating genus or species. But the recommendation is not always followed and a multiplicity of trivial names have been attributed to NP, based on locations (country, region, city), foods, music, animals, forenames, etc. Tips-and-tricks associated with the naming of NP are underlined here. Usually, NP are differentiated across a homogeneous chemical series with a letter (from the Latin or Greek alphabet), followed or not with a number. In other cases, the change of a single letter distinguishes a series of NP. Common pitfalls associated with the naming of NP are enumerated, including the complexity of names, use of synonyms, duplicated names, confusing names and inappropriate terminology. The difficulties regularly encountered with the naming of NP are discussed. Four essential recommendations are recalled: (i) a thorough analysis of the existing products to avoid duplicated names and confusion, (ii) the use of a biologically-based trivial name to retrace the origin of the product, (iii) the strict adherence to the codes of chemical nomenclature, and (iv) the preference for simple names to facilitate transmission. Naming a new NP is a rewarding task, which shall be performed with all due skill, care and diligence.",

Many natural compounds have important biological functions, and certainly many more of the ample 200,000 currently known will ultimately prove to be more than just 'secondary metabolites'. The question is how to select the most promising candidates for potential new drugs. 'Rediscovery' of known natural compounds is regarded as a nuisance or disappointment by scientists involved with the identification of novel compounds. The other side of the coin, however, is that the discovery that a particular compound occurs in unrelated species can be a valuable clue toward the identification of a novel receptor or enzyme. Here, we put forward the hypothesis that when a natural compound occurs in unrelated species, it must have an important biological function by interacting with a specific molecular target. This is because it is extremely improbable that in nature one particular compound is synthesized in totally unrelated species for no reason at all. For many compounds occurring in unrelated species, it is already known that they act on specific molecular targets. For others, it is just known that they occur in different species. In some cases, biological activities are known but not the underlying mechanisms of action. It is from this category of compounds that important discoveries are likely to be made. Some (around 70) of them were identified. They represent important clues from nature offering an alternative approach to the classical screening of large numbers of compounds.",

In Palermo, atomic-molecular theory was extensively taught and research was carried out on chemical atomicity (valence) and spatial structures of both aliphatic and aromatic organic molecules: Körner found the relative positions of substituent groups on the benzene ring, Paternò proved the equivalence of the four positions around each carbon atom. Thanks to Cannizzaro's and Paternò's efforts, a new journal, Gazzetta Chimica Italiana, was printed in Palermo. The journal collected original papers from Italian chemists, and summaries or translations of foreign ones. When Cannizzaro moved to Rome in 1872, Emanuele Paternò, the youngest of his pupils, took his place.

Although Angewandte Chemie was originally founded as a journal for applied (\"angewandte\")--technical and analytical--chemistry, numerous review articles and abstracts published even in its first 50 years enable the milestones in chemical research in a much broader sense to be traced nicely. With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two! Enjoy your time in this very special museum. -Jeffrey I. Seeman Guest Editor University of Richmond Richmond, Virginia 23173, USA E-mail: jseeman@richmond.edu. ",

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

P. Hammett's book of that title, although substantial earlier work can be traced back to the turn of the 20th century. Many of the instrumental tools that helped the discipline develop in so many different ways began to appear in the late thirties and during World War II and were soon built to be increasingly operated in the \"hands-on\" mode. This development became very popular in academia, where instruments are not operated for you by an expert, but even if you are an undergraduate, you can more or less be the expert yourself and take many varieties of data on instruments usually available on a 24 h basis. It has been my privilege and joy to begin research in chemistry just as these waves of change began to grow and to savor the great contribution that the new methods, such as measurement of (14)C, UV-vis, IR, NMR, and hands-on use of computers, made in facilitating our research programs at MIT and later at Caltech. Among those programs, which will be discussed, were (14)C tracing of carbocation rearrangements and benzyne formation, electrical effects of substituents, Grignard reagents, synthesis of small-ring compounds, (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of halogenated ethylenes, assisting in development of (19)F, (13)C, and (15)N NMR for conformational analysis, other structural, kinetic, and tracer studies, as well as helping through textbooks to bring Huckel MO theory and the elements of NMR to familiarity for organic chemists.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

For example, drawing positive and negative electrostatic isopotential surfaces partitions the molecule into regions subject to nucleophilic or electrophilic attack. Similarly, coloring isodensity surfaces to indicate the magnitude of the gradient of the electron density maps the molecule surface into regions of high and low electronegativity. A basic understanding of reaction mechanisms can also come from viewing and manipulating isovalued surfaces. A theory of molecular interactions, based upon second-order perturbation theory, provides for the decomposition of the intermolecular interaction energy into steric, electrostatic and orbital interactions. Color figures illustrate the docking of reactant molecular densities, electrostatic potentials and orbitals on low-energy pathways. The figures are used to visualize the steric, electrostatic and orbital contributions to molecular interaction energy. The visualization not only identifies low-energy reaction pathways, but it frequently reveals local interactions which determine the magnitude of the total interaction energy. Similar insight is not easily obtained by simple evaluation of the total interaction energy. Approximate transition states, built from structures along low-energy approach pathways, are excellent starting points for transition state searches.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting.

Style and Substance in Florentius Schuyl's Illustrations for Descartes' Treatise on Man.\nThe assumption that the Cartesian bête-machine is the invention of René Descartes (1596-1650) is rarely contested. Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

The aim of the opening lecture is to trace the evolution of Quantum Chemistry from the Heitler-London paper of 1927 up to the end of the last century, emphasizing concepts rather than calculations. The importance of symmetry concepts became evident in the early years: one thinks of the necessary anti-symmetry of the wave function under electron permutations, the Pauli principle, the aufbau scheme, and the classification of spectroscopic states. But for chemists perhaps the key concept is embodied in the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, which provides a pictorial interpretation of chemical bonding in terms of classical electrostatic forces exerted on the nuclei by the electron distribution. Much of the lecture is concerned with various electron distribution functions--the electron density, the current density, the spin density, and other 'property densities'--and with their use in interpreting both molecular structure and molecular properties. Other topics touched upon include Response theory and propagators; Chemical groups in molecules and the group function approach; Atoms in molecules and Bader's theory; Electron correlation and the 'pair function'. Finally, some long-standing controversies, in particular the EPR paradox, are re-examined in the context of molecular dissociation. By admitting the concept of symmetry breaking, along with the use of the von Neumann-Dirac statistical ensemble, orthodox quantum mechanics can lead to a convincing picture of the dissociation mechanism.",

A quite different approach, loosely linked to density functional theory, is based on a ground-state free atom or molecule, and equates electronegativity to the negative of an electronic chemical potential. A problem that is encountered with this approach is the differentiation of a noncontinuous function. We show that this approach leads to some results that are not chemically valid. A formulation of atomic electronegativity that does prove to be effective is to express it as the average local ionization energy on an outer contour of the atom's electronic density.",

Each group of related lines converge at a point in a negative quadrant of van Krevelen space (e.g., H/C = 4, O/C = -1). These points of convergence have H/C and O/C ratios that correspond to \"molecular formulae\" in which the stoichiometric coefficients of some of the isotopes are negative. In this manner, a group of related low-mass moieties have been identified (CH4O(-1), C4O(-3), C2H(-8)O(-1), CH(-12), etc.). Each of these moieties has a nominal mass of zero and a very small exact mass. Furthermore, all of these low-mass moieties have compositions that fall on the line H/C = -12 - 16(O/C), which lies entirely in the negative quadrants of van Krevelen space. This paper demonstrates that all low-mass moieties consisting of C, H, and O can be expressed formally as linear combinations of any two moieties. Likewise, all molecular formulae that fall on a line that passes through a given low-mass moiety must differ compositionally by a multiple of the composition of that moiety, and their exact masses must differ by a multiple of the exact mass of the moiety. This latter relationship has been invoked for very rapid assignment of a molecular formula to an exact mass. Finally, a more comprehensive and theoretically based understanding of family scores has been developed around the concept of low-mass moieties.",

Before World War II, a chemist would have relied almost exclusively on the art of chemical synthesis, primarily in the form of degradation and derivatization reactions, to develop and test structural hypotheses in a process that often took years to complete when grams of material were available. Today, a battery of advanced spectroscopic methods, such as multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry, not to mention X-ray crystallography, exist for the expeditious assignment of structures to highly complex molecules isolated from nature in milligram or sub-milligram quantities. In fact, it could be argued that the characterization of natural products has become a routine task, one which no longer even requires a reaction flask! This Review makes the case that imaginative detective work and chemical synthesis still have important roles to play in the process of solving nature's most intriguing molecular puzzles.",

Out of 210 molecular μ(0)(mol)values considered more than 150 are not even in the range min{μ(0)(at)} &lt; μ(0)(mol) &lt; max{μ(0)(at)} spanned by the μ(0)(at) = -χ(0)(at) of the constituent atoms. Thus the chemical potentials of the large majority of our molecules cannot be obtained by any electronegativity equalization scheme, including the \"geometric mean equalization principle\", ½(I(0) + A(0))(mol) = &lt;½(I(0) + A(0))(at)&gt;(GM). For this equation the root-mean-square of relative errors amounts to SE = 71%.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A population analysis of aromatic rings in various drug databases demonstrated that para substitution is favored over meta and ortho regioisomers, with p-chlorophenyl (p-ClPh) being one of the most predominant examples. We speculate that the frequency of p-ClPh is traced back to historical models of medicinal chemistry where para-substituted regioisomers were perhaps more easily accessed, and further reinforced by Topliss in 1972 that if Ph was active, the p-ClPh should be made because of ease of synthesis and hydrophobicity driven potency effects. On the basis of our analysis, the para bias has become useful conventional wisdom but perhaps so much so that a perception has been created that druglike space favors a linear aromatic structure. It is hoped this analysis will catalyze a new look at design of reagent databases and screening collections. ",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting.

Style and Substance in Florentius Schuyl's Illustrations for Descartes' Treatise on Man.\nThe assumption that the Cartesian bête-machine is the invention of René Descartes (1596-1650) is rarely contested. Close examination of Descartes' texts proves that this is a concept founded not on the basis of his own writings, but a subsequent critical interpretation, which developed and began to dominate his work after his death. Descartes' Treatise on Man, published posthumously in two rival editions, Florentius Schuyl's Latin translation De Homine (1662), and Claude Clerselier's Traité de l'homme, has proved particularly problematic. The surviving manuscript copies of the Treatise on Man left no illustrations, leaving both editors the daunting task of producing a set of images to accompany and clarify the fragmented text. In this intriguing case, the images can be seen to have spoken louder than the text which they illustrated. This paper assesses Schuyl's choice to represent Descartes' Man in a highly stylized manner, without superimposing Clerselier's intentions onto De Homine.",

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals.

For example, drawing positive and negative electrostatic isopotential surfaces partitions the molecule into regions subject to nucleophilic or electrophilic attack. Similarly, coloring isodensity surfaces to indicate the magnitude of the gradient of the electron density maps the molecule surface into regions of high and low electronegativity. A basic understanding of reaction mechanisms can also come from viewing and manipulating isovalued surfaces. A theory of molecular interactions, based upon second-order perturbation theory, provides for the decomposition of the intermolecular interaction energy into steric, electrostatic and orbital interactions. Color figures illustrate the docking of reactant molecular densities, electrostatic potentials and orbitals on low-energy pathways. The figures are used to visualize the steric, electrostatic and orbital contributions to molecular interaction energy. The visualization not only identifies low-energy reaction pathways, but it frequently reveals local interactions which determine the magnitude of the total interaction energy. Similar insight is not easily obtained by simple evaluation of the total interaction energy. Approximate transition states, built from structures along low-energy approach pathways, are excellent starting points for transition state searches.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Some industries have publicly reported at least some degree of information regarding their PFAS use, while other industries have reported little, if any, such information publicly. Publicly available sources were extensively researched for information. Literature searches were performed on key words via a variety of search mechanisms, including existing PFAS use and synthesis literature, patent databases, manufacturers' websites, public government databases, and library catalogs. Additional searches were conducted specifically for suspected or known uses. PFAS have been used in a wide variety of applications, which are summarized into several industries and applications. The expanded literature search yielded additional references as well as greater details, such as concentrations and specific PFAS used, on several previously reported uses. This knowledge will help inform which industries and occupations may lead to potential exposure to workers and to the environment.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Jmol is a widely used open-source molecular visualization and analysis tool written in Java and implemented in both Java and JavaScript. Over the past 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, work on Jmol has included the development of dialects of SMILES and SMARTS that incorporate novel aspects that allow new and powerful applications. The specifications of \"Jmol SMILES\" and \"Jmol SMARTS\" are described. The dialects most closely resemble OpenSMILES and OpenSMARTS. Jmol SMILES is a superset of OpenSMILES, allowing a freer format, including whitespace and comments, the addition of \"processing directives\" that modify the meaning of certain aspects of SMILES processing such as aromaticity and stereochemistry, a more extensive treatment of stereochemistry, and several minor additions. Jmol SMARTS similarly adds these same modifications to OpenSMARTS, but also adds a number of additional \"primitives\" and elements of syntax tuned to matching 3D molecular structures and selecting their atoms. The result is an expansion of the capabilities of SMILES and SMARTS primarily for use in 3D molecular analysis, allowing a broader range of matching involving any combination of 3D molecular structures, SMILES strings, and SMARTS patterns. While developed specifically for Jmol, these dialects of SMILES and SMARTS are independent of the Jmol application itself. Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS add value to standard SMILES and SMARTS. Together they have proven exceptionally capable in extracting valuable information from 3D structural models, as demonstrated in Jmol. Capabilities in Jmol enabled by Jmol SMILES and Jmol SMARTS include efficient MMFF94 atom typing, conformational identification, SMILES comparisons without canonicalization, identification of stereochemical relationships, quantitative comparison of 3D structures from different sources (including differences in Kekulization), conformational flexible fitting, and atom mapping used to synchronize interactive displays of 2D structures, 3D structures, and spectral correlations, where data are being drawn from multiple sources.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

At the age of twenty-one, Sertürner was the first to report on some results concerning the substance which was thought to be responsible as the \"sleeping-agent\". This substance had been isolated by him from the poppy-plant. Since this first report remained unnoticed, he repeated his analysis and described once more on the \"crystallizable\" properties of the agent in 1817, which he now named morphine. To have an idea of the effects of the drug, Sertürner was able to confirm the hypnotic as well as the analgesic properties of morphine that were well-known to him since the had performed animal tests. Since he could demonstrate the alkaline qualities of morphine, something absolutely new at that time, Sertürner became the co-founder and promoter of a new type of chemistry now known as alkaloid chemistry.",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

In each spectrum the terahertz resonances correspond to wagging, rocking, or twisting of the quinacridone rings, with the most intense absorption being an in-plane rocking vibration of the carbonyl oxygens. In spite of these spectral similarities, we demonstrate that terahertz measurements readily differentiate β-quinacridone, γ-quinacridone, and 2,9-dimethylquinacridone. The spectrum of β-quinacridone has a group of closely spaced modes at ∼4 THz, whereas in contrast the spectrum of γ-quinacridone displays a widely spaced series of modes spread over the range ∼1-5 THz. Both of these have the strongest mode at ∼9 THz, whereas in contrast 2,9-dimethylquinacridone exhibits the strongest mode at ∼7 THz.

Our method is based on the fragmentation of SMILES strings into overlapping substrings of a defined size that we call LINGOs. The integral set of LINGOs derived from a given SMILES string, the LINGO profile, is a hologram of the SMILES representation of the molecule described. LINGO profiles provide input for QSPR models and the calculation of intermolecular similarities at very low computational cost. The octanol/water partition coefficient (LlogP) QSPR model achieved a correlation coefficient R2=0.93, a root-mean-square error RRMS=0.49 log units, a goodness of prediction correlation coefficient Q2=0.89 and a QRMS=0.61 log units.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Within short reaction time (15 min) under ultrasonic irradiation, compared to normal laboratory conditions, (4-16 h), we can achieve good to excellent yields. The reaction time is shortened because ultrasound can accelerate the generation of the nucleophile of the pyridinium salt and subsequently a nucleophilic addition of an aldehyde followed by dehydration affords the styrylpyridinium dye, (Knoevenagel condensation). The photophysical properties of all compounds are comprehensively investigated in different solvents. All the compounds exhibit negative solvatochromism both in absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. Such behavior is due to the higher dipole moment of these molecules at the ground state.

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

I show that such lines of thinking may answer some questions, or at least pose the right questions. Most importantly, I draw links and comparisons as to how better understanding of how small (10's of atoms) molecules can interact so specially with large (10,000's of atoms) proteins in a way that is so integral to healthy living.

Gilbert explores the sudden emergence of happiness as a discipline, reviews the major findings (including the mistakes we all make in predicting how happy or miserable we'll be), and examines the role of happiness in productivity on the job. He describes what makes us truly happy-it's not a promotion or a new house-and sketches out a \"happiness diet\" that emphasizes small, routine efforts. Looking forward, Gilbert discusses the breakthrough work of his colleague Matthew Killingsworth, whose iPhoneenabled real-time surveys of people's moods are providing an ultra-high-resolution picture of how our emotional states shift from minute to minute. A sidebar by Killingsworth offers a preliminary look at his findings and their implications for our personal and workplace lives.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

This episode illustrated his preference for mathematical models over verbal ones, and the generosity with which he could change his mind. Even after accepting that some signals are reliable because of their strategic costs, he argued for a pluralistic approach to signal reliability. Signal complexity was a developing interest when he died. Signals usually involve several components, some of which appear to amplify other signal components. The terms \"amplifier\" and \"index\" require more thought to reduce the scope for semantic confusion. I conclude by describing Maynard Smith's fascination with peacocks Pavo cristatus.",

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Even more recent work has shown that if a communication system maximizes communicative efficiency while minimizing the cost of communication, or if a communication system constrains ambiguity in a non-trivial way while a certain entropy is maximized, signal frequencies will be distributed according to Zipf's law. Here we show that such communication principles give rise not only to signals that have many traits in common with the linking words in real human languages, but also to a rudimentary sort of syntax and symbolic reference.",

Participants also rated the same pieces using bipolar verbal scales which aimed to encompass the concepts represented by the icons (e.g., the word \"red\" for the colour red). Furthermore, the icons themselves were subjected to open-ended verbal labelling to validate the icon scale. Colour icons spontaneously evoked a cross-modal association on 67% of occasions: blue being cool, and red/orange being warm or hot, and the icon scale had overall good face validity. Music regularly and consistently evoked multisensory associations (using the icon scale) including shapes, colours, weight, and temperatures, in addition to emotions. Cross-modal perception is indicative of music's character rather than the enjoyment of the music.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

By doing so the fragrance chemistry was born. Ionone (the compound responsible for the violet scent) was produced on an industrial scale at the factory of Wilhelm Haarmann (1847-1931) in Holzminden, factory renamed 1876 Haarmann &amp; Reimer, after Karl Reimer (1845-1881) joined the group of owners.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings.

Its inventor, Ernest Fourneau, began his career as a pharmaceutical chemist in organic chemistry laboratories in Germany, where from 1899 to 1901 he discovered how basic research could benefit from the modern chemistry theories which had developed in Germany starting in the 1860s. Using the complex structure of cocaine, he invented an original molecule, with comparable activity, but less toxic. The knowledge and the know-how which he acquired in Germany nourished his reflection in the field of the chemistry of the relationships between structure and activity, and led him to the development of Stovaïne. Emile Roux, Director of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was interested in his work and invited him to head the first French therapeutic chemistry laboratory, in which research on medicinal chemistry was organised scientifically. The industrial development of new medicines resulting from the Pasteur Institute's therapeutic chemistry laboratory was supported by the Etablissements Poulenc frères, France thus gaining international reputation in the domain of pharmaceutical chemistry.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Historians of science have usually focused on the chemical aspects of the alkahest, taking into account especially the claims that it was a substance capable of dissolving all kinds of matter. This paper shows the medical implications of the alkahest: it was not only a \"solvent,\" but an important means of revealing nature's secrets and of producing medicines. The properties ascribed to the alkahest fit perfectly within Helmontian theories about matter, disease, and cure.",

A C═N imine bond presents the unique properties of being strong, as expected for a covalent double bond, and of being reversible due to a fast hydrolytic process. In view of such features, Schiff base condensations are thermodynamically controlled, which, in the case of reactions involving multifunctional aldehydes and primary amines, allow the formation of complex and sophisticated structures through a trial-and-error mechanism. Back hydrolysis can be prevented by hydrogenating C═N bonds under mild conditions. In such a way, stable rings and cages of varying sizes can be synthesized. Moreover, transition and post-transition metal ions, establishing coordinative interactions with imine nitrogen atoms, can address Schiff base condensations of even more complex molecular systems, whose structure is controlled by the geometrical preferences of the metal. Metal template Schiff base condensations have produced multinuclear metal complexes exhibiting the shape of tetrahedral containers, of double helices, and, supreme wonder, of the Borromean rings. These molecular objects cannot be compared to the masterpieces of painting and sculpture of the macroscopic world, but they instill in the viewer aesthetical pleasure and admiration for their creators.",

It also applies to writing systems: more frequent words tend to be encoded by less complex graphemes, even when grapheme complexity is decoupled from word length. This study documents an exception to this law of abbreviation. Observing European heraldic motifs, whose frequency of use was documented for the whole continent and over two large corpora (total N = 25115), one medieval, one early modern, we found that they do not obey a robust law of abbreviation. In our early modern corpus, motif complexity and motif frequency are positively, not negatively, correlated, a result driven by iconic motifs. In both our corpora, iconic motifs tend to be more frequent when more complex. They grew in popularity after the invention of printing. Our results suggest that lacking iconicity may be a precondition for a graphic code to exhibit Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.",

Second, they're compressible. GIF files are generally compressed at 5:1, JPEG at 10:1 or 20:1 and PNG at about 7:1. Finally, they're all supported by web browsers. Well, pretty much. Microsoft's Internet Explorer doesn't support the alpha channel transparency for PNG-but, on the other hand, GIF and JPEG don't have the alpha channel at all.

They were first described over 60 years ago, and their range of biological activities, including antiinsectan, antifungal, antibiotic and cytotoxic, drives contemporary interest. To date, 29 enniatins have been isolated and characterized, either as a single compound or mixtures of inseparable homologs. Structurally, these depsipeptides are biosynthesized by a multifunctional enzyme, termed enniatin synthetase, and are composed of six residues that alternate between N-methyl amino acids and hydroxy acids. Their structure elucidation can be challenging, particularly for enniatins isolated as inseparable homologs; however, several strategies and tools have been utilized to solve these problems. Currently, there is one drug that has been developed from a mixture of enniatins, fusafungine, which is used as a topical treatment of upper respiratory tract infections by oral and/or nasal inhalation. Given the range of biological activities observed for this class of compounds, research on enniatins will likely continue. This review strives to digest the past studies, as well as, describe tools and techniques that can be utilized to overcome the challenges associated with the structure elucidation of mixtures of enniatin homologs.",

Onychine and its analogs exhibit a wide range of pharmacological activities such as antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antimalarial. Because of the high bioactivity of some 4-azafluorenone derivatives, several synthetic methods have been developed for their procurement. Considering the importance of these alkaloids, we aim to present the main synthetic approaches to onychines and its derivatives and the biological activity of some 4-azafluorenones. The most prominent methodologies for the synthesis of onychines were reviewed. In this work, we cover many synthetic approaches for the synthesis of onychine and 4-azafluorenone derivatives including intramolecular cyclizations, multicomponent reactions, microwave-assisted multicomponent reactions, Diels-alder reactions, among others. Moreover, we also review the biological activity of 4-azafluorenones. 4-azafluorenones have risen as prominent structures in medicinal chemistry; however, most of the time, access to new derivatives involves toxic catalysts, harsh reaction conditions, and long-step procedures. Therefore, the development of new synthetic routes with more operational simplicity, simple purification procedure, good yields, and low environmental impact, is desirable.",

The majority of these alkaloids are biologically active, with some exhibiting excellent antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and antiplasmodial activities. Consequently, the natural products of this class have attracted considerable attention as potential leads for novel therapeutics and are routinely isolated, characterized, and profiled to gauge their biological potential. However, data on indole alkaloids, their various structures, and bioactivities are complex due to their diverse sources, such as plants, fungi, bacteria, sponges, tunicates, and bryozoans; thus, isolation methods produce an incredible trove of information. The situation is exacerbated when synthetic derivatives, as well as their structures, bioactivities, and synthetic schemes, are considered. Thus, to make such data comprehensive and inform researchers about the current field's state, this review summarizes recent reports on novel indole alkaloids. It deals with the isolation and characterization of 250 novel indole alkaloids, a reappraisal of previously reported compounds, and total syntheses of indole alkaloids.

These fundamental questions are not answered within the sphere of smell science; we do not know what it is about a molecule that ... smells. I report, here, the status quo theories for olfaction, highlighting what we do not know, and explaining why dismissing the perception of the input as 'too subjective' acts as a roadblock not conducive to scientific inquiry. I outline the current and new theory that conjectures a mechanism for signal transduction based on quantum mechanical phenomena, dubbed the 'swipe card', which is perhaps controversial but feasible. I show that such lines of thinking may answer some questions, or at least pose the right questions. Most importantly, I draw links and comparisons as to how better understanding of how small (10's of atoms) molecules can interact so specially with large (10,000's of atoms) proteins in a way that is so integral to healthy living.

Looking forward, Gilbert discusses the breakthrough work of his colleague Matthew Killingsworth, whose iPhoneenabled real-time surveys of people's moods are providing an ultra-high-resolution picture of how our emotional states shift from minute to minute.

This research presents a new illusion which is similar to that identified in the Mona Lisa; La Bella Principessa's mouth appears to change slant depending on both the Viewing Distance and the Level of Blur applied to a digital version of the portrait. Through a series of psychophysics experiments, it was found that a perceived change in the slant of the La Bella Principessa's mouth influences her expression of contentment thus generating an illusion that we have coined the \"uncatchable smile\". The elusive quality of the Mona Lisa's smile has been previously reported (Science, 290 (2000) 1299) and so the existence of a similar illusion in a portrait painted prior to the Mona Lisa becomes more interesting. The question remains whether Leonardo da Vinci intended this illusion. In any case, it can be argued that the ambiguity created adds to the portrait's allure.",

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

The InChI aims to provide a unique, or canonical, identifier for chemical structures, while SMILES strings are widely used for storage and interchange of chemical structures, but no standard exists to generate a canonical SMILES string. I describe how to use the InChI canonicalisation to derive a canonical SMILES string in a straightforward way, either incorporating the InChI normalisations (Inchified SMILES) or not (Universal SMILES). This is the first description of a method to generate canonical SMILES that takes stereochemistry into account. When tested on the 1.1 m compounds in the ChEMBL database, and a 1 m compound subset of the PubChem Substance database, no canonicalisation failures were found with Inchified SMILES. Using Universal SMILES, 99.79% of the ChEMBL database was canonicalised successfully and 99.77% of the PubChem subset. The InChI canonicalisation algorithm can successfully be used as the basis for a common standard for canonical SMILES. While challenges remain - such as the development of a standard aromatic model for SMILES - the ability to create the same SMILES using different toolkits will mean that for the first time it will be possible to easily compare the chemical models used by different toolkits.",

Background and dissymmetry.\nLouis Pasteur resolved sodium ammonium (±)-tartrate in 1848, thereby discovering molecular chirality. Although hindered by the primitive state of organic chemistry, he introduced new terminology and nomenclature for his new science of molecular and crystal chirality. He was well prepared for this task by his rigorous education and innate abilities, and his linguistic achievements eventually earned him membership in the supreme institution for the French language, the Académie française. Dissymmetry had been in use in French from the early 1820s for disruption or absence of symmetry or for dissimilarity or difference in appearance between two objects, and Pasteur initially used it in the latter connotation, without any reference to handedness or enantiomorphism. Soon, however, he adopted it in the meaning of chirality. Asymmetry had been in use in French since 1691 but Pasteur ignored it in favor of dissymmetry. The two terms are not synonymous but it is not clear whether Pasteur recognized this difference in choosing the former over the latter. However, much of the literature mistranslates his dissymmetry as asymmetry. Twenty years before Pasteur the British polymath John Herschel proposed that optical rotation in the noncrystalline state is due to the \"unsymmetrical\" [his term] nature of the molecules and later used dissymmetrical for handed. Chirality, coined by Lord Kelvin in 1894 and introduced into chemistry by Mislow in 1962, has nearly completely replaced dissymmetry in the meaning of handedness, but the use of dissymmetry continues today in other contexts for lack of symmetry, reduction of symmetry, or dissimilarity.",

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Smith III, the Rhodes-Thompson Professor of Chemistry and Member of the Monell Chemical Senses Center at the University of Pennsylvania, has mentored well over 100 doctoral and masters students, more than 200 postdoctoral associates and numerous undergraduates, in addition to collaborating with a wide spectrum of internationally recognized scholars. His research interests, broadly stated, comprise complex molecule synthesis, the development of new, versatile and highly effective synthetic methods, bioorganic and medicinal chemistry, peptide mimicry chemistry and material science. Each area demands a high level of synthetic design and execution. United by a passion to unlock the secrets of organic synthesis, and perhaps of Nature itself, innumerable lessons have been, and continue to be, learned by the members of the Smith Group. This lead article in a Special Issue of the Journal of Antibiotics affords an opportunity to share some of those lessons learned, albeit a small selection of personal favorites.",

The study was extended to 3-(2-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-amine derivatives, which lack an appropriate ipso leaving group. Here, efficient cyclisations resulted in displacement of the methoxy group and formation of tetrahydroquinolines.",

However, aromaticity is not an unambiguous term; therefore, its definition is enumerative. The criteria are based on energy (increased stability), molecular geometry (very low bond lengths alternation), magnetism (induction of the diatropic ring current by external magnetic field) and reactivity (tendency to maintain π-electron structure in chemical reactions). The energetic criterion is based on resonance energy and aromatic stabilization energy, whereas harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity-on molecular geometry. Magnetism-based criteria are illustrated by local indicators (for individual rings): nucleus independent chemical shifts and proton nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts as well as the global aromaticity index-exaltation of the magnetic susceptibility. For selected homo- and hetero-cyclic compounds, illustrative data are presented in tables, which allow the comparison of the above-mentioned indices. Finally, examples of agreements or disagreements between these various aromaticity indices are presented for few representative cases.",

The yaInChI theme is applicable for checking the structural identity with higher sensitivity and generating three-dimensional (3-D) structures from the one-dimensional (1-D) string with less ambiguity than the general InChI method. The modifications to yaInChI provide non-rotatable single bonds, stereochemistry of organometallic compounds, allene and cumulene, and parity of atoms with a lone pair. Additionally, yaInChI better preserves the original information of the given input file (SDF) using the protonation information, hydrogen count +1, and original bond type, which are not considered or restrictively considered in InChI and SMILES. When yaInChI is used to perform a duplication check on a 3D chemical structure database, Ligand.Info, it shows more discriminating power than InChI. The structural information provided by yaInChI is in a compact format, making it a promising solution for handling large chemical structure databases.",
