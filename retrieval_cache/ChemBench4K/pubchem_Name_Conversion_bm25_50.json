Upon oral administration, ozanimod selectively targets and binds to S1PR1 on lymphocytes and induces S1PR1 internalization and degradation. This results in the sequestration of lymphocytes in lymph nodes. By preventing egress of lymphocytes, ozanimod reduces both the amount of circulating peripheral lymphocytes and the infiltration of lymphocytes into target tissues. This prevents a lymphocyte-mediated immune response and may reduce inflammation. S1PR1, a G-protein coupled receptor, plays a key role in lymphocyte migration from lymphoid tissues. Modulation of S1PR5 by ozanimod may be neuroprotective.",

Upon administration, ifetroban targets and binds to TxA2 and PGH2 receptors, thereby preventing the activity of both TxA2 and PGH2 and disrupting their downstream signaling pathways. This prevents platelet activation, aggregation and thrombosis. It also prevents vascular constriction and causes vasodilation. In addition, as cancer cells use platelets to metastasize to different parts of the body, ifetroban can reduce the stickiness of the platelets and prevent metastasis. TxA2 causes vascular contraction and platelet activation.']",

On June 15, 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval and orphan drug designation to lurbinectedin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC who have experienced disease progression despite therapy with platinum-based agents.

The CDF family contains 135 individual compounds (known as congeners) with varying harmful health and environmental effects. Of these 135 compounds, those that contain chlorine atoms at the 2,3,7,8-positions of the parent dibenzofuran molecule are especially harmful. Other than for laboratory use of small amounts of CDFs for research and development purposes, these chemicals are not deliberately produced by industry. Most CDFs are produced in very small amounts as unwanted impurities of certain products and processes utilizing chlorinated compounds. Only a few of the 135 CDF compounds have been produced in large enough quantities so that their properties, such as color, smell, taste, and toxicity could be studied. (L952)",
