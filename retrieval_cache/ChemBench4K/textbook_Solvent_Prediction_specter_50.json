Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with $\\sum$ representing \"the sum of\" and $n$ standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:\n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text {reaction }}^{\\circ}=\\sum n \\times \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}(\\text { products })-\\sum n \\times \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}(\\text { reactants })\n$$\n\nThe following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest.\n\nEXAMPLE 9.15",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry's law.",

Notice that the triple point is well above 1 atm, indicating that carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid under ambient pressure conditions. Instead, cooling gaseous carbon dioxide at 1 atm results in its deposition into the solid state.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place.

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the hydrogen would yield\n\n$$\n\\text { mol } \\mathrm{HCl} \\text { produced }=3 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\times \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}}{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2}}=6 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}\n$$\n\nComplete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce\n\n$$\n\\text { mol } \\mathrm{HCl} \\text { produced }=2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \\times \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}}{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=4 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}\n$$\n\nThe chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced. Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl , there will be unreacted hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant (Figure 7.14).\n\n\nFIGURE 7.14 When $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ are combined in nonstoichiometric amounts, one of these reactants will limit the amount of HCl that can be produced. This illustration shows a reaction in which hydrogen is present in excess and chlorine is the limiting reactant.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Because the direct hydration of alkenes with aqueous acid is generally a poor reaction in the laboratory, two indirect methods are commonly used. Hydroboration-oxidation yields the syn, non-Markovnikov hydration product (Section 8.5), whereas oxymercuration-demercuration yields the Markovnikov hydration product (Section 8.4).\n\n- 1,2-Diols can be prepared either by direct hydroxylation of an alkene with $\\mathrm{OsO}_{4}$ followed by reduction with $\\mathrm{NaHSO}_{3}$ or by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an epoxide (Section 8.7).

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Therefore, $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ is expected to have the lowest boiling point and $\\mathrm{SnH}_{4}$ the highest boiling point. The ordering from lowest to highest boiling point is expected to be $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}<\\mathrm{SiH}_{4}<\\mathrm{GeH}_{4}<$ $\\mathrm{SnH}_{4}$.\n\nA graph of the actual boiling points of these compounds versus the period of the group 14 element shows this prediction to be correct:",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low. As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {methanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ethanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {propanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {butanol }}$.\n\nAs temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, $K E$, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

What would happen, though, if we were to carry out the reaction on a single enantiomer of a chiral reactant? For example, what stereochemical result would be obtained from addition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to a chiral alkene, such as $(R)$-4-methyl-1-hexene? The product of the reaction, 4-methyl-2-hexanol, has two chirality centers and so has four possible stereoisomers.\n\n\nLet's think about the two chirality centers separately. What about the configuration at C4, the methyl-bearing carbon atom? Since C 4 has the $R$ configuration in the starting material and this chirality center is unaffected by the reaction, its configuration is unchanged. Thus, the configuration at C 4 in the product remains $R$ (assuming that the relative rankings of the four attached groups are not changed by the reaction).\n\nWhat about the configuration at C2, the newly formed chirality center? As shown in FIGURE 8.14, the stereochemistry at C 2 is established by reaction of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ with a carbocation intermediate in the usual manner. But this carbocation doesn't have a plane of symmetry; it is chiral because of the chirality center at C4. Because the carbocation is chiral and has no plane of symmetry, it doesn't react equally well from the top and bottom faces. One of the two faces is likely, for steric reasons, to be a bit more accessible than the other, leading to a mixture of $R$ and $S$ products in some ratio other than $50: 50$. Thus, two diastereomeric products, ( $2 R, 4 R$ )-4-methyl-2-hexanol and ( $2 S, 4 R$ )-4-methyl-2-hexanol, are formed in unequal amounts, and the mixture is optically active.",

The reaction is favored when carried out with an unhindered substrate and a negatively charged nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, but is disfavored when carried out with a hindered substrate and a neutral nucleophile in a protic solvent. You might therefore expect the reaction of a tertiary substrate (hindered) with water (neutral, protic) to be among the slowest of substitution reactions. Remarkably, however, the opposite is true.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

Many organic reactions occur in several steps, one of which usually has a higher-energy transition state than the others and is therefore slower.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Sulfur Oxyacids and Salts - \nThe preparation of sulfuric acid, $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ (shown in Figure 18.54), begins with the oxidation of sulfur to sulfur trioxide and then converting the trioxide to sulfuric acid. Pure sulfuric acid is a colorless, oily liquid that freezes at $10.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. It fumes when heated because the acid decomposes to water and sulfur trioxide. The heating process causes the loss of more sulfur trioxide than water, until reaching a concentration of $98.33 \\%$ acid.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Rates usually increase when the concentration of one or more of the reactants increases. For example, calcium carbonate $\\left(\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\\right)$ deteriorates as a result of its reaction with the pollutant sulfur dioxide. The rate of this reaction depends on the amount of sulfur dioxide in the air (Figure 17.7). An acidic oxide, sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor in the air to produce sulfurous acid in the following reaction:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}(a q)\n$$\n\nCalcium carbonate reacts with sulfurous acid as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(s)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CaSO}_{3}(a q)+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)\n$$\n\nIn a polluted atmosphere where the concentration of sulfur dioxide is high, calcium carbonate deteriorates more rapidly than in less polluted air. Similarly, phosphorus burns much more rapidly in an atmosphere of pure oxygen than in air, which is only about $20 \\%$ oxygen.\n\n\nFIGURE 17.7 Statues made from carbonate compounds such as limestone and marble typically weather slowly over time due to the actions of water, and thermal expansion and contraction. However, pollutants like sulfur dioxide can accelerate weathering. As the concentration of air pollutants increases, deterioration of limestone occurs more rapidly. (credit: James P Fisher III)",

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Mixtures of these two substances will form two separate layers with the less dense oil floating on top of the water.

Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine layer (Figure 11.15).\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Bromine (the deep orange liquid on the left) and water (the clear liquid in the middle) are partially miscible.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Chemistry in Context\nChemistry deals with the composition, structure, and properties of matter, and the ways by which various forms of matter may be interconverted. Thus, it occupies a central place in the study and practice of science and technology. Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Limiting Reactant - \nAn alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant. Each reactant amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per the reaction's stoichiometry. The reactant yielding the lesser amount of product is the limiting reactant. For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the hydrogen would yield\n\n$$\n\\text { mol } \\mathrm{HCl} \\text { produced }=3 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\times \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}}{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2}}=6 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}\n$$\n\nComplete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce\n\n$$\n\\text { mol } \\mathrm{HCl} \\text { produced }=2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \\times \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}}{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=4 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}\n$$\n\nThe chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced. Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl , there will be unreacted hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant (Figure 7.14).\n\n\nFIGURE 7.14 When $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ are combined in nonstoichiometric amounts, one of these reactants will limit the amount of HCl that can be produced.

When reactants are in different physical states, or phases (solid, liquid, gaseous, dissolved), the reaction takes place only at the interface between the phases. Consider the heterogeneous reaction between a solid phase and either a liquid or gaseous phase.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

All chemical reactions, whether they take place in the laboratory or in living organisms, follow the same \"rules.\" Reactions in living organisms often look more complex than laboratory reactions because of the size of the biomolecules and the involvement of biological catalysts called enzymes, but the principles governing all chemical reactions are the same.\n\nTo understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we'll start with an overview of the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we'll see why reactions occur, and we'll see how reactions can be described. Once this\nbackground is out of the way, we'll then be ready to begin studying the details of organic chemistry in future chapters.\n\nWhen first approached, organic chemistry might seem overwhelming. It's not so much that any one part is difficult to understand, it's that there are so many parts: tens of millions of compounds, dozens of functional groups, and an apparently endless number of reactions. With study, though, it becomes evident that there are only a few fundamental ideas that underlie all organic reactions. Far from being a collection of isolated facts, organic chemistry is a beautifully logical subject that is unified by a few broad themes. When these themes are understood, learning organic chemistry becomes much easier and memorization is minimized. The aim of this book is to describe the themes and clarify the patterns that unify organic chemistry in future chapters.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Yet calcium reacts at a moderate rate, whereas sodium reacts so rapidly that the reaction is almost explosive.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

When reactants are in different physical states, or phases (solid, liquid, gaseous, dissolved), the reaction takes place only at the interface between the phases. Consider the heterogeneous reaction between a solid phase and either a liquid or gaseous phase. Compared with the reaction rate for large solid particles, the rate for smaller particles will be greater because the surface area in contact with the other reactant phase is greater. For example, large pieces of iron react more slowly with acids than they do with finely divided iron powder (Figure 17.6).

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

The rate law is:\n\n$$\n\\text { rate }=k\\left[\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right]^{2}[\\mathrm{CO}]^{0}=k\\left[\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right]^{2}\n$$\n\nRemember that a number raised to the zero power is equal to 1 , thus $[\\mathrm{CO}]^{0}=1$, which is why the CO concentration term may be omitted from the rate law: the rate of reaction is solely dependent on the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$. A later chapter section on reaction mechanisms will explain how a reactant's concentration can have no effect on a reaction rate despite being involved in the reaction.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Both factors minimize the crystal lattice energy and disfavor formation of the solid. Typical cations are quaternary ammonium ions from heterocyclic amines, either 1,3-dialkylimidazolium ions, $N$-alkylpyridinium ions, or ring-substituted $N$-alkylpyridinium ions.\n\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\mathrm{R}= & -\\mathrm{CH}_{3},-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{3},-\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{3}, \\\\\n& -\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{CH}_{3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n1,3-Dialkylimidazolium ions",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The sudden appearance was due to a supernova explosion, which was much brighter than the original star. Even though this supernova was observed almost a millennium ago, the remaining Crab Nebula (Figure 3.1) continues to release energy today. It emits not only visible light but also infrared light, X-rays, and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The nebula emits both continuous spectra (the blue-white glow) and atomic emission spectra (the colored\nfilaments). In this chapter, we will discuss light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation and how they are related to the electronic structure of atoms. We will also see how this radiation can be used to identify elements, even from thousands of light years away.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same.

Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry's law.",

The molecules within a liquid are surrounded by other molecules and are attracted equally in all directions by the cohesive forces within the liquid. However, the molecules on the surface of a liquid are attracted only by about one-half as many molecules. Because of the unbalanced molecular attractions on the surface molecules, liquids contract to form a shape that minimizes the number of molecules on the surface-that is, the shape with the minimum surface area. A small drop of liquid tends to assume a spherical shape, as shown in Figure 10.16, because in a sphere, the ratio of surface area to volume is at a minimum. Larger drops are more greatly affected by gravity, air resistance, surface interactions, and so on, and as a result, are less spherical.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.16 Attractive forces result in a spherical water drop that minimizes surface area; cohesive forces hold the sphere together; adhesive forces keep the drop attached to the web.

They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles (Figure 11.28). In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the actual concentrations. Note that the van't Hoff factors for the electrolytes in Table 11.3 are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of $i$ for NaCl is 1.9 , as opposed to an ideal value of 2 .\n\n\nFIGURE 11.28 Dissociation of ionic compounds in water is not always complete due to the formation of ion pairs.",

The Formation of Solutions - \nFIGURE 11.4 This schematic representation of dissolution shows a stepwise process involving the endothermic separation of solute and solvent species (Steps 1 and 2) and exothermic solvation (Step 3).\n\nConsider the example of an ionic compound dissolving in water. Formation of the solution requires the electrostatic forces between the cations and anions of the compound (solute-solute) be overcome completely as attractive forces are established between these ions and water molecules (solute-solvent). Hydrogen bonding between a relatively small fraction of the water molecules must also be overcome to accommodate any dissolved solute. If the solute's electrostatic forces are significantly greater than the solvation forces, the dissolution process is significantly endothermic and the compound may not dissolve to an appreciable extent. Calcium carbonate, the major component of coral reefs, is one example of such an \"insoluble\" ionic compound (see Figure 11.1). On the other hand, if the solvation forces are much stronger than the compound's electrostatic forces, the dissolution is significantly exothermic and the compound may be highly soluble. A common example of this type of ionic compound is sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this module, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by exothermic dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the release of heat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate $\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3}\\right)$ is one such example and is used to make instant cold packs, like the one pictured in Figure 11.5, which are used for treating injuries. A thin-walled plastic bag of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid $\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3}$. When the smaller bag is broken, a solution of $\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated, but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies formation of the solution.",

Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric methods for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter).\n\nThe extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is provided in a later chapter on solutions. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that\nhave been observed for many ionic compounds (Table 7.1).",

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Because $\\mathbf{B}$ forms faster than $\\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{B}$ is the major product. It doesn't matter that $\\mathbf{C}$ is more stable than B, because the two are not in equilibrium. The product of an irreversible reaction depends only on relative rates, not on stability. Such reactions are said to be under kinetic control.\n\n\nNow let's carry out the same reaction at some higher temperature so that both processes are readily reversible and an equilibrium is reached. Because $\\mathbf{C}$ is more stable than $\\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}$ is the major product obtained. It doesn't matter that $\\mathbf{C}$ forms more slowly than $\\mathbf{B}$, because the two are in equilibrium. The product of a readily reversible reaction depends only on stability, not on relative rates. Such reactions are said to be under equilibrium control, or thermodynamic control.\n\n\nWe can now explain the effect of temperature on the electrophilic addition reactions of conjugated dienes. At low temperature $\\left(0^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$, HBr adds to 1,3-butadiene under kinetic control to give a $71: 29$ mixture of products, with the more rapidly formed 1,2 adduct predominating. Because these low-temperature conditions don't allow the reaction to reach equilibrium, the product that forms faster predominates. At higher temperature $\\left(40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\\right)$, however, the reaction occurs under thermodynamic control to give a $15: 85$ mixture of products, with the more stable 1,4 adduct predominating. The higher temperature allows the addition process to become reversible, so an equilibrium mixture of products results. FIGURE 14.7 shows this situation in an energy diagram.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same.

Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

(credit: \"dno1967\"/Wikimedia commons)\n\nMiscible liquids are typically those with very similar polarities. Consider, for example, liquids that are polar or capable of hydrogen bonding. For such liquids, the dipole-dipole attractions (or hydrogen bonding) of the solute molecules with the solvent molecules are at least as strong as those between molecules in the pure solute or in the pure solvent. Hence, the two kinds of molecules mix easily. Likewise, nonpolar liquids are miscible with each other because there is no appreciable difference in the strengths of solute-solute, solventsolvent, and solute-solvent intermolecular attractions. The solubility of polar molecules in polar solvents and of nonpolar molecules in nonpolar solvents is, again, an illustration of the chemical axiom \"like dissolves like.\"\n\nTwo liquids that do not mix to an appreciable extent are called immiscible. Separate layers are formed when immiscible liquids are poured into the same container. Gasoline, oil (Figure 11.14), benzene, carbon tetrachloride, some paints, and many other nonpolar liquids are immiscible with water. Relatively weak attractive forces between the polar water molecules and the nonpolar liquid molecules are not adequate to overcome much stronger hydrogen bonding between water molecules.

Alcohols can be prepared from, and converted into, many other kinds of compounds.\n\nWe've already seen several methods of alcohol synthesis:\n\n- Alcohols can be prepared by hydration of alkenes. Because the direct hydration of alkenes with aqueous acid is generally a poor reaction in the laboratory, two indirect methods are commonly used. Hydroboration-oxidation yields the syn, non-Markovnikov hydration product (Section 8.5), whereas oxymercuration-demercuration yields the Markovnikov hydration product (Section 8.4).\n\n- 1,2-Diols can be prepared either by direct hydroxylation of an alkene with $\\mathrm{OsO}_{4}$ followed by reduction with $\\mathrm{NaHSO}_{3}$ or by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an epoxide (Section 8.7).

The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

In 1858, the German chemist August Kekulé and the Scottish chemist Archibald Couper independently proposed that, in all organic compounds, carbon is tetravalent-it always forms four bonds when it joins other elements to form stable compounds. Furthermore, said Kekulé, carbon atoms can bond to one another to form extended chains of linked atoms. In 1865, Kekulé provided another major advance when he suggested that carbon chains can double back on themselves to form rings of atoms.\n\nAlthough Kekule and Couper were correct in describing the tetravalent nature of carbon, chemistry was still viewed in a two-dimensional way until 1874. In that year, the Dutch chemist Jacobus van't Hoff and French chemist Joseph Le Bel added a third dimension to our ideas about organic compounds when they proposed that the four bonds of carbon are not oriented randomly but have specific spatial directions. Van't Hoff went even further and suggested that the four atoms to which carbon is bonded sit at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, with carbon in the center.\n\nA representation of a tetrahedral carbon atom is shown in FIGURE 1.7.

Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. It determines how the shared electrons are distributed between the two atoms in a bond. The more strongly an atom attracts the electrons in its bonds, the larger its electronegativity. Electrons in a polar covalent bond are shifted toward the more electronegative atom; thus, the more electronegative atom is the one with the partial negative charge. The greater the difference in electronegativity, the more polarized the electron distribution and the larger the partial charges of the atoms.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows the electronegativity values of the elements as proposed by one of the most famous chemists of the twentieth century: Linus Pauling (Figure 4.7). In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table and decreases down a group. Thus, the nonmetals, which lie in the upper right, tend to have the highest electronegativities, with fluorine the most electronegative element of all (EN = 4.0). Metals tend to be less electronegative elements, and the group 1 metals have the lowest electronegativities. Note that noble gases are excluded from this figure because these atoms usually do not share electrons with others atoms since they have a full valence shell. (While noble gas compounds such as $\\mathrm{XeO}_{2}$ do exist, they can only be formed under extreme conditions, and thus they do not fit neatly into the general model of electronegativity.)\n\n\nFIGURE 4.6 The electronegativity values derived by Pauling follow predictable periodic trends, with the higher electronegativities toward the upper right of the periodic table.",

Compounds that do not contain ions, but instead consist of atoms bonded tightly together in molecules (uncharged groups of atoms that behave as a single unit), are called covalent compounds. Covalent compounds usually form from two nonmetals.",

Ionic Bonding\n4.2 Covalent Bonding\n4.3 Chemical Nomenclature\n4.4 Lewis Symbols and Structures\n4.5 Formal Charges and Resonance\n4.6 Molecular Structure and Polarity\n\nINTRODUCTION It has long been known that pure carbon occurs in different forms (allotropes) including graphite and diamonds. But it was not until 1985 that a new form of carbon was recognized:\nbuckminsterfullerene. This molecule was named after the architect and inventor R. Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983), whose signature architectural design was the geodesic dome, characterized by a lattice shell structure supporting a spherical surface. Experimental evidence revealed the formula, $\\mathrm{C}_{60}$, and then scientists determined how 60 carbon atoms could form one symmetric, stable molecule. They were guided by bonding theory-the topic of this chapter-which explains how individual atoms connect to form more complex structures.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

They suggested that although interionic attraction in an aqueous solution is very greatly reduced by solvation of the ions and the insulating action of the polar solvent, it is not completely nullified. The residual attractions prevent the ions from behaving as totally independent particles (Figure 11.28). In some cases, a positive and negative ion may actually touch, giving a solvated unit called an ion pair. Thus, the activity, or the effective concentration, of any particular kind of ion is less than that indicated by the actual concentration. Ions become more and more widely separated the more dilute the solution, and the residual interionic attractions become less and less. Thus, in extremely dilute solutions, the effective concentrations of the ions (their activities) are essentially equal to the actual concentrations. Note that the van't Hoff factors for the electrolytes in Table 11.3 are for 0.05 m solutions, at which concentration the value of $i$ for NaCl is 1.9 , as opposed to an ideal value of 2 .\n\n\nFIGURE 11.28 Dissociation of ionic compounds in water is not always complete due to the formation of ion pairs.",

The Formation of Solutions - \nFIGURE 11.4 This schematic representation of dissolution shows a stepwise process involving the endothermic separation of solute and solvent species (Steps 1 and 2) and exothermic solvation (Step 3).\n\nConsider the example of an ionic compound dissolving in water. Formation of the solution requires the electrostatic forces between the cations and anions of the compound (solute-solute) be overcome completely as attractive forces are established between these ions and water molecules (solute-solvent). Hydrogen bonding between a relatively small fraction of the water molecules must also be overcome to accommodate any dissolved solute. If the solute's electrostatic forces are significantly greater than the solvation forces, the dissolution process is significantly endothermic and the compound may not dissolve to an appreciable extent. Calcium carbonate, the major component of coral reefs, is one example of such an \"insoluble\" ionic compound (see Figure 11.1). On the other hand, if the solvation forces are much stronger than the compound's electrostatic forces, the dissolution is significantly exothermic and the compound may be highly soluble. A common example of this type of ionic compound is sodium chloride, commonly known as table salt.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this module, spontaneous solution formation is favored, but not guaranteed, by exothermic dissolution processes. While many soluble compounds do, indeed, dissolve with the release of heat, some dissolve endothermically. Ammonium nitrate $\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3}\\right)$ is one such example and is used to make instant cold packs, like the one pictured in Figure 11.5, which are used for treating injuries. A thin-walled plastic bag of water is sealed inside a larger bag with solid $\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3}$. When the smaller bag is broken, a solution of $\\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ forms, absorbing heat from the surroundings (the injured area to which the pack is applied) and providing a cold compress that decreases swelling. Endothermic dissolutions such as this one require a greater energy input to separate the solute species than is recovered when the solutes are solvated, but they are spontaneous nonetheless due to the increase in disorder that accompanies formation of the solution.",

An acidic oxide, sulfur dioxide combines with water vapor in the air to produce sulfurous acid in the following reaction:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{SO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}(a q)\n$$\n\nCalcium carbonate reacts with sulfurous acid as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}(s)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}(a q) \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CaSO}_{3}(a q)+\\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(l)\n$$\n\nIn a polluted atmosphere where the concentration of sulfur dioxide is high, calcium carbonate deteriorates more rapidly than in less polluted air. Similarly, phosphorus burns much more rapidly in an atmosphere of pure oxygen than in air, which is only about $20 \\%$ oxygen.\n\n\nFIGURE 17.7 Statues made from carbonate compounds such as limestone and marble typically weather slowly over time due to the actions of water, and thermal expansion and contraction. However, pollutants like sulfur dioxide can accelerate weathering. As the concentration of air pollutants increases, deterioration of limestone occurs more rapidly. (credit: James P Fisher III)",

Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as double displacement, double replacement, or metathesis reactions. These reactions are common in nature and are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and gravimetric methods for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter).\n\nThe extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is quantitatively expressed as its solubility, defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively large solubilities are said to be soluble. A substance will precipitate when solution conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with relatively low solubilities are said to be insoluble, and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is provided in a later chapter on solutions. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that\nhave been observed for many ionic compounds (Table 7.1).",

The hypohalous acids are all very weak acids; however, HOCl is a stronger acid than HOBr , which, in turn, is stronger than HOI.\n\nThe addition of base to solutions of the hypohalous acids produces solutions of salts containing the basic\nhypohalite ions, $\\mathrm{OX}^{-}$. It is possible to isolate these salts as solids. All of the hypohalites are unstable with respect to disproportionation in solution, but the reaction is slow for hypochlorite.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

The products, called Grignard reagents (RMgX) after their discoverer, Francois Auguste Victor Grignard, who received the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are examples of organometallic compounds because they contain a carbon-metal bond. In addition to alkyl halides, Grignard reagents can also be made from alkenyl (vinylic) and aryl (aromatic) halides. The halogen can be Cl, Br, or I, although chlorides are less reactive than bromides and iodides. Organofluorides rarely react with magnesium.\n\n\nAs you might expect from the discussion of electronegativity and bond polarity in Section 6.3, the carbon-magnesium bond is polarized, making the carbon atom of Grignard reagents both nucleophilic and basic. An electrostatic potential map of methylmagnesium iodide, for instance, indicates the electron-rich (red) character of the carbon bonded to magnesium.\n\n\nA Grignard reagent is formally the magnesium salt, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}^{-+} \\mathrm{MgX}$, of a carbon acid, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$, and is thus a carbon anion, or carbanion.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with $\\sum$ representing \"the sum of\" and $n$ standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:\n\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\text {reaction }}^{\\circ}=\\sum n \\times \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}(\\text { products })-\\sum n \\times \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\circ}(\\text { reactants })\n$$\n\nThe following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest.\n\nEXAMPLE 9.15",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

Water has stronger hydrogen bonds, so it melts at a higher temperature.\n9. The hydrogen bond between two hydrogen fluoride molecules is stronger than that between two water molecules because the electronegativity of $F$ is greater than that of $O$. Consequently, the partial negative charge on F is greater than that on O . The hydrogen bond between the partially positive H and the larger partially negative F will be stronger than that formed between H and O .\n10. H -bonding is the principle IMF holding the protein strands together. The H -bonding is between the $\\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{H}$ and $\\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}$.\n11. (a) hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole attraction, and dispersion forces; (b) dispersion forces; (c) dipoledipole attraction and dispersion forces\n12. The water molecules have strong intermolecular forces of hydrogen bonding. The water molecules are thus attracted strongly to one another and exhibit a relatively large surface tension, forming a type of \"skin\" at its surface. This skin can support a bug or paper clip if gently placed on the water.",

Vaporization and Condensation - \nThe chemical identities of the molecules in a liquid determine the types (and strengths) of intermolecular attractions possible; consequently, different substances will exhibit different equilibrium vapor pressures. Relatively strong intermolecular attractive forces will serve to impede vaporization as well as favoring \"recapture\" of gas-phase molecules when they collide with the liquid surface, resulting in a relatively low vapor pressure. Weak intermolecular attractions present less of a barrier to vaporization, and a reduced likelihood of gas recapture, yielding relatively high vapor pressures. The following example illustrates this dependence of vapor pressure on intermolecular attractive forces.",

Two partially miscible liquids usually form two layers when mixed. In the case of the bromine and water mixture, the upper layer is water, saturated with bromine, and the lower layer is bromine saturated with water. Since bromine is nonpolar, and, thus, not very soluble in water, the water layer is only slightly discolored by the bright orange bromine dissolved in it. Since the solubility of water in bromine is very low, there is no noticeable effect on the dark color of the bromine layer (Figure 11.15).\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Bromine (the deep orange liquid on the left) and water (the clear liquid in the middle) are partially miscible.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

As the size of molecule increases from methanol to butanol, dispersion forces increase, which means that the vapor pressures decrease as observed:\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {methanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ethanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {propanol }}>\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {butanol }}$.\n\nAs temperature increases, the vapor pressure of a liquid also increases due to the increased average KE of its molecules. Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid. At the higher temperature, more molecules have the necessary kinetic energy, $K E$, to escape from the liquid into the gas phase.",

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform.

This does not violate any of Dalton's postulates: Atoms are neither created nor destroyed, but are redistributed in small, whole-number ratios.\n\nDalton knew of the experiments of French chemist Joseph Proust, who demonstrated that all samples of a pure compound contain the same elements in the same proportion by mass. This statement is known as the law of definite proportions or the law of constant composition. The suggestion that the numbers of atoms of the elements in a given compound always exist in the same ratio is consistent with these observations. For example, when different samples of isooctane (a component of gasoline and one of the standards used in the octane rating system) are analyzed, they are found to have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1, as shown in Table 2.1.\n\nConstant Composition of Isooctane\n\n| Sample | Carbon | Hydrogen |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | Mass Ratio.\n\nTABLE 2.1\n\nIt is worth noting that although all samples of a particular compound have the same mass ratio, the converse is not true in general. That is, samples that have the same mass ratio are not necessarily the same substance. For example, there are many compounds other than isooctane that also have a carbon-to-hydrogen mass ratio of 5.33:1.00.\n\nDalton also used data from Proust, as well as results from his own experiments, to formulate another interesting law. The law of multiple proportions states that when two elements react to form more than one compound, a fixed mass of one element will react with masses of the other element in a ratio of small, whole\nnumbers. For example, copper and chlorine can form a green, crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 0.558 g chlorine to 1 g copper, as well as a brown crystalline solid with a mass ratio of 1.116 g chlorine to 1 g copper. These ratios by themselves may not seem particularly interesting or informative; however, if we take a ratio of these ratios, we obtain a useful and possibly surprising result: a small, whole-number ratio.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature. The concentration of a gaseous solute in a solution is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas to which the solution is exposed, a relation known as Henry's law.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Answer: - \nAll these compounds exhibit hydrogen bonding; these strong IMFs are difficult for the molecules to overcome, so the vapor pressures are relatively low.

Recall that at any given temperature, the molecules of a substance experience a range of kinetic\nenergies, with a certain fraction of molecules having a sufficient energy to overcome IMF and escape the liquid (vaporize). At a higher temperature, a greater fraction of molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid, as shown in Figure 10.23. The escape of more molecules per unit of time and the greater average speed of the molecules that escape both contribute to the higher vapor pressure.\n\n\nFIGURE 10.23 Temperature affects the distribution of kinetic energies for the molecules in a liquid.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

Do solvents have the same effect in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions that they have in $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water. The electron-rich oxygen atoms of solvent molecules orient around the positively charged carbocation and thereby stabilize it.\n\nThe properties of a solvent that contribute to its ability to stabilize ions by solvation are related to the solvent's polarity. $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions take place much more rapidly in strongly polar solvents, such as water and methanol, than in less polar solvents, such as ether and chloroform. In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar). The rate increases when going from a hydrocarbon solvent to water are so large they can't be measured accurately.",

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

As the electric field around a given atom changes because of changing interactions with solvent or other polar molecules nearby, the electron distribution around that atom also changes. The measure of this response to an external electrical influence is called the polarizability of the atom. Larger atoms with more loosely held electrons are more polarizable, and smaller atoms with fewer, tightly held electrons are less polarizable. Thus, sulfur is more polarizable than oxygen, and iodine is more polarizable than chlorine. The effect of this higher polarizability of sulfur and iodine is that carbon-sulfur and carbon-iodine bonds, although nonpolar according to electronegativity values (FIGURE 2.3), nevertheless usually react as if they were polar.\n\n\nWhat does functional-group polarity mean with respect to chemical reactivity? Because unlike charges attract, the fundamental characteristic of all polar organic reactions is that electron-rich sites react with electron-poor sites. Bonds are made when an electron-rich atom donates a pair of electrons to an electron-poor atom, and bonds are broken when one atom leaves with both electrons from the former bond.\n\nAs we saw in Section 2.11, the movement of an electron pair during a polar reaction is indicated using a curved, full-headed arrow to show where electrons move when reactant bonds are broken and product bonds are formed during the reaction.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass.

Could we \"app\" chemistry?\n\nIn a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical \"inks\" with a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion a \"universal toolkit of chemistry.\" This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new superbug or to \"print\" medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health situation.

The products, called Grignard reagents (RMgX) after their discoverer, Francois Auguste Victor Grignard, who received the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, are examples of organometallic compounds because they contain a carbon-metal bond. In addition to alkyl halides, Grignard reagents can also be made from alkenyl (vinylic) and aryl (aromatic) halides. The halogen can be Cl, Br, or I, although chlorides are less reactive than bromides and iodides. Organofluorides rarely react with magnesium.\n\n\nAs you might expect from the discussion of electronegativity and bond polarity in Section 6.3, the carbon-magnesium bond is polarized, making the carbon atom of Grignard reagents both nucleophilic and basic. An electrostatic potential map of methylmagnesium iodide, for instance, indicates the electron-rich (red) character of the carbon bonded to magnesium.\n\n\nA Grignard reagent is formally the magnesium salt, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}^{-+} \\mathrm{MgX}$, of a carbon acid, $\\mathrm{R}_{3} \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$, and is thus a carbon anion, or carbanion. But because hydrocarbons are such weak acids, with $\\mathbf{p} \\mathbf{K}_{\\mathbf{a}}$ 's in the range 44 to 60 (Section 9.7), carbon anions are very strong bases. Grignard reagents must therefore be protected from atmospheric moisture to prevent their being protonated and destroyed in acid-base reactions: $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Mg}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{H}+$ HO-Mg-X.",

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Hydrocarbons\n21.2 Alcohols and Ethers\n21.3 Aldehydes, Ketones, Carboxylic Acids, and Esters\n21.4 Amines and Amides\n\nINTRODUCTION All living things on earth are formed mostly of carbon compounds. The prevalence of carbon compounds in living things has led to the epithet \"carbon-based\" life. The truth is we know of no other kind of life. Early chemists regarded substances isolated from organisms (plants and animals) as a different type of matter that could not be synthesized artificially, and these substances were thus known as organic compounds. The widespread belief called vitalism held that organic compounds were formed by a vital force present only in living organisms. The German chemist Friedrich Wohler was one of the early chemists to refute this aspect of vitalism, when, in 1828, he reported the synthesis of urea, a component of many body fluids, from nonliving materials. Since then, it has been recognized that organic molecules obey the same natural laws as inorganic substances, and the category of organic compounds has evolved to include both natural and synthetic compounds that contain carbon. Some carbon-containing compounds are not classified as organic, for example, carbonates and cyanides, and simple oxides, such as CO and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although a single, precise definition has yet to be identified by the chemistry community, most agree that a defining trait of organic molecules is the presence of carbon as the principal element, bonded to hydrogen and other carbon atoms.\n\nToday, organic compounds are key components of plastics, soaps, perfumes, sweeteners, fabrics, pharmaceuticals, and many other substances that we use every day. The value to us of organic compounds ensures that organic chemistry is an important discipline within the general field of chemistry. In this chapter, we discuss why the element carbon gives rise to a vast number and variety of compounds, how those compounds are classified, and the role of organic compounds in representative biological and industrial settings.",

Yes, solvents have a large effect on $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reactions, but no, the reasons for the effects on $S_{N} 1$ and $S_{N} 2$ reactions are not the same. Solvent effects in the $S_{N} 2$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the nucleophile reactant, while solvent effects in the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction are due largely to stabilization or destabilization of the transition state.\n\nThe Hammond postulate says that any factor stabilizing the intermediate carbocation should increase the rate of an $S_{N} 1$ reaction. Solvation of the carbocation-the interaction of the ion with solvent molecules-has such an\neffect. Solvent molecules orient around the carbocation so that the electron-rich ends of the solvent dipoles face the positive charge (FIGURE 11.15), thereby lowering the energy of the ion and favoring its formation.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.15 Solvation of a carbocation by water.

In the reaction of 2-chloro-2-methylpropane, for example, a rate increase of 100,000 is observed upon going from ethanol (less polar) to water (more polar).

The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

The magnitudes of these properties depend only on the total concentration of solute particles in solution, not on the type of particles. The total concentration of solute particles in a solution also determines its osmotic pressure. This is the pressure that must be applied to the solution to prevent diffusion of molecules of pure solvent through a semipermeable membrane into the solution.

Solubility\nThe extent to which one substance will dissolve in another is determined by several factors, including the types and relative strengths of intermolecular attractive forces that may exist between the substances' atoms, ions, or molecules. This tendency to dissolve is quantified as a substance's solubility, its maximum concentration in a solution at equilibrium under specified conditions. A\nsaturated solution contains solute at a concentration equal to its solubility. A supersaturated solution is one in which a solute's concentration exceeds its solubility-a nonequilibrium (unstable) condition that will result in solute precipitation when the solution is appropriately perturbed. Miscible liquids are soluble in all proportions, and immiscible liquids exhibit very low mutual solubility. Solubilities for gaseous solutes decrease with increasing temperature, while those for most, but not all, solid solutes increase with temperature.
