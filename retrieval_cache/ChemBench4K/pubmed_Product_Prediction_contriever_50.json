Their geometries (C(3v)) with all real harmonic vibrational frequencies were obtained at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level. For each H(3)C...LiY complex, single-electron Li bond is formed between the unpaired electron of CH(3) radical and positively charged Li atom of LiY molecule. Due to the formation of the single-electron Li bond, the C-H bonds of the CH(3) radical bend opposite to the LiY molecule and the Li-Y bond elongates. Abnormally, the three H(3)C...LiY (Y=CN, NC, and CCH) complexes exhibit blueshifted Li-Y stretching frequencies along with the elongated Li-Y bonds. Natural bond orbital analyses suggest ca. 0.02 electron transfer from the methyl radical (CH(3)) to the LiY moiety. In the single occupied molecular orbitals of the H(3)C...LiY complexes, it is also seen that the electron could of the CH(3) radical approaches the Li atom.

The mechanism of the formation of Ag[(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3] is explained based on the available experimental data as well as on quantum chemical calculations with the inclusion of entropy and COSMO solvation enthalpies. The crystal structures of (RO)3Al&lt;--OC4H8, Cs+[(RO)2(Me)Al-F-Al(Me)(OR)2]-, Ag(CH2Cl2)3+[(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3]- and Ag(eta2-P4)2+[(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3]- are described. From the collected data it will be shown that the [(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3]- anion is the least coordinating anion currently known. With respect to the fluoride ion affinity of two parent Lewis acids Al(OR)3 of 685 kJ mol(-1), the ligand affinity (441 kJ mol(-1)), the proton and copper decomposition reactions (-983 and -297 kJ mol(-1)) as well as HOMO level and HOMO-LUMO gap and in comparison with [Sb4F21]-, [Sb(OTeF5)6]-, [Al(OR)4]- as well as [B(R(F))4]- (R(F)=CF3 or C6F5) the [(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3]- anion is among the best weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) according to each value. In contrast to most of the other cited anions, the [(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3] anion is available by a simple preparation in conventional inorganic laboratories. The least coordinating character of this anion was employed to clarify the question of the ground state geometry of the Ag(eta2-P4)2+ cation (D(2h), D(2) or D(2d)?). In agreement with computational data and NMR spectra it could be shown that the rotation along the Ag-(P-P-centroid) vector has no barrier and that the structure adopted in the solid state depends on packing effects which lead to an almost D(2h) symmetric Ag(eta2-P4)2+ cation (0 to 10.6 degrees torsion) for the more symmetrical [Al(OR)4]- anion, but to a D2 symmetric Ag(eta2-P4)2+ cation with a 44 degrees twist angle of the two AgP2 planes for the less symmetrical [(RO)3Al-F-Al(OR)3]- anion.

The reaction of the Cp derivative 1a with AgX (X=CF3SO3, Al{OC(CF3)3}4) yields the one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (2) and [Ag{CpMo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta1:eta1-P3)}3]n[X]n (X=CF3SO3 (3a), Al{OC(CF3)3}4 (3b)). The solid-state structures of these polymers were revealed by X-ray crystallography and shown to comprise polycationic chains well-separated from the weakly coordinating anions. If AgCF3SO3 is used, polymer 3a is obtained regardless of reactant stoichiometry whereas in the case of Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4], reactant stoichiometry plays a decisive role in determining the structure and composition of the resulting product. Moreover, polymers 3a, b are the first examples of homoleptic silver complexes in which Ag(I) centers are found octahedrally coordinated to six phosphorus atoms. The Cp* derivative 1b reacts with Ag[Al{OC(CF3)3}4] to yield the 1D polymer [Ag{Cp*Mo(CO)2(mu,eta3:eta2:eta1-P3)}2]n[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]n (4), the crystal structure of which differs from that of polymer 2 in the coordination mode of the cyclo-P3 ligands: in 2, the Ag+ cations are bridged by the cyclo-P3 ligands in a eta1:eta1 (edge bridging) fashion whereas in 4, they are bridged exclusively in a eta2:eta1 mode (face bridging). Thus, one third of the phosphorus atoms in 2 are not coordinated to silver while in 4, all phosphorus atoms are engaged in coordination with silver. Comprehensive spectroscopic and analytical measurements revealed that the polymers 2, 3a, b, and 4 depolymerize extensively upon dissolution and display dynamic behavior in solution, as evidenced in particular by variable temperature 31P NMR spectroscopy. Solid-state 31P magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR measurements, performed on the polymers 2, 3b, and 4, demonstrated that the polymers 2 and 3b also display dynamic behavior in the solid state at room temperature.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

Collision induced dissociations of these anions, together with calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory indicate that the anions do not rearrange under conditions used to charge strip them to their neutrals. A comparison of the charge reversal (-CR+) and neutralization/reionization (-NR+) mass spectra of [CCCN]- indicate that neutral C3N species (formed by charge stripping of the anion) decompose by loss of C. Experimental studies with the 13C labeled analogues indicate that the loss of C occurs subsequent to or accompanying partial carbon scrambling of the CCCN backbone. Theoretical studies suggest that this scrambling may occur during equilibration of CCCN and CCNC via a decomposing \"rhombic\" C3N intermediate.",

Revealing an unusually fast Ni-catalyzed Negishi-type oxidative coupling reaction.\nFor a direct quantitative investigation of the Csp(2)-Csp(2) reductive elimination rate within a catalytic cycle, a novel oxidative coupling system in the presence of a Ni catalyst and desyl chloride as the oxidant is devised. The reaction progress profiles of arylzinc reagents exhibit zero-order kinetic behavior, and a reductive elimination step is confirmed as the rate-determining step. This allows direct measurement of the Csp(2)-Csp(2) reductive elimination rate constant within a catalytic cycle. The rate constants of p-MePhZnCl are obtained in the range 0.23 to 3.5 s(-1) from 0 to -35 degrees C, which are unusually fast reaction rates. According to the Arrhenius equation, the values of DeltaH(double dagger) and DeltaS(double dagger) (DeltaH(double dagger) = 9.7 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS(double dagger) = 35 J mol(-1) K(-1)) are obtained.

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

It is found that the decomposition of initiators with electron-donating R groups follows two favorable stepwise pathways: a two-bond cleavage mechanism in which the O-O single bond and one of R-C bonds of [R-C(O)O-O(O)C-R] break simultaneously followed by decomposition of the R-C(O)O(*) radical and a one-bond cleavage mechanism in which the single O-O bond cleavage produces a carboxyl radical pair and a subsequent decomposition of the carboxyl radicals. It is also found that the initiators with electron-withdrawing R groups follow the two-bond cleavage pathway only.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques.

Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution.

Turn off NCC.\nRenal K(+) excretion is increased rapidly following dietary K(+) intake, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Sorensen and colleagues show that K(+) intake in mice provoked rapid and near-complete dephosphorylation of the renal distal convoluted tubule NaCl cotransporter, temporally associated with increases in both Na(+) and K(+) excretion. This response was independent of aldosterone and may be a crucial component of the acute homeostatic adaptation of the kidney to K(+) intake.",

Gas phase IR spectroscopy, used to probe the coordination mode of the cyanoacetate ligands, revealed that the initial precursor ions are bound to the Cu via the carboxylate, [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN], 1. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) of 1 gave sequential losses of CO2 and ethene. DFT calculations suggest that the lowest energy pathways for sequential decarboxylation involve Lewis acid mechanisms in which the binding of the cyanoacetate ligand sequentially rearranges from O to N: [NCCH2CO2CuO2CCH2CN](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2CO2](-) → [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) + CO2 and [NCCH2CO2CuNCCH2](-) → [O2CCH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) + CO2. Loss of ethene involves sequential rearrangement of the binding of the cyanomethyl carbanion ligands from N to C: [CH2CNCuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuNCCH2](-) → [NCCH2CuCH2CN](-). CH2=CH2 loss then proceeds via a 1,2-dyotropic rearrangement to form [NCCuCH2CH2CN](-) followed by β-cyanide transfer. This study highlights the rich mechanistic possibilities for metal mediated decarboxylation reactions involving ambidentate carboxylate ligands.",

In 1 and 2 the ligand has undergone complete methanolysis and full deprotonation, yielding its dianionic bis-gem-diol form. In 3 it has undergone only partial methanolysis.

Ferromagnetism in 1 is caused by the structural constraints imposed by the {pyC(OMe)(O)pyC(OMe)(O)py}(2-) ligand on the Cu(II) ions, while in the case of 2 and 3 it is the result of the combined effect of the end-on azido and alkoxo bridges of dpcp, which form M-N(azido)-M and M-O(alkoxo)-M angles between 90-105 degrees.

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms. The k pathway involves attack by CN(-) at the copper site followed by dissociation of the thiolate. The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

We have probed the interconversion of CH(3)CN(+*) and its lower energy isomer CH(2)CNH(+*) by calculation, collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry and ion-molecule reaction. The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS.

The possible forms and structures of Zn species in the ionic liquids were analyzed according to the coordination number.

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms.

Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The complete reaction consists of an associative binding of one H(2)O from the second coordination sphere leading to a six-coordinate intermediate [Zn(H(2)O)(5)(L)](2+)·H(2)O, followed by the dissociation of a water molecule to reach the product state [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O. For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place. For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed. The gas-phase proton affinity of L shows instructive correlations with structural parameters and energy gaps for the investigated reactions.",

Energetically, the most favorable reaction route involves the barrierless addition of the oxygen atom to one of the carbon atoms of NCCO and the subsequent isomerization-decomposition via the four-center intermediate and transition state, leading to the final products NCO and CO2. At 298 K, the calculated overall rate constant is strongly pressure-dependent, which is in good agreement with the available experimental values. It is predicted that the high-pressure limit rate constants exhibit negative temperature dependence below 350 K.

The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

A development of the [Cl-]c-dependency and a reduction in [Cl-]c act as a second messenger of the beta 2 agonist signal transduction pathway in this Na+ transporting epithelium.",

The average coordination number and distance of Zn species at different x(ZnCl(2)) (mole fraction of ZnCl(2) when synthesizing) were calculated. It is shown that x(ZnCl(2)) has a regular influence on the coordination number of Zn species, due to the change of anion forms and structures in the ChCl-ZnCl(2) ionic liquid. The possible forms and structures of Zn species in the ionic liquids were analyzed according to the coordination number. XAFS and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) analysis imply that besides ZnCl(3)(-) and Zn(2)Cl(5)(-) anions, the Cl-Zn-Cl ion pair is a main species in the ionic liquid at higher x(ZnCl(2)). This newly discovered Zn species has substantial influence on the properties of the ionic liquid. From the analysis of the coordination numbers and coordination distance, a new mechanism of interactions between Ch(+) cation and Cl-Zn-Cl ion pairs or Cl(-) is proposed.",

Despite the fundamental role of this step, direct measurements of binding to transporters are rare. We investigated ion binding and selectivity in CLC-ec1, a H(+)-Cl(-) exchanger of the CLC family of channels and transporters. Cl(-) affinity depends on the conformation of the protein: it is highest with the extracellular gate removed and weakens as the transporter adopts the occluded configuration and with the intracellular gate removed. The central ion-binding site determines selectivity in CLC transporters and channels. A serine-to-proline substitution at this site confers NO(3)(-) selectivity upon the Cl(-)-specific CLC-ec1 transporter and CLC-0 channel. We propose that CLC-ec1 operates through an affinity-switch mechanism and that the bases of substrate specificity are conserved in the CLC channels and transporters.",

Addition of 1 to C=O and C=N functionalities gave easy access to calcium alkoxide and amide complexes. Similarly, reduction of the C[triple chemical bond]N bond in a cyanide or an isocyanide resulted in the first calcium aldimide complexes [Ca{N=C(H)R}(dipp-nacnac)] and [Ca{C(H)=NR}(dipp-nacnac)], respectively.

Complex 5.3MeCN.H(2)O crystallizes in monoclinic space group C2/c with (at -155 degrees C) a = 33.838(8) Å, b = 13.826(3) Å, c = 29.944(7) Å, beta = 98.84(1) degrees, and Z = 8.

The complexes contain [Co(4)O(2)(OH)(2)](6+) (5) and [Co(4)O(3)(OH)](5+) (6) distorted-cubane cores, the sites of protonation being apparent by (i) the approach of ClO(4)(-) or [Ce(NO(3))(6)](3)(-) anions to within hydrogen-bonding distances (O.O approximately 2.7 Å) and (ii) the longer Co-OH(-) bond lengths compared with Co-O(2)(-) bond lengths. Peripheral ligation is provided by chelating bpy and syn,syn-bridging RCO(2)(-) groups. The Co(III) atoms are six-coordinate and approximately octahedral. Solution studies show that the diprotonated species is a strong diprotic acid analogous to H(2)SO(4); the first deprotonation goes to completion, but the monoprotonated species is a weak acid and is in equilibirium with the nonprotonated species. pH studies in aqueous solution yield a pK(a2) value of 3.15 for the second deprotonation. Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution. The combined results demonstrate that the [Co(4)O(4)](4+) core is capable of acting as a Brønsted base, undergoing either one or two protonation reactions.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless. The decomposition and isomerization of some intermediates were also modeled at the QCISD(T)/6-311+G(2df)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d) level for the better understanding of the O((1)D) with CF(3)CN chemistry. The decomposition products CF(3) and NCO arising from CF(3)OCN and CF(3)NCO are the dominant species. Further comparison with similar reactions is also summarized.",

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S). This (3)Π state and its bent components cross at medium RXC (RXN) distances the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of XCN(-) or XNC(-), and at shorter distances the X(2)Π state of the neutral XCN or XNC where the extra electron can detach.

The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

Three unimolecular reactions were observed. 1,2-ClF interchange converts CF(2)ClCHFC(2)H(5)(CF(2)ClCHFC(2)D(5)) into CF(3)CHClC(2)H(5)(CF(3)CHClC(2)D(5)), and subsequent 2,3-ClH (ClD) elimination gives CF(3)CH=CHCH(3) (CF(3)CH=CDCD(3)). 2,3-FH(FD) elimination gives cis- and trans-CF(2)ClCH=CHCH(3) (CF(2)ClCH=CDCD(3)), and 1,2-ClH elimination gives CF(2)=CFCH(2)CH(3) (CF(2)=CFCD(2)CD(3)).

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2. Our observation of a molecular weight 102 species indicates that the CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 radical dominantly decomposes to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO plus CH3(*C)O, rather than decomposing to CH3C(O)CHO plus CH3C(O)(*C)HOH, isomerizing, or reacting with O2. Thermochemical calculations and an empirical estimation method for calculating alkoxy radical reaction rates are consistent with our experimental observations.",

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

Addition of a second equivalent of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* to this solution results in the formation of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* as well as (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2). Spectroscopic data show that (o-H(2)N)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* loses CO to form [eta(2)-(o-H(2)N)C(6)H(4)S]Cr(CO)(2)Cp*. Attack on the N-H bond of the coordinated amine by (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* provides a reasonable mechanism consistent with the observation that both chelate formation and oxidative addition of the N-H bond are faster under argon than under CO atmosphere. The N-H bonds of uncoordinated aniline do not react with (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp*. Reaction of the 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* with 1,2-benzene dithiol [1,2-C(6)H(4)(SH)(2)] yields the initial product (o-HS)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp and 1 mol of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*. Addition of 1 equiv more of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp to this solution also results in the formation of 1 equiv of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*, as well as the dimeric product (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-S)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2). This reaction also occurs more rapidly under Ar than under CO, consistent with intramolecular coordination of the second thiol group prior to oxidative addition.

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

It is interesting to find that CO+NO on Cu(2)O(111) could react to form adsorbed NCO surface species. Coadsorption of CO and NO could give rise to the formation of a O-C...N-O complex well bound to the Cu(2)O(111) surface, in which both the C-O and N-O bonds are greatly activated and the C-N bond is formed. Consequently, the reaction of CO with NO to form adsorbed NCO and CNO species may occur, for which it is disclosed that NCO formation is more possible than CNO formation both thermodynamically and kinetically. In addition, our calculations of searching transition states reveal that it is facile for NCO formation both kinetically and thermodynamically when CO+NO reaction takes place at Cu(CUS) site, and is impossible when this reaction takes places at O(vac) site. Moreover, CO(2) species cannot form when CO+NO reaction occurs at O(vac) site.

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

The eight-membered rings 1b and 1c adopt long boat conformations with the phenyl groups (attached to S) in equatorial positions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the model ring system (HC)(2)N(4)(SH)(2) reveal that the observed C(2)(v)() geometry is the result of a second-order Jahn-Teller distortion of the planar (D(2)(h)()) structure. The chair conformer (C(2)(h)()) is only ca. 10 kJ mol(-)(1) higher in energy than the boat conformer. The hypothetical dianion (HC)(2)N(4)(SH)(2)(2)(-) is predicted to have a transannular S.S contact of about 2.5 Å. The sixteen-membered ring 3 has a cradle-like structure with S(4) symmetry.",

This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution. The trimetallic complex [Co(trpyn)O2COZn(OH2)4OCO2Co(trpyn)](ZnCl4)2.H2O crystallises on prolonged standing of [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4 in a neutral solution having [Zn2+]=1.0 M. The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",

Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

However, the dissociation energies of all the neutral oxocarbons, C(n)()O(n)(), are highly exothermic.",

The first is hydrogenation of a CO surface. The second is co-injection of CO molecules and H atoms. Both methods have been performed at 3 and 10 K. In the first method, the interaction of H atoms with solid CO at 10 K shows that CO is consumed to form H(2)CO and CH(3)OH. No trace of species such as HCO and CH(3)O is detected. No product was observed when the same experiment was performed at 3 K. In the second method, when H and CO are codeposited at 10 K, HCO and CH(3)O are observed. In fact, the yield of these intermediate species depends on the amount of the H radicals interacting with CO molecules. At 3 K, the presence of H(2) in the solid screens the hydrogenation reaction. This causes a termination for the reaction in the stage of the formation of HCO and H(2)CO. At 10 K, H(2) cannot condense, and the reaction between CO and H is total. In this case, species such as HCO, H(2)CO, CH(3)O, and CH(3)OH are observed.",

For biological ligands, H(2)O and NH(3), the most stable spin state is high spin (S = (3)/(2)). The difference in energy between high and low spin is dependent upon the ligand mix and coordination stereochemistry. High spin optimized geometries for these model compounds give structures close to octahedral symmetry. Low spin permits significant Jahn-Teller distortion. H(2)O ligands preferentially assume axial positions. Continuum solvent has a greater effect on low spin Co(2+), and it reduces the energy difference between the two spin states. For some ligand combinations optimized in the presence of solvent, there is no significant difference in energy between spin states.",

The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The rate constants for the decomposition of CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)F in nitrogen and carbon monoxide fit the Arrhenius equations k(N)2 = (3.1 +/- 0.1) x 10(15) exp[-(29.0 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1)/RT)] and k(CO) = (5.8 +/- 1.3) x 10(15) exp[-(29.4 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1)/RT)], and that for CF(3)OC(O)OOCF(3) fits the equation k = (9.0 +/- 0.9) x 10(13) exp[-(34.0 +/- 0.7 kcal mol(-1)/RT)] (all in units of inverted seconds). Rupture of the O-O bond was shown to be the rate-determining step for both peroxides, and bond energies of 29 +/- 1 and 34.0 +/- 0.7 kcal mol(-1) were obtained for CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)F and CF(3)OC(O)OOCF(3). The heat of formation of the CF(3)OCO(2)(*) radical, which is a common product formed in both decompositions, was calculated by ab initio methods as -229 +/- 4 kcal mol(-1). With this value, the heat of formation of the title species and of CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)OCF(3) could in turn be obtained as Delta(f) degrees (CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)F) = -286 +/- 6 kcal mol(-1), Delta(f) degrees (CF(3)OC(O)OOCF(3)) = -341 +/- 6 kcal mol(-1), and Delta(f) degrees (CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)OCF(3)) = -430 +/- 6 kcal mol(-1).",

Addition of a second equivalent of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* to this solution results in the formation of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* as well as (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2). Spectroscopic data show that (o-H(2)N)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* loses CO to form [eta(2)-(o-H(2)N)C(6)H(4)S]Cr(CO)(2)Cp*. Attack on the N-H bond of the coordinated amine by (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* provides a reasonable mechanism consistent with the observation that both chelate formation and oxidative addition of the N-H bond are faster under argon than under CO atmosphere. The N-H bonds of uncoordinated aniline do not react with (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp*. Reaction of the 2 mol of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* with 1,2-benzene dithiol [1,2-C(6)H(4)(SH)(2)] yields the initial product (o-HS)C(6)H(4)S-Cr(CO)(3)Cp and 1 mol of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*. Addition of 1 equiv more of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp to this solution also results in the formation of 1 equiv of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp*, as well as the dimeric product (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-S)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2). This reaction also occurs more rapidly under Ar than under CO, consistent with intramolecular coordination of the second thiol group prior to oxidative addition. The crystal structures of [[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2) and [[eta(2)-o-(mu-S)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2) are reported.",

The majority of these complexes undergo clean C-O bond-forming reductive elimination, and the mechanism of this process has been investigated. A variety of experiments, including Hammett plots, Eyring analysis, crossover studies, and investigations of the influence of solvent and additives, suggest that C-O bond-forming reductive elimination proceeds via initial carboxylate dissociation followed by C-O coupling from a 5-coordinate cationic Pd(IV) intermediate.

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

An ab initio study at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory indicates that (i) triplet NCCCCCN is the ground state with a T/S energy gap of -14.9 kcal mol(-1); (ii) the structures of triplet and singlet NCCCCCN need to be described by molecular obital theory, and a simple valence bond approach cannot be used for this system; and (iii) there are several possible routes by which an energized neutral may lose carbon, but the major route involves the triplet nitrile to isonitrile rearrangement NCCCCCN --&gt; CNCCCCN --&gt; NCCCCN + C.",

Synthesis and photoinduced electron transfer of perylenediimide donors covalently linked to C59N and C60 acceptors.\nThe first perylenediimide (PDI) covalently linked to an azafullerene (C59N) is described. PDI-C59N and PDI-C60 dyads where PDI acts as an electron-donor moiety have been synthesized by connection of the balls to the PDI 1-bay position. Photoexcitation of the PDI unit in both systems results in formation of the charge-separated state by photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the PDI moiety to the C59N or to the C60 moiety. The charge-separated state has a lifetime of 400 ps in the case of PDI-C59N and 120 ps for the PDI-C60 dyad in benzonitrile at 298 K. This result has significant implications for the design of organic solar cells based on covalent donor-acceptor systems using C59N as an electron acceptor, indicating that longer-lived charge-separated states can be attained using C59N systems instead of C60 systems.

The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination.

Product studies of the Cl atom initiated oxidation of ethylene glycol diacetate in the presence of NO in 700 Torr of O2/N2 diluent at 296 K show the primary products to be CH3C(O)OC(O)H and CH3C(O)OH. The CH3C(O)OCH2O* radical is formed during the Cl atom initiated oxidation of ethylene glycol diacetate, and two loss mechanisms were identified: reaction with O2 to give CH3C(O)OC(O)H and alpha-ester rearrangement to give CH3C(O)OH and HC(O) radicals. The reaction of CH3C(O)OCH2O2* with NO gives chemically activated CH3C(O)OCH2O* radicals which are more likely to undergo decomposition via the alpha-ester rearrangement than CH3C(O)OCH2O* radicals produced in the peroxy radical self-reaction.",

The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless. The decomposition and isomerization of some intermediates were also modeled at the QCISD(T)/6-311+G(2df)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d) level for the better understanding of the O((1)D) with CF(3)CN chemistry. The decomposition products CF(3) and NCO arising from CF(3)OCN and CF(3)NCO are the dominant species. Further comparison with similar reactions is also summarized.",

These complexes have hydrogen bonds with two equivalent N-H donors to F(-). As the basicity of the nitrogen donor decreases, the N-H distance increases and the N-H-F-H-N arrangement changes from linear to bent. As these changes occur and the hydrogen bonds between the ion pairs acquire increased proton-shared character, (2h)J(F)(-)(N) increases in absolute value and (1h)J(H)(-)(F) changes sign. F(H(3)NH)(2)(+) complexes were also optimized as a function of the N-H distance. As this distance increases and the N-H...F hydrogen bonds change from ion-pair to proton-shared to traditional F-H...N hydrogen bonds, (2h)J(F)(-)(N) initially increases and then decreases in absolute value, (1)J(N)(-)(H) decreases in absolute value, and (1h)J(H)(-)(F) changes sign. The signs and magnitudes of these coupling constants computed for F(H(3)NH)(2)(+) at short N-H distances are in agreement with the experimental signs and magnitudes determined for the F(collidineH)(2)(+) complex in solution. However, even when the N-H and F-H distances are taken from the optimized structure of F(collidineH)(2)(+), (2h)J(F)(-)(N) and (1h)J(H)(-)(F) are still too large relative to experiment. When the distances extracted from the experimental NMR data are used, there is excellent agreement between computed and experimental coupling constants. This suggests that the N-H-F hydrogen bonds in the isolated gas-phase F(collidineH)(2)(+) complex have too much proton-shared character relative to those that exist in solution.",

Addition of a second equivalent of (*)Cr(CO)(3)Cp* to this solution results in the formation of H-Cr(CO)(3)Cp* as well as (1)/(2)[[eta(2)-o-(mu-NH)C(6)H(4)S]CrCp*](2).

Peripheral ligation is provided by chelating bpy and syn,syn-bridging RCO(2)(-) groups. The Co(III) atoms are six-coordinate and approximately octahedral. Solution studies show that the diprotonated species is a strong diprotic acid analogous to H(2)SO(4); the first deprotonation goes to completion, but the monoprotonated species is a weak acid and is in equilibirium with the nonprotonated species. pH studies in aqueous solution yield a pK(a2) value of 3.15 for the second deprotonation. Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution.

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the survival between patients with OC-HNPCC and a control group. A total of 26 patients with OC were identified from the Dutch HNPCC Registry. A control group (52 cases) matched for age, stage and year of diagnosis was derived from the population-based Eindhoven Cancer Registry. Data on treatment were collected for all patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate the crude survival. The mean age at diagnosis of OC-HNPCC was significantly lower than the age of sporadic OC (49.5 vs 60.9 years). Compared to sporadic OC, OC-HNPCC was diagnosed at an earlier stage. The survival rate was not significantly different between patients with OC-HNPCC and the controls with sporadic OC.

However, the involvement of CAFs in oral cancer (OC) has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare OCCM versus CCC in TCA using end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2), the criterion standard for determining the effectiveness of chest compressions and detection of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), as the surrogate for cardiac output and marker for adequacy of resuscitation. This prospective observational study enrolled patients over a 9-month period directly presenting to a level 1 trauma center after TCA. Continuous high-resolution ETCO2 measurements were collected every 6 seconds for periods of CCC and OCCM, respectively. Patients receiving CCC only were compared with patients receiving CCC followed by OCCM. Student's t tests were used to compare ETCO2 within and between groups. Thirty-three patients were enrolled (16 OCCM, 17 CCC-only). Mean time of CCC before OCCM was 66 seconds. Within the OCCM group, final, peak, mean, and median ETCO2 levels significantly increased when comparing the initial CCC period to the OCCM interval. Using a time-matched comparison, significant increases were observed in the final and peak but not mean and median values when comparing the first minute of CCC to the remaining time in the CCC-only group. However, when periods of OCCM were compared with equivalent periods of CCC-only, there were no differences in the initial, final, peak, mean, or median ETCO2 values. Correspondingly, no difference in rates of ROSC was observed between groups (OCCM 23.5% vs. CCC 38.9%; p = 0.53).

CXCL-8 is produced by malignant cells, and therefore it can stimulate the growth and progression of various neoplasms, including oesophageal cancer (OC). The aim of the current study was to measure serum concentrations of chemokine CXCL-8 in OC patients and establish whether this protein might be considered a potential candidate for a tumor marker in the diagnosis and progression of OC. The study included 50 OC subjects (32 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oesophagus-OSCC, 18 patients with adenocarcinoma-OAC) and 26 healthy volunteers. Serum CXCL-8 concentrations were measured using immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA). CRP levels were determined by immunoturbidimetric method, while classical tumor marker levels were measured using chemiluminescent immunoassay. CXCL-8 concentrations were significantly higher in OC patients compared to healthy controls. We demonstrated significant differences between CXCL-8 concentrations and depth of tumor invasion (T factor) in OC patients and OSCC subgroup. In addition, CXCL-8 levels were found to correlate positively with T factor and CRP concentrations. The diagnostic sensitivity, negative predictive value and the area under ROC curve (AUC) of CXCL-8 were higher than those of classical tumor markers. Our findings suggest the potential usefulness of CXCL-8 in the diagnosis and progression of OC.

Pretreatment serum OC levels were determined with a radioimmunoassay kit in a total of 63 patients with prostate cancer (8 with stage B, 12 with stage C, 12 with stage D1, and 31 with metastatic bone disease). The OC levels in patients with skeletal metastasis were significantly higher than those in patients without bony lesions (P less than 0.01). The pattern of the initial changes in OC levels were analyzed in patients with skeletal metastasis who received endocrine treatment. The pretreatment OC value is of little use in predicting the response to treatment. The patients whose OC level initially increased and remained high tended to have a shorter interval to disease progression. On the other hand, the pattern of initial changes in OC varied according to the regimen of endocrine treatment. Our study suggests that OC seem to reflect the response to treatment and might lead to the improvement in follow-up procedures.

While the CO loci are enriched for OSK motifs, the OC loci are not, suggesting alternative mechanisms for chromatin closing.

Antioxidants can reduce the risk of OCCC formation by quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the oxidant stress-tolerant properties assist in the survival of OCCC cells when the malignant transformation has already occurred. Moreover, the acquisition of oxidative stress resistance is also involved in the cancer stemness of OCCC. This review summarizes the recent advances in the process and prevention of carcinogenesis, the characteristic nature of tumors, and the treatment of post-refractory OCCCs, which are highly linked to oxidative stress.

Patients were stratified into three groups: laparoscopic/robotic-assisted colectomy (MIC), converted colectomy (CC), and open colectomy (OC). Multivariable modeling was applied to compare outcomes from CC and MIC to OC while adjusting for patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics. Of 104,400 patients, 40,328 (38.6 %) underwent MIC, 57,928 (55.5 %) OC, and 6144 (5.9 %) CC. After adjustment, the rate of positive surgical margins was not significantly different between CC and OC (p = 0.44). However, with adjustment, CC versus OC was associated with shorter hospital length of stay (4 % decrease, 95 % CI 2-5 %, p &lt; 0.0001) and lower odds of 30-day mortality (OR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.64-0.94, p = 0.0112). Adjusted overall survival was similar between CC and OC (p = 0.34).

This study confirms the usefulness of midnight salivary cortisol measurements in the diagnosis of overt CS in the everyday endocrinological praxis.

The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination.

An ab initio study at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory indicates that (i) triplet NCCCCCN is the ground state with a T/S energy gap of -14.9 kcal mol(-1); (ii) the structures of triplet and singlet NCCCCCN need to be described by molecular obital theory, and a simple valence bond approach cannot be used for this system; and (iii) there are several possible routes by which an energized neutral may lose carbon, but the major route involves the triplet nitrile to isonitrile rearrangement NCCCCCN --&gt; CNCCCCN --&gt; NCCCCN + C.",

These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

A development of the [Cl-]c-dependency and a reduction in [Cl-]c act as a second messenger of the beta 2 agonist signal transduction pathway in this Na+ transporting epithelium.",

Though recent advances have improved our understanding of the biology underlying cHCC-CCAs, they remain diagnostically challenging for pathologists because of their morphologic and phenotypic diversity. Accurate diagnosis of cHCC-CCA is important for patient management and prognostication.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

However, the involvement of CAFs in oral cancer (OC) has not been well addressed. In this study, we demonstrate that CAFs, when cocultured with OC cells (OCCs), produce high levels of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and, subsequently, enhance endogenous reactive oxygen species production in cells. Oxidative stress stimulates expression of cell cycle progression proteins in OCCs, leading to promotion of OCC proliferation, migration, invasion and, OC tumor growth. On the other hand, oxidative stress triggered the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and STAT3 in CAFs, resulting in accelerating CCL2 expression. In this way, CAFs-OCCs coculture creates a favorable cytokine-rich microenvironment, beneficial for both CAFs and OCCs. In addition, upregulation of CCL2 expression has been observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma tumors and patient plasma. We also showed that inhibition of CCL2 reduced OC tumor burden in mice.

The disease is characterized by decreased chloride secretion and unregulated sodium absorption through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the airway epithelium and other affected organs. We hypothesize that a non-CFTR alternative chloride channel ClCN2 can be activated to negatively regulate ENaC in CF epithelial cell cultures. We identified a novel interaction between ClCN2 and the ENaCγ subunit in CF airway epithelial cells and show that the upregulation of ClCN2 leads to decreased expression of ENaCγ via a K63 ubiquitination mechanism. These regulatory effects of ClCN2 on ENaCγ appear to be dependent on the CBS-1 domain located within the c-terminus of ClCN2, which is necessary for the targeting of ClCN2 to the apical surface. In sum, these results suggest the ability of ClCN2 to negatively regulate sodium absorption through ENaC, supporting its role as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CF. ",

Claudin-1 was observed in the membrane of tumor cells in 51 cases (89.5%), CLDN-4 in 36 cases (63.2%), and CLDN-7 in 48 cases (80%). Claudin-5 was detected in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 46 cases (78%) and OCLN in 40 cases (70.2%). In a multivariate analysis, the combined evaluation of OCLN and CLDN-1 revealed a significant and independent association with cancer-specific survival and recurrence-free survival. We found a low extent score for OCLN and a high intensity score for CLDN-1, presenting the hazard ratios of 15.48 (P = .014) and 9.446 (P = .012), respectively. The CLDN-1 and OCLN proteins could be involved in tumor progression of OSCC.

Both single and steady-state turnover kinetics studies indicate that O(2) binding is rate-determining and that O-O bond cleavage and electron transfer from reduced Cytc to the oxidized model complex are relatively fast.",

A joint experimental and theoretical study (energies calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) suggests that the neutral radical CCC(O)Ph rearranges via a four-centred ipso radical cyclisation/ring opening to form the isomer PhCCCO in an exothermic reaction. (13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

An unusual diastereomeric CB[6] with a Möbius geometry (13) is proposed as a mechanistic intermediate in the conversion of iCB[6] to CB[6] under anhydrous acidic conditions. The improved mechanistic understanding provided by this study suggests improved routes to CB[n]-type compounds.",

In this study, it is attempted to learn about how the .CCl3 and CCl3O2. tend to react with hydroxyproline in a model system. Hydroxyproline was selected because of its role in collagen metabolism. During the interaction of both radicals with hydroxyproline a total of 16 reaction products were isolated and identified by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis. All of them were hydroxyproline analogs, no single one contained C from CCl4 and only three contained chlorine. Consequently, most adducts would be missed in experiments where formation of reaction products are studied by formation of(14)C or(36)Cl labeled adducts (e.g. covalent binding studies used by toxicologists). If similar hydroxyproline analog reaction products were observed during CCl4 intoxication it might be reasonably expected that they interfered with collagen metabolism and participate in cirrhogenic effects of CCl4 on the liver.

The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

A mechanistic point of view.\nThe mechanism of copper-mediated coupling reactions has aroused widespread interest, and it has been found to not be as simple as initially thought. In this article, we give an overview of the recent advances in this field. Notably, we focus on whether the presence of CuIII is adopted in the catalytic cycle. Attention is paid to the key CuII species, which can be generated by radical-type or single electron transfer (SET) oxidation of CuI. The CuII species can be oxidized to CuIII by SET or using a nucleophilic radical for further reductive elimination. Alternatively, radical-type substitution or bimetallic reductive elimination can avoid formation of CuIII, and coupling reactions can also be achieved.",

In this report, a combined experimental and computational study is presented, which provides mechanistic understanding of the unprecedented oxidative coupling of NHCs at Cu. The presence of Cu(I) -, Cu(II) -, and Cu(III) -NHC complexes during the process is postulated, with the unusual Ccarbene -Ccarbene oxidative coupling reaction occurring under extremely mild reaction conditions.

These complexes have hydrogen bonds with two equivalent N-H donors to F(-). As the basicity of the nitrogen donor decreases, the N-H distance increases and the N-H-F-H-N arrangement changes from linear to bent. As these changes occur and the hydrogen bonds between the ion pairs acquire increased proton-shared character, (2h)J(F)(-)(N) increases in absolute value and (1h)J(H)(-)(F) changes sign. F(H(3)NH)(2)(+) complexes were also optimized as a function of the N-H distance.

When the distances extracted from the experimental NMR data are used, there is excellent agreement between computed and experimental coupling constants.

A prominent feature of the proposed mechanisms is that the transition state during ATP synthesis is formed when a catalytic site is in the process of closing and that the transition state during ATP hydrolysis is formed when a catalytic site is in the process of opening. The unusual kinetics of formation of Mg-ADP-fluoroaluminate complexes in one or two catalytic sites of nucleotide-depleted MF(1) and wild-type and mutant alpha(3)beta(3)gamma subcomplexes of TF(1) are also reviewed.

Three unimolecular reactions were observed. 1,2-ClF interchange converts CF(2)ClCHFC(2)H(5)(CF(2)ClCHFC(2)D(5)) into CF(3)CHClC(2)H(5)(CF(3)CHClC(2)D(5)), and subsequent 2,3-ClH (ClD) elimination gives CF(3)CH=CHCH(3) (CF(3)CH=CDCD(3)). 2,3-FH(FD) elimination gives cis- and trans-CF(2)ClCH=CHCH(3) (CF(2)ClCH=CDCD(3)), and 1,2-ClH elimination gives CF(2)=CFCH(2)CH(3) (CF(2)=CFCD(2)CD(3)).

We can give the following conclusions: (1) when the concentration of NaDC is smaller than C.M.C, Co2+ ions react with mono-molecular NaDC and the component of the pink wadding-like resultant is Co(DC)2 x 3H2O. (2) When the concentration of NaDC is larger than C.M.C, and the concentration of CoCl2 is higher (0.5 mol/L), Co2+ ions destroy NaDC micelles, and the component of the pink wadding-like resultant is also Co(DC)2 x 3H2O. (3) When the concentration of NaDC is larger than C.M.C, and the concentration of CoCl2 is lower (0.1 mol/L or more lower), Co(DC)2 and NaDC may form mixed micelles, and some of NaDC micelles connect with each other through the Co2+ bridges to produce complicate Co(DC)2-NaDC complex with gel character and macromolecular network structure.

Research on prokaryotic CLC homologues provided long-anticipated high-resolution structures as well as the unexpected discovery that some CLCs are not chloride channels, but rather are proton-chloride antiporters. Hence, CLCs encompass two functional classes of transport proteins once thought to be fundamentally different from one another. In this review, we discuss the structural features and molecular mechanisms of CLC channels and antiporters. We focus on ClC-0, the most thoroughly studied CLC channel, and ClC-ec1, the prokaryotic antiporter of known structure. We highlight some striking similarities between these CLCs and discuss compelling questions that remain to be addressed. Prokaryotic CLCs will undoubtedly continue to shed light upon this understudied family of proteins.",

We have probed the interconversion of CH(3)CN(+*) and its lower energy isomer CH(2)CNH(+*) by calculation, collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry and ion-molecule reaction. The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS. CH(3)CN(+*) reacts by proton-transfer with CO(2) and charge transfer with COS, whereas CH(2)CNH(+*) is unreactive.",

Their geometries (C(3v)) with all real harmonic vibrational frequencies were obtained at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ level. For each H(3)C...LiY complex, single-electron Li bond is formed between the unpaired electron of CH(3) radical and positively charged Li atom of LiY molecule. Due to the formation of the single-electron Li bond, the C-H bonds of the CH(3) radical bend opposite to the LiY molecule and the Li-Y bond elongates. Abnormally, the three H(3)C...LiY (Y=CN, NC, and CCH) complexes exhibit blueshifted Li-Y stretching frequencies along with the elongated Li-Y bonds. Natural bond orbital analyses suggest ca. 0.02 electron transfer from the methyl radical (CH(3)) to the LiY moiety. In the single occupied molecular orbitals of the H(3)C...LiY complexes, it is also seen that the electron could of the CH(3) radical approaches the Li atom. The single-electron Li bond energies are 5.20-6.94 kcal/mol for the H(3)C...LiY complexes at the CCSD(T)aug-cc-pVDZ+BF (bond functions) level with counterpoise procedure.

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

The RCO(2)(-) groups bridge each basal edge to give C(4)(v)() virtual symmetry. The apical and basal metals are V(V) and V(IV), respectively (i.e., the anions are trapped-valence). The reaction of 1b with AgNO(3) and Na(tca) (tca = thiophene-2-carboxylate) in MeCN under anaerobic conditions gives (NEt(4))(2)[V(4)O(8)(NO(3))(tca)(4)] (7).

The anion of 7 is similar to those of 4a and 6b except that the apical [VO] unit is absent, leaving a V(4) square unit, and the &amp;mgr;(4)-X(-) ion is replaced with a &amp;mgr;(4),eta(1)-NO(3)(-) ion. The four metal centers are now at the V(IV), 3V(V) oxidation level, but the structure indicates four equivalent V centers, suggesting an electronically delocalized system. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility data were collected on powdered samples of 4b, 6a, and 7 in the 2.00-300 K range in a 10 kG applied field. 4b and 6a both show a slow increase in effective magnetic moment (&amp;mgr;(eff)) from approximately 3.6-3.7 &amp;mgr;(B) at 320 K to approximately 4.5-4.6 &amp;mgr;(B) at 11.0 K and then a slight decrease to approximately 4.2 &amp;mgr;(B) at 2.00 K. The data were fit to the theoretical expression for a V(IV)(4) square with two exchange parameters J = J(cis)() and J' = J(trans)() (H = -2JS(i)()S(j)()): fitting of the data gave, in the format 4b/6a, J= +39.7/+46.4 cm(-)(1), J' = -11.1/-18.2 cm(-)(1) and g = 1.83/1.90, with the complexes possessing S(T) = 2 ground states. The latter were confirmed by magnetization vs field studies in the 2.00-30.0 K and 0.500-50.0 kG ranges: fitting of the data gave S(T) = 2 and D = 0.00 cm(-)(1) for both complexes, where D is the axial zero-field splitting parameter. Complex 7 shows a nearly temperature-independent &amp;mgr;(eff) (1.6-2.0 &amp;mgr;(B)) consistent with a single d electron per V(4) unit. The (1)H NMR spectra of 4b and 6a in CD(3)CN are consistent with retention of their pentanuclear structure on dissolution.

Various possible isomerization and dissociation pathways are probed. The initial association between C((3)P) and trans-C(4)H(8) is found to be the C((3)P) addition to the C=C bond of trans-C(4)H(8) to barrierlessly generate the three-membered cyclic isomer 1 CH(3)-cCHCCH-CH(3). Subsequently, 1 undergoes a ring-opening process to form the chainlike isomer 3a cis-trans-CH(3)CHCCHCH(3), which can either lead to P(6)((2)CH(3)CHCCCH(3) + (2)H) via the C-H bond cleavage or to P(7)((2)CH(3)CHCCH + (2)CH(3)) via C-C bond rupture. These two paths are the most favorable channels of the title reaction. Other channels leading to products P(1)((2)CH(3)-cCHCCH + (2)CH(3)), P(2)((2)CH(3)-cCHCC-CH(3) + (2)H), P(3)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(4)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(5)((3)CH(3)CH + (1)CH(3)CCH), P(8)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(9)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(10)((2)CH(3)CCCH(2) + (2)CH(3)), and P(11)((2)CH(3)CHCCHCH(2) + (2)H), however, are much less competitive due to either kinetic or thermodynamic factors. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the C((3)P) + trans-C(4)H(8) reaction all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured large rate constant. Our results may be helpful for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

In this study, we have elucidated the structure of this novel adduct with the use of mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 13C NMR as a substitution product of a -C(Cl) = CCl2 moiety for a beta-hydrogen atom on the prosthetic heme's ring I vinyl group. From studies with the use of 13C-enriched BrCCl3, it was determined that the added carbon atoms were derived from 2 eq of BrCCl3. A mechanism that involves multiple reductive events and a radical cation heme intermediate is proposed. Consistent with this mechanism, cellular reductants were found to selectively enhance the amount of this novel dissociable heme adduct. These studies reveal fine differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin in the accessibility of reactive intermediates to the ring I vinyl group, as well as the potential importance of cellular reductants on the course of heme alteration.",

However, it is shown that copper(I) carbenes generally undergo rapid unimolecular rearrangements including insertions into copper-ligand bonds and Wolff rearrangements. The results indicate that most copper(I) carbenes are inherently unstable and would not be viable intermediates in condensed-phase applications; an alternative intermediate that is less prone to rearrangements is required. Computational data suggest that ylides formed by the complexation of the carbene with solvent or other weak nucleophiles are viable intermediates in the reactions of copper(I) carbenes. ",

For instance, a 3.4% Cu/TiO(2) catalyst exhibits a higher turnover rate for the effective removal of CO in air than 3-5% Pt/TiO(2) and 20% Cu/ZnO/Al(2)O(3) catalysts. A small amount of Cu(+) species is formed during the calcination treatment at 225 °C, which is the main active phase for the CO oxidation. However, it is proposed that some highly dispersed CuO can also form in the TiO(2) lattice during the calcination treatment. Furthermore, a strong electron interaction between Cu(2+) in highly dispersed CuO and Ti(3+) on rutile TiO(2) (Cu(2+)+Ti(3+)→Cu(+)+Ti(4+)) has been shown to occur. Overall, the reduction of Cu(+) is a major factor that contributes to the reaction rate of the CO oxidation.",

The rearrangement of CCCCCHO to HCCCCCO.\nThe neutrals HCCCCCO and CCCCCHO have been studied by experiment and by molecular modelling at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Neutral HCCCCCO has been made by one-electron reduction of [HCCCCCO]+ in the dual collision cell of a VG ZAB 2HF mass spectrometer. The isomer CCCCCHO is also formed in the dual collision cell, but this time by one-electron oxidation of the anion [CCCCCHO]-. Comparison of the CID and +NR+ mass spectra of [HCCCCCO]+ indicates that neutral HCCCCCO, when energised, retains its structural integrity. If the excess energy of HCCCCCO is &gt; or = 170 kJ mol-1, decomposition can occur to give HCCCC and CO (calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory). The situation with the isomer CCCCCHO is different. Comparison of the -CR+ and -NR+ spectra of [CCCCCHO]- shows that both neutral and cationic forms of CCCCCHO partially rearrange to a species which decomposes by loss of CO. The peak corresponding to loss of CO is more pronounced in the -NR+ spectrum, indicating that the rearrangement is more prevalent for the neutral than the cation. Theoretical calculations suggest that the species losing CO could be CCCCHCO or HCCCCCO, but that HCCCCCO is the more likely. The lowest-energy rearrangement pathway occurs by successive H transfers, namely CCCCCHO--&gt;CCCCHCO--&gt;CCCHCCO--&gt;HCCCCCO. The rearrangement of CCCCCHO to HCCCCCO requires CCCCCHO to have an excess energy of &gt; or = 94 kJ mol-1.

It is suggested that the C-S heterolysis in the radical cation is an unimolecular process leading to an ion radical pair. Fast 1,2-hydride shift in the secondary carbocation leads to 1-methylcyclopentyl carbocation that forms the observed products by reaction with H(2)O and MeCN. Attack of H(2)O on the ion radical pair may also occur, but as a minor route (&lt;3%), with formation of trans-2-methylcyclopentanol.",

The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O2COH)]ZnCl(4).3H2O is isolated as a crystalline solid from an acidic solution of the parent carbonate [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4, and X-ray structural analysis shows that lengthening of the C=Oexo bond and shortening of the C-Oendo bond accompanies protonation. The bimetallic complex [Co(Me-tpa)O2COZnCl3] results from the unexpected coordination of ZnCl3- to the exo O atom of a chelated carbonate ligand. This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution. The trimetallic complex [Co(trpyn)O2COZn(OH2)4OCO2Co(trpyn)](ZnCl4)2.H2O crystallises on prolonged standing of [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4 in a neutral solution having [Zn2+]=1.0 M. The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",
