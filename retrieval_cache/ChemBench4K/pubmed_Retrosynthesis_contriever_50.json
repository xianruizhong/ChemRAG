Moreover, agents that block the S1P signaling pathway inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth or induce apoptosis.

Antioxidants can reduce the risk of OCCC formation by quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the oxidant stress-tolerant properties assist in the survival of OCCC cells when the malignant transformation has already occurred. Moreover, the acquisition of oxidative stress resistance is also involved in the cancer stemness of OCCC. This review summarizes the recent advances in the process and prevention of carcinogenesis, the characteristic nature of tumors, and the treatment of post-refractory OCCCs, which are highly linked to oxidative stress.

These cells have been defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells. CSCs can be isolated both from tumor specimens and established cancer cell lines on the basis of their ability to exclude fluorescent dyes, express specific cell surface markers or grow in particular culture conditions. A key feature of CSCs is their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, which could contribute to the remaining of residual cancer cells after therapeutic treatments. It has been shown that CSC-like cells can be isolated after drug treatment of cancer cell lines; in this review, we will describe the strategies so far applied to identify and isolate CSCs.

Neutrals MeCCCO, CCC(O)Me and PhCCCO are stable for the microsecond duration of the neutralisation experiment. A joint experimental and theoretical study (energies calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) suggests that the neutral radical CCC(O)Ph rearranges via a four-centred ipso radical cyclisation/ring opening to form the isomer PhCCCO in an exothermic reaction. (13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

Herein, we demonstrate an efficient route to access related complexes with tetradentate CCCN and pentadentate CCCCN and NCCCN cores by successive modification of the coordinating atoms in complexes with a CCCC core. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the rich reactivity of metal-carbon bonds and the inherent aromaticity of the metallacyclic skeletons play key roles in these transformations. This strategy addresses the paucity of synthetic approaches to mixed N/C planar pentadentate chelating species and provides valuable insights into the synthesis of carbon-based high-coordinate complexes. Furthermore, the resulting complexes are the examples of organometallic species with combined photoacoustic, photothermal, and sonodynamic properties, which makes them promising for application in related areas.",

Unlike the comparable ring expansion of the (1)A(2) state of phenylnitrene (1b) to 1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraene (3b), ring expansion of 1c to 3c is computed to be quite endothermic.

The Fermi-contact (FC) term probes the first-order density at the positions of the coupling nuclei, whereas the noncontact terms (the paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO) and the spin-dipole (SD) terms) probe the pi character of the C-C bond (the diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO) term can mostly be neglected). A model is tested, in which the value of the FC(CC) term is estimated with the help of measured SSCCs 1J(CH). The difference between the measured J(CC) and the estimated FC(CC) values, delta(CC) = PSO(CC) + SD(CC) + DSO(CC), provides a semiquantitative measure of the pi character of a C-C multiple bond. The applicability and limitations of this approach are discussed by partitioning the four Ramsey terms of the SSCC 1J(CC) into one- and two-orbital contributions. The FC, PSO, and SD terms of 1J(CC) are explained and analyzed with regard to their relationship to other C-C bond properties. It is shown that empirical relationships between measured SSCCs and the s character of a bond need reconsideration.",

In this context, the efficient occlusion of guest nanoparticles within growing host crystals can be regarded as a formidable technical challenge. Indeed, although there are various reports of successful nanoparticle occlusion within inorganic crystals in the literature, robust design rules remain elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of two pairs of sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles with identical compositions but varying particle size, morphology, stabilizer chain length, and stabilizer chain surface density via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). The mean degree of polymerization of the stabilizer chains dictates the spatial distribution of these model anionic nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO<sub3</sub): relatively short stabilizer chains merely result in near-surface occlusion, whereas sufficiently long stabilizer chains are essential to achieve uniform occlusion. This study reconciles the various conflicting literature reports of occluded nanoparticles being either confined to surface layers or uniformly occluded throughout the host matrix and hence provides important new insights regarding the criteria required for efficient nanoparticle occlusion within inorganic crystals.",

Many studies have reported that CCL2 can directly activate cancer cells through a variety of mechanisms. CCL2 can also promote cancer progression indirectly through increasing the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages into the tumor microenvironment. The role of CCL2 in cancer progression has gradually been understood, and various preclinical cancer models elucidate that CCL2 and its receptor C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) are attractive targets for intervention in cancer development. However, clinically available drugs that regulate the CCL2-CCR2 axis as anticancer agents are not available at this time.

CCR2 and its ligands have been extensively studied in a range of inflammatory diseases in the central nervous system (CNS), including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and ischemic stroke. This brief review summarizes our current understanding of the physiologic and pathologic roles of CCR2, focusing on its involvement in CNS inflammatory diseases. There appears to be a rationale for exploring therapies involving CCR2 inhibition in multiple sclerosis and ischemic stroke, but there is also evidence for immunomodulatory and protective effects of CCR2 activity during CNS inflammation. The critical balance between protective and detrimental roles of CCR2-dependent recruitment of leukocytes must therefore be carefully examined to guide safe and effective development of any therapies involving CCR2 modulation.

Here, we investigated whether ClC-2 is the apical Cl- channel associated with gastric acid secretion. Two anti-ClC-2 antibodies used in this study reacted with cloned ClC-2 protein expressed in HEK293 cells. In isolated rabbit gastric glands, significant expression of ClC-2 mRNA was observed, but the presence of ClC-2 protein was not clear. Furthermore, no expression of ClC-2 protein was observed in isolated rat and human gastric mucosa. Immunohistochemistry on the rat gastric mucosa showed no significant expression of ClC-2 protein in the parietal cells which showed abundant expression of H+,K+-ATPase. These results indicate that ClC-2 may not be a Cl- -transporting protein for gastric acid secretion in parietal cells.",

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Most models for polyadenylation invoke cleavage of precursor transcripts at the site of poly(A) addition followed by polymerization of A residues by poly(A) polymerase. Analysis of the sequences surrounding poly(A) addition sites has identified the consensus recognition sequence element AAUAAA as necessary but not sufficient for polyadenylation. A second recognition sequence element CACUG , was observed by Benoit et al. to be adjacent to the site of poly(A) addition in several sequenced RNAs. Here, we analyse 61 vertebrate poly(A) addition sequences, define a more extensive recognition sequence for polyadenylation than previously recognized and suggest how the site of poly(A) addition may be chosen. Furthermore, we find that the defined recognition sequence has elements which are complementary to regions within the small nuclear RNA U4, suggesting that U4 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) may mediate polyadenylation in a fashion similar to the role of U1 snRNPs in splicing. The model invokes hybridization of U4 RNA to AAUAAA recognition elements as related to primary site selection, and hybridization to CAYUG recognition elements as related to cleavage site selection.",

Thus, it is a challenge to develop alternative, milder and cheaper methodologies for the construction of C-N bonds. Herein, we have selected some prime literature reports that may serve this purpose.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Breaking through Immunity's Glass Ceiling.\nA key goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeted to the vulnerable regions of the HIV envelope. BnAbs develop over time in ∼50% of HIV-1-infected individuals. However, to date, no vaccines have induced bnAbs and few or none of these vaccine-elicited HIV-1 antibodies carry the high frequencies of V(D)J mutations characteristic of bnAbs. Do the high frequencies of mutations characteristic of naturally induced bnAbs represent a fundamental barrier to the induction of bnAbs by vaccines? Recent studies suggest that high frequencies of V(D)J mutations can be achieved by serial vaccination strategies. Rather, it appears that, in the absence of HIV-1 infection, physiologic immune tolerance controls, including a germinal center process termed affinity reversion, may limit vaccine-driven bnAb development by clonal elimination or selecting for mutations incompatible with bnAb activity.",

Furthermore, the activating protein 2 (AP-2) expressing CNCC become neural or mesenchymal NCC derivatives whereas the HNK-1 labeled cells do not participate in the mesenchymal lineage. These data provide molecular markers for unique CNCC fates and thus will be invaluable in the characterizing of craniofacial anomalies related to defects in NCCS.

Type 1 narcolepsy (narcolepsy-cataplexy) is associated with the destruction of lateral hypothalamic hypocretin neurons. It is thought that the loss of hypocretin neurons is autoimmune mediated. This is because of the close relationship between type 1 narcolepsy and HLA DQB1∗0602 and the onset of narcolepsy at a young age. Evidence suggests that streptococcal and H1N1 influenza infections (and H1N1 vaccination) may be involved in the pathogenesis of narcolepsy. There are suggestions from genetic and immune studies that the immune system plays a key role in narcolepsy.",

The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Although significant developments have occurred since OCSCs were first described, the involvement of CSCs in ovarian tumor metastasis is not fully understood.

OCCCs often arise from endometriosis associated with strong oxidative stress. Of note, the stress involved in OCCCs can be divided into the following two categories: (a) carcinogenesis from endometriosis to OCCC and (b) factors related to treatment after carcinogenesis. Antioxidants can reduce the risk of OCCC formation by quenching reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, the oxidant stress-tolerant properties assist in the survival of OCCC cells when the malignant transformation has already occurred. Moreover, the acquisition of oxidative stress resistance is also involved in the cancer stemness of OCCC. This review summarizes the recent advances in the process and prevention of carcinogenesis, the characteristic nature of tumors, and the treatment of post-refractory OCCCs, which are highly linked to oxidative stress. Although therapeutic approaches should still be improved against OCCCs, multi-combinatorial treatments including nucleic acid-based drugs directed to the transcriptional profile of each OCCC are expected to improve the outcomes of patients.",

As a basis for the development of therapeutic agents that could improve the prognosis of OCCC, we performed a screen for proteins critical for the tumorigenicity of OCCC using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Here we show that knockdown of the phosphate exporter XPR1/SLC53A1 induces the growth arrest and apoptosis of OCCC cells in vitro. Moreover, we show that knockdown of XPR1/SLC53A1 inhibits the proliferation of OCCC cells xenografted into immunocompromised mice. These results suggest that XPR1/SLC53A1 plays a critical role in the tumorigenesis of OCCC cells.

We performed a PubMed search using the phrase \"clear cell ovarian cancer.\" We reviewed 54 articles referring to OCCC. OCCC patients have a high incidence of stage I disease and frequently present with a large pelvic mass. Recurrences are more frequent with this entity than with other types of EOC. The clinical management of advanced EOC includes maximal cytoreduction and platinum plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. The survival rates of patients with advanced OCCC are lower than those of patients with advanced serous EOC (serous subtype). The poor response rate to platinum-based regimens may be related to the intrinsic chemoresistance of these tumors. Despite their aggressive clinical course, OCCCs are still treated similarly to the other EOCs at the present time, because the rarity of these tumors prevents the conduction of randomized studies. Novel treatment approaches should be adopted in OCCC. Molecular-targeted therapies and effective new agents without cross-resistance to platinum compounds should be evaluated in a prospective clinical trial in OCCC.",

Thirty-eight percent (18/48) of the OCSCCs exhibited a mutation in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. There was a significantly higher incidence of p53 mutations in OCSCCs from tobacco users (predominantly cigarette smokers) compared to those who had never used tobacco. No increase in the incidence of p53 mutation was observed in tobacco users who drank alcohol. G to A transitions and deletions were the predominant mutations observed in OCSCCs from tobacco users. No specific pattern of mutation was observed in OCSCCs from those subjects who had never used tobacco.

We show here, however, that purified C4-bp does not display the previously reported polymorphism. The mapping position of C4BP in the mouse therefore remains undetermined.",

However, the CSC theory is also challenged at least in certain types of cancer. Here we review the progress of CSC studies in HNC, which suggest that HNC conforms to the CSC model.

The quadratic force constants and the stretching potentials of Hn CCHn have been calculated at the CASSCF/cc-pVTZ level. The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The CuII species can be oxidized to CuIII by SET or using a nucleophilic radical for further reductive elimination.

However, concentration ratios of radionuclides from soil to tree species are limited for many radionuclide-tree combinations. To fill this gap, it is investigated in the present paper whether stable element concentration data for leafy vegetables are representative of those for wild tree leaves, and consequently, if these stable element data for leafy vegetables can be used as analogues to describe radionuclides transfer from soil to trees. Data for stable elements in leafy vegetables collected in Japan were compared with those in leaves of about 20 tree species worldwide. The correlation coefficients of element concentrations between leafy vegetables and tree leaves were higher than 0.90 with p &lt; 0.001 by Student's t test, and geometric means of concentration data for most elements were within the range of data for leafy vegetables. Thus, transfer parameters derived from stable element data for leafy vegetables could generally be used to estimate concentrations in tree leaves if data for the latter are not available. However, some trees accumulate a few elements (e.g., Al, Co, Mn and Si) in their leaves to higher concentrations than observed for leafy vegetables.",

In this context, the efficient occlusion of guest nanoparticles within growing host crystals can be regarded as a formidable technical challenge. Indeed, although there are various reports of successful nanoparticle occlusion within inorganic crystals in the literature, robust design rules remain elusive. Herein, we report the synthesis of two pairs of sterically stabilized diblock copolymer nanoparticles with identical compositions but varying particle size, morphology, stabilizer chain length, and stabilizer chain surface density via polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). The mean degree of polymerization of the stabilizer chains dictates the spatial distribution of these model anionic nanoparticles within calcite (CaCO<sub3</sub): relatively short stabilizer chains merely result in near-surface occlusion, whereas sufficiently long stabilizer chains are essential to achieve uniform occlusion. This study reconciles the various conflicting literature reports of occluded nanoparticles being either confined to surface layers or uniformly occluded throughout the host matrix and hence provides important new insights regarding the criteria required for efficient nanoparticle occlusion within inorganic crystals.",

The Fermi-contact (FC) term probes the first-order density at the positions of the coupling nuclei, whereas the noncontact terms (the paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO) and the spin-dipole (SD) terms) probe the pi character of the C-C bond (the diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO) term can mostly be neglected). A model is tested, in which the value of the FC(CC) term is estimated with the help of measured SSCCs 1J(CH). The difference between the measured J(CC) and the estimated FC(CC) values, delta(CC) = PSO(CC) + SD(CC) + DSO(CC), provides a semiquantitative measure of the pi character of a C-C multiple bond. The applicability and limitations of this approach are discussed by partitioning the four Ramsey terms of the SSCC 1J(CC) into one- and two-orbital contributions. The FC, PSO, and SD terms of 1J(CC) are explained and analyzed with regard to their relationship to other C-C bond properties.

Nevertheless, cyclization of 1c, to form the bicyclic intermediate 2c in the ring expansion reaction, is computed to be only slightly more endothermic than the comparable cyclization reaction of 1b to 2b. The origins of these differences between the ring expansion reactions of 1b and 1c have been elucidated through the calculation of the energies of relevant isodesmic reactions.",

A total of 37 cases of LSCC and 54 of OCSCC were compared regarding clinical and microscopic findings. Predominance of head and neck TNM stages (HNTNM) T1-T2 in LSCC and T3-T4 in OCSCC was observed. A significant percentage (33.3%) of patients with OCSCC at HNTNM T1-T2 presented cervical lymph node metastasis and 18.75% died, whereas lymph node metastasis was absent and no patient died with LSCC at HNTNM T1-T2. LSCC demonstrated a higher number of cases with intense peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate compared with OCSCC. The analysis of the proliferative index demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of PCNA+ and Ki-67+ cells in OCSCC compared with LSCC. Our results suggest that OCSCC and LSCC demonstrate distinct clinical and microscopic characteristics that reflect different biologic behavior and prognosis.",

C(4) species have concurrently evolved multiple times in a broad range of plant families, and this multiple and parallel evolution of the complex C(4) trait indicates a common underlying evolutionary mechanism that might be elucidated by comparative analyses of related C(3) and C(4) species. Here, we use mRNA-Seq analysis of five species within the genus Flaveria, ranging from C(3) to C(3)-C(4) intermediate to C(4) species, to quantify the differences in the transcriptomes of closely related plant species with varying degrees of C(4)-associated characteristics. Single gene analysis defines the C(4) cycle enzymes and transporters more precisely and provides new candidates for yet unknown functions as well as identifies C(4) associated pathways. Molecular evidence for a photorespiratory CO(2) pump prior to the establishment of the C(4) cycle-based CO(2) pump is provided.

From the theoretical aspects, a new pathway via isomerization transition state (TS) at 391 ± 8 kJ∕mol is found leading to the CO + CH3NC products. An amount of 60% reactant molecules at 300 K is estimated to successfully surpass the average TS barrier lying above the excitation energy by 3.5 kJ∕mol. Further, a prior distribution method is conducted to characterize the vibrational energy distribution of CO on a statistical basis. The pathway to CH3NC + CO yields a vibrational branching ratio (v = 0:v = 1:v = 2:v = 3∼0.63:0.25:0.093:0.032) in excellent agreement with the observation (0.62:0.25:0.09:0.05). ",

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method.

The Fermi-contact (FC) term probes the first-order density at the positions of the coupling nuclei, whereas the noncontact terms (the paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO) and the spin-dipole (SD) terms) probe the pi character of the C-C bond (the diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO) term can mostly be neglected). A model is tested, in which the value of the FC(CC) term is estimated with the help of measured SSCCs 1J(CH). The difference between the measured J(CC) and the estimated FC(CC) values, delta(CC) = PSO(CC) + SD(CC) + DSO(CC), provides a semiquantitative measure of the pi character of a C-C multiple bond. The applicability and limitations of this approach are discussed by partitioning the four Ramsey terms of the SSCC 1J(CC) into one- and two-orbital contributions. The FC, PSO, and SD terms of 1J(CC) are explained and analyzed with regard to their relationship to other C-C bond properties.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates.

The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The femur molds were fixed with three parallel OCCSs as OCCS group and three parallel HCCSs as HCCS group. All specimens were tested for compressive strength and maximum load to failure with a loading rate of 2 mm/min. The result showed that there was no significant difference with the compressive strength in the Pauwels angle of 50° and 60°. However, we observed that the maximum load to failure with the Pauwels angle of 50°, 60°, and 70° and the compressive strength with 70° of HCCS group showed better performance than the OCCS group.

Other chelating agents assayed, including o-phenanthroline, cannot replace NC in promoting the O2 formation. O2 is also produced by adding NC to a mixture of Cu(II) and H2O2. Concomitant with the O2 evolution, the typical absorbance of the (NC)2Cu(I) complex appears to account for the complete reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I). It is concluded that the addition of H2O2 with Cu(II) produces the equilibrium Cu(II)(O2H)(-)&lt;--&gt; Cu(I.)O2H. Addition of NC shifts the equilibrium to the right side by binding Cu(I). The released O2.- then reacts with the remaining Cu(II) yielding, in the presence of NC, the net reaction of 4 NC + 2 Cu(II) + H2O2 --&gt; 2 (NC)2Cu(I) + O2 + 2 H+. O2 is also released in the absence of added NC provided the H2O2 concentration is increased. In these conditions the Cu(II)(O2H) complex undergoes other reactions leading to the copper-catalysed decomposition of H2O2.",

However, concentration ratios of radionuclides from soil to tree species are limited for many radionuclide-tree combinations. To fill this gap, it is investigated in the present paper whether stable element concentration data for leafy vegetables are representative of those for wild tree leaves, and consequently, if these stable element data for leafy vegetables can be used as analogues to describe radionuclides transfer from soil to trees. Data for stable elements in leafy vegetables collected in Japan were compared with those in leaves of about 20 tree species worldwide. The correlation coefficients of element concentrations between leafy vegetables and tree leaves were higher than 0.90 with p &lt; 0.001 by Student's t test, and geometric means of concentration data for most elements were within the range of data for leafy vegetables. Thus, transfer parameters derived from stable element data for leafy vegetables could generally be used to estimate concentrations in tree leaves if data for the latter are not available. However, some trees accumulate a few elements (e.g., Al, Co, Mn and Si) in their leaves to higher concentrations than observed for leafy vegetables.",

To investigate true functions of rCCN2, glycosylated protein with proper folding needs to be used. Therefore, we use rCCN2 produced by mammalian cells. Conditioned medium (CM) of HeLa cells stably transfected with a CCN2 expression vector are collected, and the recombinant CCN2 protein produced and secreted into the CM is purified by two-step chromatography, first with a heparin affinity column and then with an anti-CCN2 affinity column prepared with a monoclonal antibody against CCN2. The purified rCCN2 shows the bands of 36-38 kDa with sliver staining after gel electrophoresis, which can be confirmed by Western blotting. This chapter describes these methods in detail.",

It was shown that CCl3 radicals add oxygen to form CCl3O2 radicals, which eventually yield three chloride ions and CO2. A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations. The rate constant for the oxygen addition to CCl3 radicals was determined by pulse radiolysis to 3.3 X 10(9) M-1 s-1.

Cyclometalation has proven to be a highly attractive and versatile synthetic method for the formation of organometallic metalacycles. This review intends to describe isolated and well-defined cyclometalated iridium/rhodium complexes that contain a Cp*M-C (M = Ir, Rh) bond stabilised by the intramolecular coordination of neutral donor atoms (N, C, O or P). The formation of metalamacrocycles and cages employing cyclometalated approaches is discussed. In focusing on selected mechanistic insights garnered from iridium/rhodium-catalysed functionalisation of C-H bonds involving cyclometalated complexes, a limited number of substrates will be discussed, but a broad range of mechanistic features is highlighted.

Here, we investigated whether ClC-2 is the apical Cl- channel associated with gastric acid secretion. Two anti-ClC-2 antibodies used in this study reacted with cloned ClC-2 protein expressed in HEK293 cells. In isolated rabbit gastric glands, significant expression of ClC-2 mRNA was observed, but the presence of ClC-2 protein was not clear. Furthermore, no expression of ClC-2 protein was observed in isolated rat and human gastric mucosa. Immunohistochemistry on the rat gastric mucosa showed no significant expression of ClC-2 protein in the parietal cells which showed abundant expression of H+,K+-ATPase. These results indicate that ClC-2 may not be a Cl- -transporting protein for gastric acid secretion in parietal cells.",

Research on prokaryotic CLC homologues provided long-anticipated high-resolution structures as well as the unexpected discovery that some CLCs are not chloride channels, but rather are proton-chloride antiporters. Hence, CLCs encompass two functional classes of transport proteins once thought to be fundamentally different from one another. In this review, we discuss the structural features and molecular mechanisms of CLC channels and antiporters. We focus on ClC-0, the most thoroughly studied CLC channel, and ClC-ec1, the prokaryotic antiporter of known structure. We highlight some striking similarities between these CLCs and discuss compelling questions that remain to be addressed.

In this study, we have elucidated the structure of this novel adduct with the use of mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 13C NMR as a substitution product of a -C(Cl) = CCl2 moiety for a beta-hydrogen atom on the prosthetic heme's ring I vinyl group. From studies with the use of 13C-enriched BrCCl3, it was determined that the added carbon atoms were derived from 2 eq of BrCCl3. A mechanism that involves multiple reductive events and a radical cation heme intermediate is proposed. Consistent with this mechanism, cellular reductants were found to selectively enhance the amount of this novel dissociable heme adduct. These studies reveal fine differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin in the accessibility of reactive intermediates to the ring I vinyl group, as well as the potential importance of cellular reductants on the course of heme alteration.",

In this study, we have used the oocyte expression system to determine whether the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters (KCCs) can also transport NH4(+) and whether they play a role in pH regulation. Our results demonstrate that all of the CCCs examined (NKCC1, NKCC2, KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4) can promote NH4(+) translocation, presumably through binding of the ion at the K(+) site. Moreover, kinetic studies for both NKCCs and KCCs suggest that NH4(+) is an excellent surrogate of Rb(+) or K(+) and that NH4(+) transport and cellular acidification resulting from CCC activity are relevant physiologically. In this study, we have also found that CCCs are strongly and differentially affected by changes in intracellular pH (independently of intracellular [NH4(+)]). Indeed, NKCC2, KCC1, KCC2, and KCC3 are inhibited at intracellular pH &lt;7.5, whereas KCC4 is activated. These results indicate that certain CCC isoforms may be specialized to operate in acidic environments. CCC-mediated NH4(+) transport could bear great physiological implication given the ubiquitous distribution of these carriers.",

ICS are now considered as first-line therapy in all asthma treatment guidelines. Over the past decade there has been clarification of the dose-response relationship with ICS and confirmation of the general long-term efficacy and safety of these drugs in both adults and children. Recent work has focused on simplifying dosing regimens and investigating flexibility of dosing. Moreover, ICS can be used in combination with other agents such as long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists to provide effective asthma control in patients with persistent asthma not adequately controlled on ICS alone. Thus, ICS remain the cornerstone of modern asthma therapy.",

In recent years, it has been shown that in many types of cancers a subset of cells show peculiar characteristics, such as the ability to induce tumors when engrafted into host animals, self-renew and being immortal, and give rise to a differentiated progeny. These cells have been defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells. CSCs can be isolated both from tumor specimens and established cancer cell lines on the basis of their ability to exclude fluorescent dyes, express specific cell surface markers or grow in particular culture conditions. A key feature of CSCs is their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, which could contribute to the remaining of residual cancer cells after therapeutic treatments. It has been shown that CSC-like cells can be isolated after drug treatment of cancer cell lines; in this review, we will describe the strategies so far applied to identify and isolate CSCs. Furthermore, we will discuss the possible use of these selected populations to investigate CSC biology and develop new anticancer drugs. ",

Molecular constants including the hyperfine interaction constants of CH2=CCHO in the (2)A(″) ground electronic state were precisely determined. Ab initio calculations indicate that CH2=CCHO has a linear C-C-C backbone with Cs symmetry, where the formyl group is in the Cs plane and perpendicular to the methylene group. The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom. The ground state CH2=CCHO can, thus, be described as taking the formylvinyl (CH2=Ċ-CH=O) form rather than as the allenyloxy (CH2=C=CH-Ȯ) form. ",

With most of the molecules, there is fairly good agreement between the results from the two methods, and EOM-CCSD gives good agreement with the available experimental data. A detailed discussion of the lowest-lying singlet excited states in CO2 and CS2 is presented, highlighting the pronounced differences in electronic character and equilibrium structure displayed by these isovalent species. The origins of the structural distortions that are frequently found for the adiabatic excited states are examined with the aid of deformation density plots and the electron localization function (ELF).",

Theoretical calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory show that the cationic rearrangements occur by stepwise processes via key rhombic structures. Overall, the degenerate processes result in O and S migration from C-3 to C-1.

Complex 6.PhCN.H(2)O crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pbca with (at -154 degrees C) a = 22.603(4) Å, b = 34.759(6) Å, c = 18.167(3) Å, and Z = 8. The complexes contain [Co(4)O(2)(OH)(2)](6+) (5) and [Co(4)O(3)(OH)](5+) (6) distorted-cubane cores, the sites of protonation being apparent by (i) the approach of ClO(4)(-) or [Ce(NO(3))(6)](3)(-) anions to within hydrogen-bonding distances (O.O approximately 2.7 Å) and (ii) the longer Co-OH(-) bond lengths compared with Co-O(2)(-) bond lengths. Peripheral ligation is provided by chelating bpy and syn,syn-bridging RCO(2)(-) groups. The Co(III) atoms are six-coordinate and approximately octahedral. Solution studies show that the diprotonated species is a strong diprotic acid analogous to H(2)SO(4); the first deprotonation goes to completion, but the monoprotonated species is a weak acid and is in equilibirium with the nonprotonated species. pH studies in aqueous solution yield a pK(a2) value of 3.15 for the second deprotonation. Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution. The combined results demonstrate that the [Co(4)O(4)](4+) core is capable of acting as a Brønsted base, undergoing either one or two protonation reactions.",

The experimental first vertical ionization potential for CH(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), and CCl(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2) was determined to be 10.91, 11.42, and 11.07 eV, respectively. In this study, the rule of the conformation properties of anhydride XC(O)OC(O)Y was improved by analyzing the different conformations of anhydrides with various substitutes.",

Our study indicates that spin-forbidden reactions are the probable pathways in the reactions with N atoms, whereas spin-allowed reactions are the dominant processes in the reactions with O atoms. The major factor influencing the reaction rate constants of anions with N and O atoms is whether a spin-allowed barrierless pathway exists.

Thus, these studies demonstrate at least one mechanism by which cohesin can control gene expression.",

Despite the fundamental role of this step, direct measurements of binding to transporters are rare. We investigated ion binding and selectivity in CLC-ec1, a H(+)-Cl(-) exchanger of the CLC family of channels and transporters. Cl(-) affinity depends on the conformation of the protein: it is highest with the extracellular gate removed and weakens as the transporter adopts the occluded configuration and with the intracellular gate removed. The central ion-binding site determines selectivity in CLC transporters and channels. A serine-to-proline substitution at this site confers NO(3)(-) selectivity upon the Cl(-)-specific CLC-ec1 transporter and CLC-0 channel. We propose that CLC-ec1 operates through an affinity-switch mechanism and that the bases of substrate specificity are conserved in the CLC channels and transporters.",

Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

CCL2 can also promote cancer progression indirectly through increasing the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages into the tumor microenvironment.

The Fermi-contact (FC) term probes the first-order density at the positions of the coupling nuclei, whereas the noncontact terms (the paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO) and the spin-dipole (SD) terms) probe the pi character of the C-C bond (the diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO) term can mostly be neglected). A model is tested, in which the value of the FC(CC) term is estimated with the help of measured SSCCs 1J(CH). The difference between the measured J(CC) and the estimated FC(CC) values, delta(CC) = PSO(CC) + SD(CC) + DSO(CC), provides a semiquantitative measure of the pi character of a C-C multiple bond. The applicability and limitations of this approach are discussed by partitioning the four Ramsey terms of the SSCC 1J(CC) into one- and two-orbital contributions. The FC, PSO, and SD terms of 1J(CC) are explained and analyzed with regard to their relationship to other C-C bond properties.

CCN2 consists of four domains, and identification of new proteins that bind to individual domains of CCN2 may reveal a variety of CCN2 functions. To identify CCN2-interactive proteins that regulate CCN2 activity, we carried out GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid screening with a cDNA library derived from a chondrocytic cell line, HCS-2/8, with CCN2 cDNA used as a bait. In this chapter, we describe our methods for screening for CCN2 binding partners by this system in detail. This protocol may be applied to other CCN proteins as well.",

Drugs targeting CCN2 action may therefore prove to be useful anti-fibrotic approaches. CCN2 acts via integrins and heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycans (HSPGs). In a recent study, Vial and colleagues (2011) show that decorin can bind CCN2. A peptide corresponding to the leucine rich repeats peptide 12 region of decorin can neutralize CCN2-mediated activity on C2C12 cells in vitro. Thus it is conceivable that this peptide could be used in the future as a novel antifibrotic approach.",

In recent years, it has been shown that in many types of cancers a subset of cells show peculiar characteristics, such as the ability to induce tumors when engrafted into host animals, self-renew and being immortal, and give rise to a differentiated progeny. These cells have been defined as cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor initiating cells. CSCs can be isolated both from tumor specimens and established cancer cell lines on the basis of their ability to exclude fluorescent dyes, express specific cell surface markers or grow in particular culture conditions. A key feature of CSCs is their resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, which could contribute to the remaining of residual cancer cells after therapeutic treatments. It has been shown that CSC-like cells can be isolated after drug treatment of cancer cell lines; in this review, we will describe the strategies so far applied to identify and isolate CSCs. Furthermore, we will discuss the possible use of these selected populations to investigate CSC biology and develop new anticancer drugs. ",

Therefore, the development of methods for the isolation of CSC is a key step to explore the mechanisms underlying CSC maintenance.

Herein, we demonstrate an efficient route to access related complexes with tetradentate CCCN and pentadentate CCCCN and NCCCN cores by successive modification of the coordinating atoms in complexes with a CCCC core. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the rich reactivity of metal-carbon bonds and the inherent aromaticity of the metallacyclic skeletons play key roles in these transformations. This strategy addresses the paucity of synthetic approaches to mixed N/C planar pentadentate chelating species and provides valuable insights into the synthesis of carbon-based high-coordinate complexes. Furthermore, the resulting complexes are the examples of organometallic species with combined photoacoustic, photothermal, and sonodynamic properties, which makes them promising for application in related areas.",

Even though various environmental chemicals have been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes as well as other autoimmune diseases, the possibility that environmental chemicals may contribute to the development of T1D has not been adequately evaluated. There is preliminary epidemiological evidence that exposure to certain chemicals, such as N-nitroso compounds, air pollutants and persistent organic pollutants is associated with T1D. Environmental chemicals that can act as endocrine disruptors may affect the development and function of the immune system in ways that could promote autoimmunity, and thereby contribute to the development of T1D. As such, the potential low-dose effects of chemicals should be considered in both epidemiological and experimental study designs of T1D. If chemicals indeed contribute to the development of T1D, then this disease may be partly preventable.",

An ab initio study at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory indicates that (i) triplet NCCCCCN is the ground state with a T/S energy gap of -14.9 kcal mol(-1); (ii) the structures of triplet and singlet NCCCCCN need to be described by molecular obital theory, and a simple valence bond approach cannot be used for this system; and (iii) there are several possible routes by which an energized neutral may lose carbon, but the major route involves the triplet nitrile to isonitrile rearrangement NCCCCCN --&gt; CNCCCCN --&gt; NCCCCN + C.",
