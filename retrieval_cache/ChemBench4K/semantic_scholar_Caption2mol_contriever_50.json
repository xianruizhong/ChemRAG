Aflatoxins are an interesting example of DNA damaging agents from a natural source. The detrimental effects of aflatoxins are due to their ability to bind covalently to DNA. The DNA damage leads to mutagenesis followed by possible cellular dysfunction. These naturally occurring mycotoxins are highly toxic and exceedingly carcinogenic. Aflatoxins are among the most potent liver carcinogens known. 1-4 At least 13 different types of aflatoxins are produced in nature. Aflatoxins are a particular concern as food contaminates. Aflatoxins are found naturally in plant or animal derived food products with mold growth, particularly when foodstuffs are stockpiled. Their toxic derivatives can also occur as indirect contaminants in animal products. Human exposure is usually the result of food consumption, particularly peanuts.",

This mycotoxin exhibits striking estrogenic and anabolic properties in human and animal resulting in severe effects on the reproductive system. Fumonisins (FBs) are a group of structurally related toxic metabolites produced by Fusarium species. They occur at high incidence in corn and corn products all over the world. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is the predominant metabolite, followed by Fumonisin B2 (FB2) and Fumonisin B3. FB1 is known to cause a range of species-specific toxic responses, including leukoencephalomalacia in horses, pulmonary oedema in swine, and hepatosis and nephrotoxicity in rodents. FB1 is carcinogenic for female mice and male rats.\n\nAflatoxins (AFLAs) are naturally related mycotoxins produced by numerous Aspergillus species. About 20 compounds have been described, but only Aflatoxin B1 (AFLA B1), Aflatoxin B2 (AFLA B2), Aflatoxin G1 (AFLA G1) and Aflatoxin G2 (AFLA G2) occurs in food commodities. AFLA B1 is the most toxic aflatoxin. When lactating cattle and other animals ingest aflatoxins in contaminated feed, toxic metabolites such as Aflatoxin M1 (AFLA M1) can be formed and transmitted to milk. This hydroxylated form is a potentially important contaminant in dairy products. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified aflatoxins as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).",

Chen et al. [27] managed to use structural information from conventional simple molecules to predict targets for natural products and macrocyclic ligands. Even though these models can achieve fairly high accuracy in a test set, their predicted results for natural products remain unsubstantiated. Knowledge about natural products themselves has not been extracted or learned. The difference between the structures of natural products and those of synthetic compounds requires different ways to predict targets. A prediction model that specially targets natural products is in demand but has not been developed yet.\n\nIn this study, we adapt the transfer learning method to a deep learning algorithm, multilayer perceptron (MLP), in order to predict the targets of natural products. To apply our training methods to natural products, we first train a deep learning model on the ChEMBL dataset with natural products removed. With the knowledge from a much larger dataset, the model can learn the basic relationship between structures and targets. Then, the model is fine-tuned using a natural product dataset with a higher learning rate and some of the parameters frozen. After this step, the model acquires the ability to predict targets of different compounds and to adjust its parameters to fit the specific distribution of natural products. The AUROC score showed that the transfer learning step optimized the model's performance on the natural products test set. The model can be used as a powerful tool to assist drug design based on the structure of natural products.\n\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n\nHyperparameters Optimization of the Pre-Trained Model",

In many countries, regulatory agencies monitor for these toxins and have established toxin-level thresholds that help ensure seafood consumer safety. For example, the European Union has set a limit of 160 µg/kg OA equivalents in shellfish meat, below which the product is deemed safe for human consumption. Since the potencies of each analog within a toxin class may vary, equivalents, or toxic equivalence factors (TEFs), are used to account for these differences. For the OA/DTX toxin class, TEFs have been determined via lethal doses in mice. According to expert opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), derived TEFs for the OA/DTX class are: OA = 1, DTX1 = 1, DTX2 = 0.6. For DTX3 the TEF values are equal to those of the corresponding unesterified toxins (OA, DTX1, and DTX2) [22].",

The dinoflagellate origin of this acid and its analogs was soon revealed by the authors [I]. The most prominent feature of okadaic acid is its potent and specific action to inhibit protein phosphatases type 2A, I, and 2B [12]. Because many biological events, including tumor promotion, are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of signal proteins, the acid is extensively used in biochemical studies. Okadaic acid and its analogs produced by planktonic dinoflagellates Dinophysis spp. are accumulated by bivalve shellfish and cause worldwide human intoxication named diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. Dinophysisfortii produces another polyether macrolide, pectenotoxin-2, in addition to okadaic acid. Though pectenotoxin-2 shows potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells of human origin, its hepatotoxicity prohibits its potential use for therapeutic purpose.\n\nThe three toxins shown in Fig. 5 are examples which show the extraordinarily complex structures of marine toxins. Maitotoxin is the largest (Mw 3422) and the most complex molecule so far elucidated. The lethality of the toxin to mice by intraperitoneal injection is 50 nglkg, a value that is only exceeded by a few proteinaceous toxins of bacteria. Maitotoxin specifically induces calcium-ion influx through cell membranes. Almost all cell lines tested were sensitive to the toxin. Thus, maitotoxin has been used to explore the cell phenomena triggered by calcium-",

Toxins responsible for DSP intoxication belong to the group of the lipophilic marine biotoxins. The main cause of worldwide DSP syndrome (Yasomotor et al., 1993) are okadaic acid (OA) and its derivatives named dinophysistoxins (DTXs). These toxins have been shown to be potent phosphatase inhibitors, a property which can cause inflammation of the intestinal tract and diarrhea. OA and its 35-methyl derivative named dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1) (Figure 1) have also been shown to have tumors-promoting activity (Sylvaine et al., 2002). In order to prevent human intoxication, many monitoring program of shellfish toxicity have been established in many developed countries. According to the current regulation with respect to this issue, the maximum permitted level for marketable shellfish is 0.16 μg OA equivalent/g shellfish meat (Emilia et al., 2008).",

In many countries, regulatory agencies monitor for these toxins and have established toxin-level thresholds that help ensure seafood consumer safety. For example, the European Union has set a limit of 160 μg/kg OA equivalents in shellfish meat, below which the product is deemed safe for human consumption. Since the potencies of each analog within a toxin class may vary, equivalents, or toxic equivalence factors (TEFs), are used to account for these differences. For the OA/DTX toxin class, TEFs have been determined via lethal doses in mice. According to expert opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), derived TEFs for the OA/DTX class are: OA = 1, DTX1 = 1, DTX2 = 0.6. For DTX3 the TEF values are equal to those of the corresponding unesterified toxins (OA, DTX1, and DTX2) [22].\n\nIt is well established that OA is a protein phosphatase 2a and 1 inhibitor [8,18] with molecular modeling supporting this activity [11,15]. It has also been shown that OA inhibits PP5 [23,24]  All data (mean ± SE; n = 3 or 4) were normalized to the control.

These DSP toxins include the polyketide inhibitors okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-4 which are produced by dinoflagellates. Other natural protein phosphatase inhibitors include cyclic peptide inhibitors such as microcystins and nodularins, as well as calyculin and tautomycin (Gupta et al., 1997). The toxins, though structurally dissimilar from one another, all seem to bind at the active site of each phosphatase, where they contact multiple residues near the active site (Suganuma et al., 1989). A free carboxyl and hydroxyl group in the molecule is essential for receptor binding in the case of okadaic acid (see Figure 3). These moieties are important for such compounds to bind to a receptorial site on PP 1 and PP2A, thus inhibiting their activity and interfering with signal transduction processes, including ion channel regulation (Sasaki, K. et al., 1994).  (Catterall, W. A. , 1997).\n\nAs the diarrheic effect of okadaic acid and related toxins has been attributed to the accumulation of phosphorylated proteins that control sodium secretion in intestinal cells, a detection method for such cathartic compounds based on the inhibition of protein phosphatases is of particular interest. Using the specific inhibition of both PPl and PP2A catalytic subunits provides a sensitive method to detect diarrhetic shellfish poisoning. Recently, a highly sensitive fluorometric assay for DSP using PP 1 and PP2A was developed in Dr. Y.",

Okadaic acid is held responsible for promoting the tumor on rat skin following local applications and its presence in drinking water induces the formation of tumours in the stomach of rats. Accurate pharmacologica studies have proposed an action mechanism for Okadaic acid and its derivatives, based on inactivation of the function of the tumor suppressor gene function, through hyperphosphorylation, especially at the level of serine and threonine residues, due to inhibition of certain phosphatases. It is likely to result in a build-up of phosphorylated proteins, which are then involved in the promotion of the tumour [10,11].\n\nDSP toxins are stable to heat, although prolonged boiling can decrease the concentration of Okadaic acid within shellfish. Most of the DSP syndromes have occurred in Japan where shellfish cultivation is widespread and along the eastern and western coasts of North America linked to the \"Red Tides\" produced by Dinoflagellates. In fact, in addition to Okadaic acid, responsible for DSP syndrome is Prorocentrum minimum ( Figure 6) an algae that contains Venerupin, a substance of which the structure is not yet known, but harmful for the liver, which has caused shellfish poisoning resulting in gastrointestinal diseases in the humans. This species, in addition to being responsible for many deaths among humans, is responsible for the remarkable killings of shellfish in Japan, in the Gulf of Mexico, in Florida [12][13][14]. This algae, in addition to promoting very large red tides due to its high productivity, is also very resistant to changes in temperature and salinity. It has recently been found in the Mediterranean Sea and in particular along the coasts of Adriatic Sea.",

Diarrhetic shellfish poison (DSP) is one important type of marine biotoxin which poisons aquatic drinking water and causes intense diarrhea and severe abdominal pains. 110 Acidic toxins like okadaic acid and its derivative dinophysistoxin-1 are highly toxic molecular pollutants originating from DSP. A magnetic β-ketoenamine COF (o-toluidine as a C 2 linker) was successfully applied for the removal of both okadaic acid and dinophysistoxin-1 from marine water. 111 The MCOF extracted okadaic acid with a maximum adsorption capacity of 812 mg g −1 and dinophysistoxin-1 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 530 mg g −1 . The removal efficiency is much better compared to commonly used macroporous resins.

The Y49 (4-(6-aminocarbonyl-8-oxidanylidene-9-phenyl-7H-purin-2yl)benzoic acid) is made of three aromatic rings: a purine ring with two phenyl moieties attached to it, and polar groups present at the rings, with polar groups at different positions. The selected phenalenones have a nucleus made of three-fused rings substituted with multiple OH and carbonyl groups. Based on their structures, both the phenalenones and Y49 were expected to have a similar 3D conformation in the binding pocket. The PDB file of the 7BU4 crystal structure was downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB) [58], which was then prepared and minimized using Schrodinger's Protein Preparation wizard [59][60][61].\n\nThe docking process started by generating a grid box around the binding site of the co-crystallized ligand to locate the pocket where the docking of the compounds occurs. A receptor-Grid-Generation tool in Maestro [62] was utilized for that purpose.",

Among the species, X. exigua displayed a high number of metabolites with bioactivity, followed by X. testudinaria, X. bergquistia, X. ashmorica, X. vansoesti, and X. muta. Despite the potential application, there is still limited knowledge about Xestospongia spp. and the metabolites they produce. To address this knowledge gap, Southeast Asian nations must collaborate on research. The primary objectives of the research should be the identification, classification, and biosynthetic and biotechnological potential of natural compounds from Xestospongia spp.\n\nThe efficiency of the bioactive secondary metabolites discovered in Xestospongia spp. must also be determined by clinical study. Additionally, the generation of metabolites by the host sponge and its microbial population must also be investigated individually to confirm the source of these metabolites, which will not only assist in establishing the origin of the metabolites but also shed light on the sponge's host microbial community's biochemistry.\n\nFurther, to aid future identification and metabolomics studies, a mass spectrometry database for Xestospongia spp. related metabolites should be established. This will provide a valuable resource for researchers studying these species, allowing for rapid identification and characterization of new natural products.\n\nOverall, further research on Xestospongia spp. is necessary to fully understand the potential of these species and their secondary metabolites. \n\n\nConclusions",

In bond line notation, heptanoic acid consists of nine atoms and eight bonds. Removing one bond and one atom on either end of the molecule results in three distinct substructures with eight atoms and seven bonds. Repeating this procedure with these three substructures yields four new substructures with seven atoms and six bonds. The removal of one atom and the adjacent bond can be continued until only fragments with one bond and two atoms remain. For heptanoic acid exists three distinct fragments with one bond and two atoms. Every fragment with any bond count is similar to its parent molecule. Glucose is an important biomolecule. Figure 3 shows glucose and some of its smaller substructures. Two substructures (A and B) are shown in both bent and elongated forms. These subgraphs were created from parent ring fragments by removing a bond without removing an atom.",

The ascidian polysaccharide has a distinctive structure, composed of repetitive disaccharide units of 6-O-sulfo-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(2-O-sulfo-␣-L-idopyranosyluronic acid)-␤-D-galactose. It differs from mammalian dermatan sulfate in its sulfation at both the 2-position of the iduronic acid unit and the 6-position of the N-acetylgalactosamine unit, and the absence of sulfation at position 4 of the hexosamine residue. This unique glycosaminoglycan may help to determine the structural requirement for the anticoagulant activity of dermatan sulfate and specifically for the binding to heparin cofactor II.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES",

By careful comparison of NMR data of 5 with those of pleuropyrone A, it was found that the only difference was the presence of an additional methoxy signal. It was suggested that 5 was an 8-O-methylated derivative of pleuropyrone A, which was further confirmed by the HMBC correlation from the methoxy group to C-8.

They have been carried out outside Kurdistan, mostly by research groups working in Turkey, Iran, and India, where the same plants are commonly used in the local traditional medicine. The results of these investigations have been summarized in the first part of this inaugural paper on secondary metabolites from Verbascum plants occurring in Kurdistan. The literature reported in Reaxys and Google Scholar databases until April 2020 has been reviewed. In the second part of this paper, we describe the preliminary results of our study on the content of a methanol extract of V. calvum flowers.\n\n\nLiterature Data about the Verbascum Species Growing in Kurdistan\n\nMany natural products, belonging to different biosynthetic pathways (terpenoids, shikimic acid derivatives and mixed metabolites), have been described in the only four Verbascum species growing in Kurdistan that have been investigated so far: Verbascum cheiranthifolium Boiss., Verbascum songaricum Schrenk, Verbascum speciosum Schrad. and Verbascum thapsus L. These results, together with the plant traditional uses and the known biological activities, are listed in Table 1 [14]. Several Verbascum species have been reported to exhibit antiseptic, astringent, demulcent, emollient, expectorant, sedative, diuretic, antimalarial properties. Included in different traditional medicines, these plants are used for treating wounds, haemorrhoids, chilblains, respiratory ailments, inflammations, migraine, arthritic problems, acne, eczema and other types of inflammatory skin conditions [15]. Numerous Verbascum species grow wild in various ecosystems existing in territories extending from Aegean Islands to Anatolia and Iran. A total of twenty-seven species can be found in Iraq, mainly on high-mountain regions [16,17], whereas about fifteen are reported to grow in Kurdistan.  [2].",

The general process is illustrated in Figure 3. Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed. The oligosaccharide can then be functionalized for further study.",

The actual disaccharides in the chain are calculated from the total disaccharide composition, and these disaccharides (except for G0A0) are placed into a selection pool. A disaccharide is randomly selected from the pool, and a position on the chain is randomly chosen (step 2). If G0A0 exists in the selected chain position and Nunsubstituted glucosamine is not on the upstream side (farther from the tetrasaccharide-protein linkage), the selected disaccharide replaces G0A0. If N-unsubstituted glucosamine is on the upstream side of the position, the selected disaccharide must contain glucuronic acid in order to replace G0A0. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, another position is randomly chosen for the disaccharide until a successful replacement occurs.",

The genus Walsura (Meliaceae), comprising about 16 species, distributes in subtropical regions such as Southern China, India, and Indonesia [3]. In previous literature, kinds of natural products such as triterpenoids, phenols, and steroids have been identified in this genus. Some triterpenoids and phenols exhibited cell protection, antioxidation and antimalarial activities [4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14]. However, the chemical constituents from Walsura robusta and their activities study are few. We reported herein the isolation, characterization as well as cytotoxic activity of these highly oxidized limonoids and a plausible biosynthesis pathway of 5 and 6.\n\n\nResults and discussion\n\nThe MeOH extract of Walsura yunnanensis was filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford a residue, which was then defatted by petroleum ether and extracted with EtOAc. The EtOAc fraction was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel, ODS, HPLC, and Sephadex LH-20 to yield compounds 1-6 (detailed procedures see Extraction and Isolation part).\n\nWalsurobustone A (1) was isolated as a white amorphous powder. Its molecular formula was determined to be C 28 H 38 O 9 by the [M + Na] + ion peak at m/z 541.2418 (calcd 541.2413 for C 28 H 38 O 9 Na) in the HRESIMS, with 16 mass units less than that of the known compound yunnanol A, isolated from the congener plant Page 2 of 8 Hou et al.

Lipids form a hydrophobic barrier that separates cells and organelles from the environment [15,16]. The core building block of fatty acids is a hydrocarbon chain with a carboxyl group (-COOH) located on its terminal end. Based on the chain length of fatty acids, they are classified as: short-chain (aliphatic tails of up to 5 or even 7 carbons), medium-chain (aliphatic tails of 6-8 up to 12-14 carbons), long-chain (aliphatic tails of 13-18 up to 22 carbons), or very long-chain fatty acids (aliphatic tails longer than 22 carbons; >C22) [17][18][19][20][21]. Most often, the number of carbon atoms in the plant tissues is between 14 and 24. Moreover, the aliphatic chain can be saturated (saturated fatty acid, SFA) or unsaturated (unsaturated fatty acid, UFA), where all carbon-carbon linkages form single bonds, or some carbons are matched by one or more double bonds, respectively. In addition, UFA can be divided into monounsaturated (monoenoic) fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with exactly one or at least two double bonds, respectively [22,23]. Fatty acids are the building blocks of lipids.\n\n\nNomenclature of Fatty Acids",

The human mammary gland is capable of synthesizing SFA primarily of 10 to 14 carbons chain. The fatty acids of more than 16 carbon chain are not synthesized in the mammary gland and must be obtained either from diet or mobilized from fat deposits of the body [26].",

The hydroxyl groups at C2, C5, C10, and C14 are esterified with four acetic acid residues. The order of attachment of acyl fragments to the diterpene backbone was determined by interpreting the results of the 1 H-13 C HMBC experiment (Figure 4). The stereochemistry of substituents in the molecule of compound I was determined based on the analysis of the spin-spin coupling constants of the corresponding protons and their comparison with the published data (Supplementary Table S2) [27][28][29]32]. Thus, the interpretation of the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of the compound I and analysis of the literature data [27][28][29]32] suggest that this taxoid has the structure of 7βhydroxy-2α,5α,10β,14β-tetraacetoxy-4(20),11-taxadiene ( Figure 4) and corresponds to 7βhydroxy-taxuyunnanine C, which was first isolated from T. cuspidata cell culture [32]. The described structure is also consistent with the results of high-resolution mass spectrometry of the isolated taxoid: the formula C 28 H 40 O 9 is confirmed by the presence of a signal of the [M + Na] + adduct ion at m/z 543.2572 in the spectra of positive ions of this compound (calculated value m/z 543.2565). 7β-Hydroxy-taxuyunnanine C can be classified as a rare and/or unusual taxoid: it is one of a few 14-hydroxylated taxoids having a hydroxyl group at the C7 position of 4(20),11-taxadiene; only two taxoids with a similar structure are currently known [1][2][3][4]. There is only one report on discovering this taxoid first isolated from T. cuspidata callus cell culture [32]. Thus, 7β-hydroxy-taxuyunnanine C was detected for the first time",

This substance can keep tubulin stable and inhibit cell mitosis, exhibiting a strong radio-sensitizing effect [2]. There is a good evidence that taxol is a potent drug against various cancers. As a result, taxol has been applied alone or with other anticancer agents to treat breast, ovarian, and lung cancers [2,3]. To date, more than 400 taxoids and modified taxoids have been isolated for characterization from the bark, seeds, and leaves of the genus Taxus [4,5].\n\nEach Taxus species has its unique properties and, thus, a particular way of use. Most plants in the Taxus family are endangered evergreen trees or shrubs that grow rather slowly [1,5]. Of the various Taxus species, three are mainly used in northeastern China, namely, Taxus chinensis (T. chinensis, N), Taxus cuspidata (T. cuspidata, D), and Taxus × media (T. media, M). T. chinensis is an evergreen conifer native to China, where it is also referred to as \"Beauteous Taxus\" [6]. It grows across southeastern China, including Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Taiwan [5].",

For this and all the following molecules we were using the bond line notation, where vertices and the ends of each line represent carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms attached to them are not shown. In bond line notation, heptanoic acid consists of nine atoms and eight bonds. Removing one bond and one atom on either end of the molecule results in three distinct substructures with eight atoms and seven bonds. Repeating this procedure with these three substructures yields four new substructures with seven atoms and six bonds. The removal of one atom and the adjacent bond can be continued until only fragments with one bond and two atoms remain. For heptanoic acid exists three distinct fragments with one bond and two atoms. Every fragment with any bond count is similar to its parent molecule. Glucose is an important biomolecule. Figure 3 shows glucose and some of its smaller substructures. Two substructures (A and B) are shown in both bent and elongated forms. These subgraphs were created from parent ring fragments by removing a bond without removing an atom.",

Inhalation permits effective delivery of the drugs in high concentration to target sites within the lung, minimizing systemic exposure [1]. Combinational therapy of mometasone furoate (MOM) and formoterol fumarate (FOR) has been used in the treatment of COPD and asthma as it produces the additive effects for improving the symptoms, lung functions and reduces exacerbation in patient [2]. MOM ( fig. 1) is a white crystalline powder, soluble in acetone, dichloromethane and slightly soluble in ethanol and a highly potent synthetic chlorinated glucocorticosteriod [3]. FOR ( fig. 2) is a white crystalline, soluble in ethanol and methanol, slightly soluble in water, practically insoluble in acetonitrile. It appears to be more effective than shorter acting β2 agoinst in the treatment of nocturnal and exercise induced asthma. Moreover, it acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator [4]. The literature survey reveals that several analytical methods have been published for the estimation of MOM alone and in combination with other drugs like fusidic acid [5], oxymetazoline [6] terbinafine HCl, nadifloxacin [7], eberconazole nitrate [8], miconazole, hydrocortisone [9], ketoconazole [10], salicylic acid [12] etc. Some of these methods include HPLC, GC, supercritical fluid chromatography and UV spectrophotometry. Various methods have also been reported for the estimation of FOR alone [13] and in combination with other drugs like budesonide [14,16], tiotropium bromide [15] including HPLC, GC, and UV spectrophotometry [13][14][15][16][17].\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS",

(Apiaceae) encompasses a diverse array of plant species known for their aromatic and medicinal properties, and it is almost exclusively native to Europe and eastern Asia [1].Species of this genus are well-known for their over 2000-year long usage in traditional Chinese medicine as \"liver tonics\", for the treatment of feverproducing infections, common cold, inflammatory disorders, hepatitis, etc. [2,3] Radix Bupleuri is the most frequently mentioned ingredient of these preparations, and is derived from the dried roots of Bupleurum chinense DC. and Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd., although many other Bupleurum species are also used under the same name (Bupleurum falcatum L. and Bupleurum yinchowense R.H.Shan and Yin Li).It has been found to possess anti-inflammatory [3], antiviral [4], antidepressant [5], antitumor [6], hepatoprotective [7], and immunoregulatory activities [8].\n\nThe chemical composition of plant species belonging to this genus has been extensively studied.Triterpene saikosaponins are the primary active constituents of these plants, responsible for a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities in preparations containing Radix Bupleuri [1].Polyacetylenes constitute a significant group of compounds found in plants of the Apiaceae family, exhibiting anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anticancer, and antifungal properties, although some have been identified as toxic [9].Bupleurum longiradiatum, widely distributed in northeastern China and available in certain herb markets, is a toxic plant primarily containing the toxic polyacetylenes: bupleurotoxin and acetylbupleurotoxin, compounds absent in other Bupleurum species [9].Therefore, the polyacetylene profile can serve as a distinguishing feature among species within this genus.",

The clinical efficacy of the two bupleurum species is different. The difference in clinical efficacy is closely related to the composition of plant metabolites. In order to analyze the difference in metabolites, we used liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for untargeted metabolome and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for widely targeted metabolome to detect the roots (R), stems (S), leaves (L), and flowers (F) of two varieties, and detected 1,818 metabolites in 25 classes. We performed a statistical analysis of metabolites. Differential metabolites were screened by foldchange and variable importance in the projection values of the OPLS-DA model, and significant differences were found among different groups. The content of active components (triterpenoid saponins) was found to be high in the BcR group than in the BsR group. Other pharmacological metabolites were significantly different. By Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation and enrichment analysis, we found that differential metabolites of the aboveground parts mainly concentrated in monoterpenoid biosynthesis, while the differential metabolites of the root mainly concentrated in sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis. Differences in metabolic networks may indirectly affect the metabolic profile of Bc and Bs, leading to differences in clinical efficacy. Our study provides a scientific basis for subsequent biosynthesis pathway and related bioactivity research, and provides a reference for developing non-medicinal parts and guiding the clinical application of Bupleuri Radix.

Urea also assists the dissolution in aqueous media of difficult-to-dissolve polymers, such as cellulose [3,4]. The mechanism of urea action and the structure in aqueous urea solutions remain contentious. Some studies have indicated that urea acts as a water structure breaker [2,[5][6][7], other studies suggest that urea enhances the water structure and acts as a weak water structure maker [8,9], and few studies reported that urea has no effect on the water structure [10][11][12][13][14]. The controversy on the effect of urea on the water structure network arises partly because experimental techniques do not measure urea-water hydrogen bond interactions directly, but they require an interpretation of the water structure network based on theoretical models with some approximations.",

If a cleavage occurs, the peptide corresponding to the left part of the original sequence until the cleavage position is generated and the current position is kept in memory. Note that the original sequence is not truncated, as potential future cleavage points may require information from previous amino acids (for example, staphylococcalpeptidase-I, see Rule 1). When another cleavage occurs, the new peptide will be generated from the previous stored position until the current cleavage position. At the end of the sequence, the last peptide is generated from the last stored position until the end of the sequence.\n\nWhen a peptide is generated, several estimations are computed as explained in the following section.\n\n\nMolecular mass and isoelectric point estimations\n\nFor each generated peptide, three measurements are computed: the length of the peptide, its estimated molecular weight and its estimated isoelectric point (pI). The length is simply the number of amino acids composing the peptide.\n\nThe molecular mass of a peptide is less direct to compute. Since proteolysis requires a molecule of water, after a cleavage the chemical structure of the resulting peptide is slightly modified: a hydrogen is added at the N-terminus and a hydroxyl group is added at the C-terminus. The mass of two hydrogens and one oxygen must then be added to the total mass of the peptide. The resulting mass of a peptide is calculated by adding up the average isotopic masses of each amino acid present in the peptide and the average isotopic mass of one water molecule. Note that in RPG, no post-translational or digestion-induced modifications are included in the results.",

This plant has been used widely to prepare numerous kinds of food and beverages in many countries due to its beneficial functional properties. Active compounds that contribute to its antimicrobial properties are madecassic acid, asiatic acid, madecassoside, and asiaticoside. C. asiatica extract can inhibit majorities of foodborne pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms. It also contained antioxidant properties and has been proven to have an insignificant toxicity effect on human consumption. Currently, there is an increase of interest in research development for natural antioxidants and antimicrobial agents to replace the synthetic types in the food industry. This review presents information on the antioxidant capabilities of C. asiatica and its function to inhibit, reduce or minimize microbial growth. The toxicity and safety aspects of consuming C. asiatica extract has also been highlighted to provide essential data for the development of natural preservatives.\n\nINTRODUCTION",

The general process is illustrated in Figure 3. Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed. The oligosaccharide can then be functionalized for further study.",

The chainmaker routine ( Figure 2A) creates an HS chain of specified length and composition with disaccharides situated in positions that satisfy known rules of biosynthesis. In step 1 of the routine, a base chain is generated containing N units of unmodified disaccharide (G0A0) (see definition of nomenclature in Materials and Methods). The actual disaccharides in the chain are calculated from the total disaccharide composition, and these disaccharides (except for G0A0) are placed into a selection pool. A disaccharide is randomly selected from the pool, and a position on the chain is randomly chosen (step 2). If G0A0 exists in the selected chain position and Nunsubstituted glucosamine is not on the upstream side (farther from the tetrasaccharide-protein linkage), the selected disaccharide replaces G0A0. If N-unsubstituted glucosamine is on the upstream side of the position, the selected disaccharide must contain glucuronic acid in order to replace G0A0. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, another position is randomly chosen for the disaccharide until a successful replacement occurs.",

Molecules with desired properties are then chosen after screening a possible set of candidate molecules by this prediction model. 5 The candidate molecules for screening need to be manually obtained from such sources as combinatorial enumerations of possible fragments [6][7][8] and public databases. 9,10 It is necessary to secure a sufficient amount of molecules that are properly labeled with properties, as prediction accuracy typically depends on the number of labeled molecules and the quality of the labels.",

The antagonists against 5-HT3 receptors effectively inhibit the chemotherapy-induced emesis in humans (1) and ferrets (2). Cisplatin-induced emesis can also be abolished by a combination of vagotomy and greater splanchnicectomy in dogs (3), and the treatment with cisplatin increases the level of 5-HT in dog ileum (4). These observations suggest that 5-HT released from en terochromaffin cells binds to 5-HT3 receptors located on the end of the afferent vagus and the greater splanchnic nerve, and the 5-HT initiates sensory signals to finally stimulate the vomiting center (1,5). Therefore, 5-HT3 receptors existing in the gastrointestinal organ is widely considered as the site of action of 5-HT3-receptor antago nists in preventing the chemotherapy-induced emesis. Azasetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist (6 8), inhibits the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in animals (9, 10) and humans (11). The affinity of azasetron for the 5-HT3 receptor examined in the cerebral cortex of rats indicated that the agent binds to the receptor competitively with [3H]granisetron with a K; value of 0.54 nM (12). However, the gastro intestinal organ would be the very site of action of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and the affinity should be evaluated in such an organ.

Among them, 5-HT3 recep tors are widely distributed in the enteric nervous system (5) and play important roles in the regulation of gastro intestinal motility (2, [6][7][8]. In fact, the potent and highly selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron (GR 38032F) accerelates gastric emptying (9,10) and inhibits cisplatin-induced emesis in animals and humans (10)(11)(12)(13)(14).

Nux vomica has shown analgesic, antirheumatic, anticancer, and other medicinal benefits in pharmacological trials [2,10].However, limitations such as a restricted therapeutic window, a short half-life, and high toxicity limit its practical use.Nux vomica contains around 1.5-5% alkaloids, of which STCN accounts for approximately 70% [11].",

Phytoconstituents obtained from natural sources have been gaining importance in the day by day because of the vast chemical diversity. Demands of herbal medicines have been increased in the last two decades, so there is need to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of herbal drugs [21][22][23] . Phytochemical standardization is one of the tools for the quality assessment, which includes preliminary phytochemical screening, HPTLC fingerprint analysis and Quantitative analysis of marker compound using modern analytical techniques. In the last few decades (HPTLC) has become known as an important tool for the qualitative semi-quantitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis of herbal drugs and formulations. The major advantage of HPTLC is that several samples can be analyzed simultaneously using a small quantity of marker compound and mobile phase with very less time [24] . The linear regression curve showed a good linear relationship for strychnine and brucine. Standard strychnine and brucine showed single peak in HPTLC chromatogram. After development the plate was scanned at 254 nm. The calibration curve was prepared by plotting the concentration of strychnine and brucine versus average area of the peak. The amount of strychnine and brucine were quantified using calibration curve.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nBy this method we can interpretate that the Strychnos nux-vomica contained considerable amount of Flavonoids, strychnine and brucine. This analytical method can be utilizes for the simultaneous estimation of strychnine and brucine in the Strychnos nux-vomica. In future this study this study will be helpful for the quantitative determination of phytoconstituents in Strychnos nux-vomica.",

They are responsinle for different color, flavor and smell of plants. They form part of a plant's natural defense mechanism against diseases. Their therapeutic values to human health have been reported in the different system of medicine [1] . Natural products such as pure phytoconstituents and plant extracts offer limitless opportunities for new drug development due to the unmatched availability of chemical diversity. Plants play an important role in the medicinal preparations, both preventive and curative. In the world, China and India are the leading countries in using medicinal plants and their traditions of plant remedies date back to at least 7000 years. According to WHO 80% of the World's population relies on traditional medicine to meet their daily health requirement. Today the vast traditional knowledge of medicinal plants is playing an important role in the development of new drugs. Some of the important drugs which were developed from plants source are aspirin from filipendula ulmar, morphine from papaver sominiferum and ephedrin from ephedra [2] . A large number of phyto drugs prescribed worldwide are derived directly or indirectly from natural sources. A number of plant based drug is included in the WHO's essential medicine list [3] .\n\nStrychnos nux-vomica is an evergreen tree native to South East Asia and India belonging to family Loganiaceae.

In fact, ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs along with many other DNA damaging reagents are expected to cause cell cycle arrest by various cell cycle checkpoints as a normal outcome in both normal and tumor cells [2]. Cell cycle checkpoints will temporarily stop the progression of cell cycle, to allow time for the repair of the DNA damage in order to maintain the genomic integrity and the survival of the cells. From a therapeutic point of view, Chk1-mediated S or G2 checkpoint arrests in tumor cells will limit the efficacy of radiation therapy and cyctotoxic drugs leading to drug resistance. On the other hand, it has been suggested that Chk1 inhibition would preferentially sensitize tumors to DNA damaging agents , where 50% of the tumor cells are stated to be deficient in the protein P53 that causes DNA-damage-induced G1 arrest, but has minor role on the S or G2 checkpoints [3,4]. Cells depend normally on arrest at G1 phase for repair of DNA damage, while p53-mutated tumor cells depend on the cell cycle arrest and consequent DNA damage repair by S and G2 checkpoints action due to their incapability of G1 arrest. As a result, specific inhibition of S and G2 arrests through inhibition of Chk1 is expected to selectively drive p53-deficient tumor cells to enter mitotic catastrophe and finally apoptosis following DNA damage [5,6]. This assumption has been confirmed recently by the reported increase in effectiveness of DNA-damaging agents when given to p53-mutated tumor cells after knocking down their Chk1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Chk1 antisense technique [7][8][9] , or even if inhibited by a natural product such as 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) [10,11], which proves Chk1 to be a target for selective chemosensitization. The continued interest in designing new Chk1 inhibitors prompted us to explore the possibility of developing ligand-based three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore(s) integrated within self-consistent QSAR model. This approach avoids the pitfalls of structure-based techniques; furthermore, the pharmacophore model(s) can be used as 3D search queries",

More importantly, we showed that this activation results in insulin-like activity in a cell-based system. In a remarkable coincidence, the selected molecule is a TCM that has been shown to lower blood glucose in murine diabetes models (Chen et al., 2013;Nie et al., 2010Nie et al., , 2016. These findings should encourage attempts to develop a small molecule replacement for insulin.

Deduced amino acid sequences of RCA1, RCA2, and RCA3 have agreement with average molecular masses from electrospray mass spectrometry of 4537, 4543, and 4532 kDa, respectively. The only sites for serine phosphorylation are near or at the C terminal and hence adjacent to the sites of proteolytic precursor cleavage[15].Cysteine-rich peptides (Rs-AFP1 and Rs-AFP2) isolated from R. sativus showed peptides 6, 7, 8, and 9 comprising the region from cysteine 27 to cysteine 47[16]. Protein AFP1 isolated from radish showed peptide fragments (6-mer, 9-mer, 12-mer, and 15-mer)[17].Proteins RAP-1 and RAP-2 were isolated from Korean radish seeds. The molecular mass of the two purified was established to be 6.1 kDa (RAP-1) and 6.2 kDa (RAP-2) by SDS-PAGE and 5.8 kDa (RAP-1) and 6.2kDa (RP-2) by gel filtration chromatography[17].",
