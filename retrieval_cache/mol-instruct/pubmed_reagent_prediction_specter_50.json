Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Our strategy of carrying out research is to investigate three to four different topics at a time so we can gather as many results as possible. These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

When I think of Tetsuo Nozoe, these are the images that immediately come to mind. When I think of the Nozoe Autograph Books, I also think of time. For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

However, the role of Lawesson's reagent in synthesis has changed drastically, and now its use can help the chemistry community to understand innovative ideas. These include constructing biologically valuable heterocycles, coupling reactions, and the thionation of natural compounds. The ease of availability and the convenient usage of LR as a thionating agent made us compile a review on the new diverse applications on some common functional groups, such as ketones, esters, amides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, with biological applications. Since the applications of LR are now diverse, we have also included some new classes of heterocycles such as thiazepines, phosphine sulfides, thiophenes, and organothiophosphorus compounds.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with <iNSR</i the interesting field of C-H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.",

Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

An attempt has been made, whenever possible, to describe the enzymatic mechanisms of catalysis within the context of their synthetic counterparts and to discuss the mechanistic hypotheses for those reactions that are currently active areas of investigation. This Review has been categorized by reaction type, for example condensation, nucleophilic addition, reduction and oxidation, substitution, carboxylation, radical-mediated, and rearrangements, which are subdivided by name reactions.",

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol.

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For years, the goal was to develop catalysts that were highly selective for a single transformation. However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence. This Minireview focuses on methods in which the mechanisms of the transformations are fundamentally very different.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For years, the goal was to develop catalysts that were highly selective for a single transformation. However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence. This Minireview focuses on methods in which the mechanisms of the transformations are fundamentally very different.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Among the MCRs, those with isocyanides have developed into popular organic-chemical reactions in the pharmaceutical industry for the preparation of compound libraries of low-molecular druglike compounds. With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products. MCRs and especially MCRs with isocyanides offer many opportunities to attain new reactions and basic structures. However, this requires that the chemist learns the \"language\" of MCRs, something that this review wishes to stimulate.",

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides are condensation polymers of small subunits stitched together by carbon-heteroatom bonds. Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call \"click chemistry\". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect \"spring-loaded\" reactions. The stringent criteria for a process to earn click chemistry status are described along with examples of the molecular frameworks that are easily made using this spartan, but powerful, synthetic strategy.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

The latest discoveries are placed within a historical context, but the main thrust is to highlight the new catalytic possibilities that gold-catalyzed reactions currently offer the synthetic chemist, in particular in redox reactions and nucleophilic additions to pi systems. Indeed gold has proved to be an effective catalyst for many reactions for which a catalyst had not been previously identified, and many new discoveries are still expected.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Most notably, RMG can now generate heterogeneous catalysis models in addition to the previously available gas- and liquid-phase capabilities. For model analysis, new methods for local and global uncertainty analysis have been implemented to supplement first-order sensitivity analysis. The RMG database of thermochemical and kinetic parameters has been significantly expanded to cover more types of chemistry. The present release includes parallelization for faster model generation and a new molecule isomorphism approach to improve computational performance. RMG has also been updated to use Python 3, ensuring compatibility with the latest cheminformatics and machine learning packages.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products. MCRs and especially MCRs with isocyanides offer many opportunities to attain new reactions and basic structures. However, this requires that the chemist learns the \"language\" of MCRs, something that this review wishes to stimulate.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with <iNSR</i the interesting field of C-H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.",

We discuss in this Review various aspects of chemoselectivity that have been addressed in a range of synthetic methods over the past decade. We have focused on the proposed mechanistic basis of the reactions under consideration in an attempt to categorize them and highlight the key concepts that have been emerging on the basis of these studies.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

This tutorial review aims to critically describe the developments achieved in recent years, charting the ideas, challenges, and milestone reactions that were essential for the progress of this field.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

However, the role of Lawesson's reagent in synthesis has changed drastically, and now its use can help the chemistry community to understand innovative ideas. These include constructing biologically valuable heterocycles, coupling reactions, and the thionation of natural compounds. The ease of availability and the convenient usage of LR as a thionating agent made us compile a review on the new diverse applications on some common functional groups, such as ketones, esters, amides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, with biological applications. Since the applications of LR are now diverse, we have also included some new classes of heterocycles such as thiazepines, phosphine sulfides, thiophenes, and organothiophosphorus compounds. Thionation of some biologically essential steroids and terpenoids has also been compiled.

With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products. MCRs and especially MCRs with isocyanides offer many opportunities to attain new reactions and basic structures. However, this requires that the chemist learns the \"language\" of MCRs, something that this review wishes to stimulate.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call \"click chemistry\". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect \"spring-loaded\" reactions.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

Its main functions were rounded for the thionation of various carbonyl groups in the early days, with exemplary results. However, the role of Lawesson's reagent in synthesis has changed drastically, and now its use can help the chemistry community to understand innovative ideas. These include constructing biologically valuable heterocycles, coupling reactions, and the thionation of natural compounds. The ease of availability and the convenient usage of LR as a thionating agent made us compile a review on the new diverse applications on some common functional groups, such as ketones, esters, amides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, with biological applications. Since the applications of LR are now diverse, we have also included some new classes of heterocycles such as thiazepines, phosphine sulfides, thiophenes, and organothiophosphorus compounds. Thionation of some biologically essential steroids and terpenoids has also been compiled. This review discusses the recent insights into and synthetic applications of this famous reagent from 2009 to January 2021.",

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

In many regards, the inherent beauty associated with a synthetic sequence can be linked to a certain combination of the creativity with which a sequence is designed and the overall efficiency with which the ultimate process is performed. In synthesis, as in other endeavors, beauty is very much in the eyes of the beholder. It is with this in mind that we will attempt to review an area of synthesis that has fascinated us and that we find extraordinarily beautiful, namely the combination of catalysis and sigmatropic rearrangements in consecutive and cascade sequences.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide-ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.",

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory.

Since the first introduction of the energy span model, we started to believe that indeed there is. Herein we will evaluate from mathematical, physical and applied perspectives the advantages in using the energy representation for the depiction of the kinetics of catalysis, compared to the usual rate constant representation. We will discuss many concepts such as the energy span, the determining states, the determining zone, graph theory, affinity, degrees of rate control, robustness and volcano plots. Special emphasis will be put on the effect of reactants' and products' concentrations, and how to easily and accurately understand their influence on the kinetics. Ultimately, we will try to explore if energy truly is the measure of all things.",

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

The utility of this reaction stems from the fact that it is generally highly stereoselective and occurs with inversion of the stereochemical configuration of the alcohol starting material. Furthermore, as carboxylic acids, phenols, imides, sulfonamides, and other compounds can be used as the acid/pronucleophile, this reaction is useful for the preparation of a wide variety of functional groups.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

However, its applicability to large-scale synthesis is undermined by the fact that alcohol activation occurs at the expense of two stoichiometric reagents - a phosphine and an azodicarboxylate. The ideal Mitsunobu reaction would be sub-stoichiometric in the phosphine and azodicarboxylate species and employ innocuous terminal oxidants and reductants to achieve recycling. This Review article provides a summary and analysis of recent advances towards the development of such catalytic Mitsunobu reactions.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Although Angewandte Chemie was originally founded as a journal for applied (\"angewandte\")--technical and analytical--chemistry, numerous review articles and abstracts published even in its first 50 years enable the milestones in chemical research in a much broader sense to be traced nicely. With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Since then, carbonylation chemistry by using carbon monoxide has occupied a central position in organometallic chemistry, as it relates to organic synthesis. There is, however, the problem of using gaseous carbon monoxide (a toxic greenhouse gas) in this chemistry. Recently, some strategies that address this issue have appeared.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Our strategy of carrying out research is to investigate three to four different topics at a time so we can gather as many results as possible. These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

This can be ascribed to the fact that this transformation has not been adequately reviewed in the classic books of named reactions in organic chemistry. Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Nucleic acids, proteins, and polysaccharides are condensation polymers of small subunits stitched together by carbon-heteroatom bonds. Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call \"click chemistry\". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect \"spring-loaded\" reactions. The stringent criteria for a process to earn click chemistry status are described along with examples of the molecular frameworks that are easily made using this spartan, but powerful, synthetic strategy.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Although Angewandte Chemie was originally founded as a journal for applied (\"angewandte\")--technical and analytical--chemistry, numerous review articles and abstracts published even in its first 50 years enable the milestones in chemical research in a much broader sense to be traced nicely. With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

Any competent chemist easily identifies the reaction named after Wittig, or Grignard, Diels-Alder, or Friedel-Crafts, Michael, or Favorsky. But how much do we can say about scientist who discovered it? This Essay is devoted to the transition-metal-catalyzed hydration of acetylenic hydrocarbons discovered by Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov. This reaction is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of carbonyl compounds. With it, in industry for a long time acetaldehyde was essentially manufactured from accessible unsaturated raw material-acetylene. This reaction is one of the first steps in the establishment of homogenous metal complex catalysis in organic synthesis. Herein, we described the history of this discovery and the role of many scientists in the development of research in this field. We would also like to show the life of Russian scientists in the latter half of the 19th century.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

These reactions were subsequently christened according to their inventors' name and so entered into the organic chemistry portfolio of \"named organic reactions\". As these discoveries were being conceived, massive social, political and geographical changes in these chemists' homeland were also occurring. In this review, a brief survey of known (and some lesser known) named organic reactions discovered by Italian chemists, along with their historical contextualization, is presented. ",

This timely Review traces back major achievements, discusses their mechanistic background, and highlights numerous applications to molecular synthesis.Iron-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions have matured to an indispensable class of reactions in organic synthesis. The advent of economically and ecologically attractive iron catalysts in the past years has stepped up the competition with the established palladium and nickel catalyst systems that have dominated the field for more than 30 years, but suffer from high costs, toxicity, and sometimes low reactivity. Iron-catalyzed protocols do not merely benefit from economic advantages but entertain a rich manifold of reactivity patterns and tolerate various functional groups. The past years have witnessed a rapid development with ever-more-efficient protocols for the cross-coupling between alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, and acyl moieties becoming available to organic chemists.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

An attempt has been made, whenever possible, to describe the enzymatic mechanisms of catalysis within the context of their synthetic counterparts and to discuss the mechanistic hypotheses for those reactions that are currently active areas of investigation. This Review has been categorized by reaction type, for example condensation, nucleophilic addition, reduction and oxidation, substitution, carboxylation, radical-mediated, and rearrangements, which are subdivided by name reactions.",

However, its applicability to large-scale synthesis is undermined by the fact that alcohol activation occurs at the expense of two stoichiometric reagents - a phosphine and an azodicarboxylate. The ideal Mitsunobu reaction would be sub-stoichiometric in the phosphine and azodicarboxylate species and employ innocuous terminal oxidants and reductants to achieve recycling. This Review article provides a summary and analysis of recent advances towards the development of such catalytic Mitsunobu reactions.",

For years, the goal was to develop catalysts that were highly selective for a single transformation. However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence. This Minireview focuses on methods in which the mechanisms of the transformations are fundamentally very different.",

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

However, having him listed among the authors of two name reactions, known as Norrish Type I and Type II, plus a subcase of the latter that is the Yang cyclization, is not coherent. Indeed, Norrish had no interest in organic synthesis, while this is a required feature of name reactions. And, at any rate, Professors Ciamician and Paternò had arrived at the same conclusions with the same compounds much earlier, except for the measurement of quantum yields. Things are too long away now for introducing any change, but one should remember that using Norrish name here is a mistake, while it would be appropriate to add the name of Ciamician for a different name reaction, the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of alkenes and conjugated carbonyls. In 1968, such an attribution was proposed by Professor Schömberg, but this had no effect and the present assignment has become a habit. The most important thing, however, is that the 2 + 2 reaction has become one of the most popular reactions in synthetic photochemistry.",

Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books. Our contributors range in age and experiences, from the youthful Tanzer to the more mature (including myself!) as do the signatories in the autograph books.

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

With the introduction of the International Edition in 1962, the author base, which had until then been primarily limited to German-speaking countries, became increasingly international, and the journal experienced impressive growth. Today, with its attractive layout, successful mix of articles, and high impact factor, Angewandte Chemie covers chemical research around the world in its full breadth, with its many achievements and future challenges.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call \"click chemistry\". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect \"spring-loaded\" reactions.

Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For years, the goal was to develop catalysts that were highly selective for a single transformation. However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence. This Minireview focuses on methods in which the mechanisms of the transformations are fundamentally very different.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.
