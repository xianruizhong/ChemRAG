Dimethyl fumarate is marketed under the brand name Tecfidera, and it was the third oral disease-modifying agent for multiple sclerosis approved by the FDA, following [fingolimod] and [teriflunomide]. Prior to its FDA approval, dimethyl fumarate had been used in Germany for treatment of psoriasis.']",

The goal of using of aprotinin was subsequently to minimize end-organ damage resulting from hypotension due to blood loss in surgery and to reduce the necessity for blood transfusions during surgery.

Upon subcutaneous administration of givosiran, the GalNAc moiety targets and binds with high affinity to asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) expressed on hepatocytes. Once inside the cell, the siRNAs bind to and silence ALAS1 mRNA and inhibit both the translation and expression of the ALAS1 protein. This prevents delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) formation, decreases 5-ALA levels and prevents the production of porphyrins and hemes, such as porphobilinogen (PBG). AHPs are a group of metabolic disorders caused by deficiencies of specific enzymes that are responsible for hemoglobulin biosynthesis within the liver, which leads to the accumulation of toxic intermediates, such as ALA and PBG. ALAS1, a liver-expressed, rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway, is responsible for the formation of ALA from succinyl-CoA and glycine. ESC enables the subcutaneous dosing of givosiran with increased efficacy, durability and a wide therapeutic index as compared to non-ESC GalNAc-siRNA conjugates.']",

On June 15, 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval and orphan drug designation to lurbinectedin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC who have experienced disease progression despite therapy with platinum-based agents. This accelerated approval is based on the rate and duration of therapeutic response observed in ongoing clinical trials and is contingent on the verification of these results in confirmatory trials.']",

This both decreases proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells. PI3K-delta plays a key role in the proliferation and survival of hematologic cancer cells. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells.

This both decreases proliferation and induces cell death in PI3K-delta-overexpressing tumor cells. PI3K-delta plays a key role in the proliferation and survival of hematologic cancer cells. The targeted inhibition of PI3K-delta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells.
