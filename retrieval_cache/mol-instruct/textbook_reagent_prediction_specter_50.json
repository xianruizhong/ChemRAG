Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures.

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

The reaction is favored when carried out with an unhindered substrate and a negatively charged nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, but is disfavored when carried out with a hindered substrate and a neutral nucleophile in a protic solvent. You might therefore expect the reaction of a tertiary substrate (hindered) with water (neutral, protic) to be among the slowest of substitution reactions. Remarkably, however, the opposite is true.

What would happen, though, if we were to carry out the reaction on a single enantiomer of a chiral reactant? For example, what stereochemical result would be obtained from addition of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to a chiral alkene, such as $(R)$-4-methyl-1-hexene? The product of the reaction, 4-methyl-2-hexanol, has two chirality centers and so has four possible stereoisomers.\n\n\nLet's think about the two chirality centers separately. What about the configuration at C4, the methyl-bearing carbon atom? Since C 4 has the $R$ configuration in the starting material and this chirality center is unaffected by the reaction, its configuration is unchanged. Thus, the configuration at C 4 in the product remains $R$ (assuming that the relative rankings of the four attached groups are not changed by the reaction).\n\nWhat about the configuration at C2, the newly formed chirality center? As shown in FIGURE 8.14, the stereochemistry at C 2 is established by reaction of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ with a carbocation intermediate in the usual manner. But this carbocation doesn't have a plane of symmetry; it is chiral because of the chirality center at C4. Because the carbocation is chiral and has no plane of symmetry, it doesn't react equally well from the top and bottom faces. One of the two faces is likely, for steric reasons, to be a bit more accessible than the other, leading to a mixture of $R$ and $S$ products in some ratio other than $50: 50$. Thus, two diastereomeric products, ( $2 R, 4 R$ )-4-methyl-2-hexanol and ( $2 S, 4 R$ )-4-methyl-2-hexanol, are formed in unequal amounts, and the mixture is optically active.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate. (a) A higher reactant energy level (red curve) corresponds to a faster reaction (smaller $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ). (b) A higher transition-state energy level (red curve) corresponds to a slower reaction (larger $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ).",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Rather than explain pericyclic reactions now, though, we'll look at them more carefully in Chapter 30.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid.

Many organic reactions occur in several steps, one of which usually has a higher-energy transition state than the others and is therefore slower. We call this step with the highest transition-state energy the rate-limiting step, or rate-determining step. No reaction can proceed faster than its rate-limiting step, which acts as a kind of traffic jam, or bottleneck. In the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction of $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{CBr}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, the fact that the nucleophile concentration does not appear in the firstorder rate equation means that it is not involved in the rate-limiting step and must therefore be involved in some other, non-rate-limiting step.

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition. Aldehydes and ketones have no such leaving group and thus do not usually undergo this reaction.\n\nThe Cannizzaro reaction takes place by nucleophilic addition of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to an aldehyde to give a tetrahedral intermediate, which expels hydride ion as a leaving group and is thereby oxidized. A second aldehyde molecule accepts the hydride ion in another nucleophilic addition step and is thereby reduced.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate. (a) A higher reactant energy level (red curve) corresponds to a faster reaction (smaller $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ). (b) A higher transition-state energy level (red curve) corresponds to a slower reaction (larger $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ).",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate. (a) A higher reactant energy level (red curve) corresponds to a faster reaction (smaller $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ). (b) A higher transition-state energy level (red curve) corresponds to a slower reaction (larger $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ).",

Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol. Chirality centers are marked by asterisks, and the bonds broken in each reaction are indicated by red wavy lines. The inversion of chirality occurs in step 2, where acetate ion substitutes for tosylate ion.",

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid.

The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Each reactant amount is used to separately calculate the amount of product that would be formed per the reaction's stoichiometry.

For the example in the previous paragraph, complete reaction of the hydrogen would yield\n\n$$\n\\text { mol } \\mathrm{HCl} \\text { produced }=3 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\times \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}}{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2}}=6 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}\n$$\n\nComplete reaction of the provided chlorine would produce\n\n$$\n\\text { mol } \\mathrm{HCl} \\text { produced }=2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \\times \\frac{2 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}}{1 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}}=4 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{HCl}\n$$\n\nThe chlorine will be completely consumed once 4 moles of HCl have been produced. Since enough hydrogen was provided to yield 6 moles of HCl , there will be unreacted hydrogen remaining once this reaction is complete. Chlorine, therefore, is the limiting reactant and hydrogen is the excess reactant (Figure 7.14).\n\n\nFIGURE 7.14 When $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ are combined in nonstoichiometric amounts, one of these reactants will limit the amount of HCl that can be produced.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

The reaction is favored when carried out with an unhindered substrate and a negatively charged nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, but is disfavored when carried out with a hindered substrate and a neutral nucleophile in a protic solvent. You might therefore expect the reaction of a tertiary substrate (hindered) with water (neutral, protic) to be among the slowest of substitution reactions. Remarkably, however, the opposite is true. The reaction of the tertiary halide 2-bromo-2-methylpropane $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{CBr}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to give the alcohol 2-methyl-2-propanol is more than 1 million times faster than the corresponding reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ to give methanol.\n\n\nWhat's going on here? A nucleophilic substitution reaction is occurring-a hydroxyl group is replacing a halogen-yet the reactivity order seems backward. These reactions can't be taking place by the $S_{N} 2$ mechanism we've been discussing, so we must therefore conclude that they are occurring by an alternative substitution\nmechanism. This alternative mechanism is called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{1}$ reaction, for substitution, nucleophilic, unimolecular.\n\nIn contrast to the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction of $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{CBr}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ has a rate that depends only on the alkyl halide concentration and is independent of the $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ concentration. In other words, the process is a first-order reaction; the concentration of the nucleophile does not appear in the rate equation.",

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition. Aldehydes and ketones have no such leaving group and thus do not usually undergo this reaction.\n\nThe Cannizzaro reaction takes place by nucleophilic addition of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to an aldehyde to give a tetrahedral intermediate, which expels hydride ion as a leaving group and is thereby oxidized. A second aldehyde molecule accepts the hydride ion in another nucleophilic addition step and is thereby reduced.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate. (a) A higher reactant energy level (red curve) corresponds to a faster reaction (smaller $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ). (b) A higher transition-state energy level (red curve) corresponds to a slower reaction (larger $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The amount of product generated by a chemical reaction is its actual yield.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Limiting Reactant - \nAn alternative approach to identifying the limiting reactant involves comparing the amount of product expected for the complete reaction of each reactant.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden.

Thus, an understanding of their properties and reactions is fundamental to understanding biological chemistry. In this chapter, we've looked both at acids and at their close relatives, nitriles ( $\\mathrm{RC} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ).\n\nCarboxylic acids are named systematically by replacing the terminal -e of the corresponding alkane name with -oic acid. Like aldehydes and ketones, the carbonyl carbon atom is $s p^{2}$-hybridized; like alcohols, carboxylic acids are associated through hydrogen-bonding and therefore have high boiling points.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of carboxylic acids is their acidity. Although weaker than mineral acids such as HCl , carboxylic acids dissociate much more readily than alcohols because the resultant carboxylate ions are stabilized by resonance between two equivalent forms.\n\nMost carboxylic acids have $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ values near 5, but the exact $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ of a given acid depends on structure. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic (have a lower $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ) because their carboxylate ions are stabilized. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-donating groups are less acidic (have a higher $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ) because their carboxylate ions are destabilized. The extent of dissociation of a carboxylic acid in a buffered solution of a given pH can be calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. Inside living cells, where the physiological $\\mathrm{pH}=7.3$, carboxylic acids are entirely dissociated and exist as their carboxylate anions.",

Carboxylic acid derivatives are among the most widely occurring of all molecules, both in laboratory chemistry and in biological pathways. Thus, a study of them and their primary reaction-nucleophilic acyl substitution-is fundamental to understanding organic chemistry. We'll begin this chapter by first learning about carboxylic acid derivatives, and we'll then explore the chemistry of acyl substitution reactions.\n\nClosely related to the carboxylic acids and nitriles discussed in the previous chapter are the carboxylic acid\nderivatives, compounds in which an acyl group is bonded to an electronegative atom or substituent that can act as a leaving group in the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction that we saw briefly in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry:\n\n\nMany kinds of acid derivatives are known, but we'll be concerned primarily with four of the most common ones: acid halides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides. Acid halides and acid anhydrides are used only in the laboratory, while esters and amides are common in both laboratory and biological chemistry. In addition, carboxylic acid derivatives called thioesters and acyl phosphates are encountered primarily in biological chemistry.

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

Carboxylic acid derivatives are among the most widely occurring of all molecules, both in laboratory chemistry and in biological pathways. Thus, a study of them and their primary reaction-nucleophilic acyl substitution-is fundamental to understanding organic chemistry. We'll begin this chapter by first learning about carboxylic acid derivatives, and we'll then explore the chemistry of acyl substitution reactions.\n\nClosely related to the carboxylic acids and nitriles discussed in the previous chapter are the carboxylic acid\nderivatives, compounds in which an acyl group is bonded to an electronegative atom or substituent that can act as a leaving group in the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction that we saw briefly in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry:\n\n\nMany kinds of acid derivatives are known, but we'll be concerned primarily with four of the most common ones: acid halides, acid anhydrides, esters, and amides. Acid halides and acid anhydrides are used only in the laboratory, while esters and amides are common in both laboratory and biological chemistry. In addition, carboxylic acid derivatives called thioesters and acyl phosphates are encountered primarily in biological chemistry. Note the structural similarity between acid anhydrides and acyl phosphates.\n\n\n\nAcid halide ( $\\mathrm{X}=\\mathrm{Cl}, \\mathrm{Br}$ )\n\n\nAcid anhydride\n\n\nEster\n\n\nAmide\n\n\nThioester\n\n\nAcyl phosphate",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst. The catalyzed pathway involves a two-step mechanism (note the presence of two transition states) and an intermediate species (represented by the valley between the two transitions states).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

The overall rate of a reaction is determined by the rate of the slowest in its mechanism, called the rate-determining step. Unimolecular elementary reactions have first-order rate laws, while bimolecular elementary reactions have second-order rate laws.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile.

By comparing the rate laws derived from a reaction mechanism to that determined experimentally, the mechanism may be deemed either incorrect or plausible.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Many organic reactions occur in several steps, one of which usually has a higher-energy transition state than the others and is therefore slower. We call this step with the highest transition-state energy the rate-limiting step, or rate-determining step. No reaction can proceed faster than its rate-limiting step, which acts as a kind of traffic jam, or bottleneck. In the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction of $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{CBr}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$, the fact that the nucleophile concentration does not appear in the firstorder rate equation means that it is not involved in the rate-limiting step and must therefore be involved in some other, non-rate-limiting step. The mechanism shown in FIGURE 11.9 accounts for these observations.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid. Thus, cyanohydrin formation provides a method for transforming an aldehyde or ketone into a different functional group.\n\n\nPROBLEM Cyclohexanone forms a cyanohydrin in good yield but 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone does not. 19-9 Explain.",

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition.

Studies carried out in the early 1900s by Arthur Lapworth showed that cyanohydrin formation is reversible and base-catalyzed. Reaction occurs slowly when pure HCN is used but rapidly when a small amount of base is added to generate the nucleophilic cyanide ion, $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$. Addition of $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$takes place by a typical nucleophilic addition pathway, yielding a tetrahedral intermediate that is protonated by HCN to give cyanohydrin product plus regenerated $\\mathrm{CN}^{-}$.\n\n\nCyanohydrin formation is somewhat unusual because it is one of the few examples of the addition of a protic acid ( $\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{Y}$ ) to a carbonyl group. As noted in the previous section, protic acids such as $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{HBr}, \\mathrm{HCl}$, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ don't normally yield carbonyl addition products because the equilibrium constants are unfavorable. With HCN, however, equilibrium favors the cyanohydrin adduct.\n\nCyanohydrin formation is useful because of the further chemistry that can be carried out on the product. For example, a nitrile ( $\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{C} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ) can be reduced with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to yield a primary amine $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right)$ and can be hydrolyzed by hot aqueous acid to yield a carboxylic acid.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

We'll look both at acids and at their close relatives, nitriles ( $\\mathrm{RC} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ), in this chapter and at carboxylic acid derivatives in the next chapter.\n\nCarboxylic acids, $\\mathbf{R C O}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\mathbf{H}$, occupy a central place among carbonyl compounds. Not only are they valuable in themselves, they also serve as starting materials for preparing numerous carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides, esters, amides, and thioesters. In addition, carboxylic acids are present in the majority of biological pathways.\n\nAn acid chloride $\\quad$ An ester",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E.

Answer: - \n$K_{c}=4.3$\n\nBy its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large $K$ will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small $K$ indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It's important to keep in mind that the magnitude of $K$ does not indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.\n\nThe equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing $Q$ to $K$ for\nan equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur. To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CO}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(g) \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{CO}_{2}(g)+\\mathrm{H}_{2}(g) \\quad K_{c}=0.640 \\quad \\mathrm{~T}=800^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\nThe bar charts in Figure 13.6 represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction's equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.",

To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

The rate law is:\n\n$$\n\\text { rate }=k\\left[\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right]^{2}[\\mathrm{CO}]^{0}=k\\left[\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right]^{2}\n$$\n\nRemember that a number raised to the zero power is equal to 1 , thus $[\\mathrm{CO}]^{0}=1$, which is why the CO concentration term may be omitted from the rate law: the rate of reaction is solely dependent on the concentration of $\\mathrm{NO}_{2}$. A later chapter section on reaction mechanisms will explain how a reactant's concentration can have no effect on a reaction rate despite being involved in the reaction.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Many organic reactions occur in several steps, one of which usually has a higher-energy transition state than the others and is therefore slower.

For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst. The catalyzed pathway involves a two-step mechanism (note the presence of two transition states) and an intermediate species (represented by the valley between the two transitions states).",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",
