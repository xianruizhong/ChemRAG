The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule.

From the equations 4, 5, 6 the electronegativity, chemical hardness and chemical softness as calculated are 18.82, 1.74 and 0.58 eV respectively. Electron affinity is the energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom. Ionization potential is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

For these reasons, in this part, we have to determine the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their properties like energy gap since they are used to provide information on the transfer of charges (Gatfaoui et al., 2019;. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are very important parameters for quantum chemistry . These orbitals allow determining the manner the molecule interacts with other species. LUMO, related with the ionization potential, can be thought the most frontiers orbital having free places for accepting electrons. On the other hand HOMO, related with the electron affinity of the molecule, represents the capability to donate electrons. Therefore, studying frontiers orbitals of molecules can provide important information to explore the mechanism of action and determine the active sites (Tahenti et al., 2020). Hence, the reactivity of the chloroquine derivatives is predicted by using the differences between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Those orbitals were determined via TD-DFT approach and the pictorial illustrations are given in Figs. 5 and S2. The green color corresponds to the negative phase, while the positive phase is represented by the red color. The distributions of these orbitals and energies are very useful indicators of reactivity . Concerning the hydroxychloroquine molecule, the energy level of the HOMO orbital is equal to \u00c05.553 eV and the energy level of the LUMO orbital E LUMO = \u00c01.052 eV (in gas phase). The energy separation value between HOMO and LUMO is called energy gap and it is found to be 4.500 eV (in ultimate value), while it is equal to 4.376 eV in water As everyone knows, the quantum chemical parameters of the molecule are very important for its practical application. Therefore, in this paper we calculated several quanta chemical reactivity using FMOs energies. Table 2 represents the calculated reactivity descriptors such as the energies of frontier molecular orbitals (E HOMO , E LUMO ), energy band gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, chemical softness, electronegativity, chemical potential, electrophilicity index and the maximum charge transfer index.

Clearly, lonchocarpol A, broussonol E, and diplacol demonstrated an intermolecular charge transfer as they excited from the ground state (S0) to the first excitation state. Interestingly, the LUMO energy is in the following order: lochocarpol A < dexamethasone < diplacol < broussonol E. The LUMO energy suggests that lonchocarpol A and dexamethasone are more susceptible to accepting electronic density because a lower energy molecular orbital will describe the additional electron.

The second and third row of Table I list -for each base of the corresponding column-the number of atoms participating in \u03c0-bonds and the total number of p z electrons in the molecule, respectively.

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity. As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV. Koopman's theorem is used to calculate molecular orbital energies, which allows closed-shell molecules to duplicate the molecule's reactivity. Based on the global reactivity characteristics, the molecule's calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronegativity are 5.65, 0.91, and 3.74 eV. The chemical hardness is also another important molecular property that explains the resistance of the atoms in the molecule to either polarize or deform their electron density clouds, the value is 2.83 eV.

These results are given in Table 3 and the representations are shown in Figure 3. The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev. In this case, the reaction site is located on the histamine unit (Table 1). So, the large gap obtained by PM3 implies high stability and low chemical reactivity of Cu(Hist)Cl 2 .

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory.

The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

Its energy is found to decrease in the order Me 4 \uf0bb Me 3 > OMe 4 \uf0bb OMe 1 > Me 5 which gives a crude estimate of the electron-donating ability of the different ligands. However, as shown below, there exists no simple correlation between the HOMO energy and the data from the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the metal\uf02dcarbon bond in the studied complexes.

Consequently, the carbon p\uf070 AOs appear at the HOMO and HOMO\uf02d1 with high coefficients, which also functions to decrease their energies.

In Figure 7 we plot the occupancies of the natural orbitals for the studied systems. We have designated the two orbitals with occupancies closest to 1 the highest occupied natural orbital HONO with occupancy greater than 1 and lowest unoccupied natural orbital LUNO with occupancy less than 1, respectively.\n\nThese natural orbitals together with usual highest occupied molecular orbital HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital LUMO are shown in Figure 7 The result shows that poly pyrrole is a single reference(dynamic correlation), closed shell system while other studied systems are multireference (static correlation), open shell in nature (see supplementary data).\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe geometric, thermodynamic, electronic properties and Absorption properties have been carried out carried out using Quantum mechanical calculation. Pyrrole and its derivatives have been studied using CCSD/6-311++G(d,p), STO-3G level of theory, TD-DFT and DFT B3LYP/6-31G (d) level of theory from monomer up to five repeating units\n\nThe mutual comparison of the obtained equilibrium geometries showed that the DFT predicted C-C and C=C bond length are in agreement with the experimental values. In order to characterize the alternation of single or double carbon-carbon bonds within the two ring moieties, the Bond Length Alternation parameter (BLA) was used.",

Extrapolating to infinite hydration numbers we find that these energies approach a value of -6 eV. This limiting one-electron energy is within a margin of +/-1 eV independent of the character of the ion and is 4 eV lower compared to the estimate obtained for the HOMO energy of the ions in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions. We argue that this discrepancy must the attributed to a shift in the reference of the one-electron potential of the periodic solvent model.",

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

Our results are also in agreement with the outcome of density functional theory calculations [81], where the \u03c0 HOMO wavefunction was found to be delocalized along adenine, with greater probabilities in atoms N7, N3, C6, C5, C8, and the lowest in atom N9, as well as with recent time-dependent density functional theory predictions [76], where the HOMO wavefunction is distributed all over the molecule except from atom N9.\n\nWe find the LUMO energy of adenine at \u22124.4 eV.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

Looking at the first \u03c0-\u03c0 * transition energy, our prediction of 4.2 eV underestimates the experimental results (4.6-4.7 eV [50,51,52,53,54,56,57]) by 0.4-0.5 eV. Calculated E \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 * values from several ab initio methods are between 4.9-5.3 eV [67,69,75,77], which overestimate the observed values by 0.2-0.7 eV. We mention that Refs. [67,69,75,77] attribute the HOMO-LUMO gap of thymine to a n-\u03c0 * transition. Fig. 2 (middle left) shows that the LUMO wavefunction of thymine exhibits its main amplitudes in atoms C6 and C4, with a total probability around 75%. All other atoms have less than 10% probability each, with vanishing amplitudes at the atoms C2 and O2. Our predictions agree with those from Ref. [76], where the LUMO wavefunction is mainly localized in atoms C4, C5, and C6.\n\n\nGuanine\n\nThe HOMO energy of guanine is \u22128.2 eV according to our results. Our prediction for its ionization energy almost coincides with the experimental observations (8.24 eV [45] and 8.28 eV [48]). Previous ab initio calculations have found the ionization energy of guanine at 8-8.3 eV [63], 7.75 eV [64], and 8.21 eV [65]. These values deviate from the experimental ones by 0-0.5 eV.\n\nWe observe in Fig. 3 (middle right) that the HOMO wavefunction of guanine is extended over a large part of the molecule, containing the atoms N2-C2-N3-C4-C5-N7-C8 (with total probability around 90%). The atoms N3 and C5 present the highest probabilities (around 20% each), while about 15% probability exists in atom C8.",

FMOs refer to the collective term of a molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap (i.e., the gap) between the HOMO and the LUMO reveals the charge transfer of electrons. The gap defines the first excited state, reflecting the dynamical stability and chemical reactivity of the molecule. Figure 11 shows the energy level diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C16, where the HOMO and LUMO are both distributed in the carboxyl and amido. The HOMO of the secondary orbitals is distributed in the carboxyl group, indicating the nucleophilic region, and the LUMO is located in the amido group, indicating the electrophilic region. Figure 12 shows the energy level diagrams of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C17, whose distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO on the functional groups is the same as that of 3C16. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C16 is 0.2858 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6803 eV. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C17 is 0.2855 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6966 eV.   Through the analysis of frontier molecular orbitals, we can obtain various molecular reactivity descriptors [51] to better understand the chemical properties of the title compounds, where molecular electronegativity (\u03c7) and chemical hardness (\u03b7) of the molecules were calculated using the formula, \u03c7 = (I + A)/2, and \u03b7 = (I \u2212 A)/2, where I is the ionization energy, which is a measure of the electron giving the ability of the molecules, and A is the electron affinity, which is a measure of the electron receiving ability of the molecules. In numerical terms, I = \u2212E HOMO , and A = \u2212E LUMO . Chemical potential (\u00b5) is opposite to molecular electronegativity in numerical value, i.e., \u00b5 =",

These results are given in Table 3 and the representations are shown in Figure 3. The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev. In this case, the reaction site is located on the histamine unit (Table 1). So, the large gap obtained by PM3 implies high stability and low chemical reactivity of Cu(Hist)Cl 2 .

S 1 presents an extended electron spatial distribution far from the nuclei due to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital, having a Rydberg character.Because of this particular electronic structure, the electron can be considered as effectively detached and some characteristics of excited Rydberg states converge to those of the related cation, in particular when describing the reactivity of the excited states (Lipsky 1981).To verify this assumption, we compared the computed relaxed geometries of neutral C 6 H 14 in the ground state S 0 , cation C 6 H 14 + in the ground state S 0 and neutral C 6 H 14 in the S 1 excited state (for simplicity, in the following we will refer to them as S 0 -neutral, S 0 -cation and S 1 -neutral, respectively).",

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule.

Our eigenphase plots, e.g. see figure 2, show that these resonances become systematically lower in energy as NV is increased in the SEP model and that for each isomer the lowest of the two resonances becomes bound. Shape resonances can be associated with occupation of lowlying molecular orbitals so we inspected the LUMOs (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) for each isomer. Qualitatively these do not depend on the target basis used; for each isomer the lowest LUMO is dominated by a p orbital localised on the Cl. For HOOCl the p orbital points approximately along the Cl-O bond, for HOClO it roughly points along the Cl-OH bond and for HClOO it can be thought of as being perpendicular to the approximate plane of the molecule. For HOOCl and HOClO the orbital appears to be anti-bonding while for HClOO it has a non-bonding orientation. For each isomer the second LUMO has its largest density on the H atom. For the isomers with an OH bond (HOClO and HOOCl) this accompanied by an anti-bonding arrangement along the OH bond; while for HClOO this LUMO also appears to be non-bonding.

The NBO analysis is significant to investigate the intra and inter molecular bonding, interaction among bonds, and charge distribution on the surface of CQD molecule. NBO provides molecular information such as population of Lewis and non-Lewis structure, the number of core (CR), two-centre bond (BD), three-centre bond (3C), long-pair NBO, non-Lewis (NL) with high occupancy, and Lewis (L) with low-occupancy orbital as shown in Table 5. In order to obtain the acceptable Lewis structure, the occupancy of orbitals should exceed the occupancy threshold.

While Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is related to ionization potential, and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, average energy values for HOMO and LUMO are connected to electronegativity (Prasad and Ojha, 2017). HOMO and LUMO of the molecule were plotted using the same level theory. These Frontier Molecular Orbitals  (FMOs) and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be seen in Fig. 10. While HOMO orbital is mainly localized on 3-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one molecule group, LUMO orbital is mainly localized on diethyl 2-(2-acetylhydrazono)malonate group. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is 3.6842 eV.\n\n\nDocking analysis against 7BQY",

On the other hand, the contribution of the five-membered ring to the frontier orbitals explains ( Figure  S4) the spectral differences with respect to C (Table S2). In particular, in \u03b5C \u03c0\u03c0*2 gets closer to \u03c0\u03c0*1, while its intensity decreases, leading to the disappearance of the large shoulder/ shallow maximum at 240\u2212250 nm present in the experimental spectrum of C (see Figure S1) and due to \u03c0\u03c0*2. The dark excited states are also affected by the imidazole moiety, since the lowest energy n\u03c0* state of C, involving the lone pair (LP) of N3, disappears. The lowest energy dark state (S 3 ) in \u03b5C, hereafter labeled as n\u03c0*, corresponds mainly to an excitation from the carbonyl lone pair toward a \u03c0* orbital (similar to the LUMO+1) and, as for C in water, is less stable than \u03c0\u03c0*2.",

Figure 3 shows their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and HOMO\u2212LUMO gap, which includes the frontier molecular orbitals of empty C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 for comparison. For empty C 66 H 4 , the HOMO level is \u22126.92 eV, while the LUMO level is \u22122.90 eV, and hence the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap equals to 4.02 eV. For empty C 70 Cl 6 , the corresponding values are \u22127.54, \u22123.30, and 4.24 eV, respectively. As presented in Figure 3, compared with C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 , the HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps of X@C 66 H 4 and X@ C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) are all declined. This result is mainly attributed to the introduction of additional Li and F energy levels, which thereby reduce the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap. The stability of thermally dynamically favored fullerene can also be judged with HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps. Generally, fullerenes with a smaller HOMO\u2212LUMO gap possess lower dynamic stability and higher reactivity. 34      Previous research studies have reported that the backdonation of charge indicates the covalent interactions between the inner atoms and the carbon cage. 35,36 Herein, we first performed localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis on X@ C 66 H 4 and X@C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) to study such interactions. As shown in Figure 4, the LOL function between Li atoms and carbon atoms is sparsely distributed, while a highly localized region occurs between F atoms and carbon atoms. This indicates that Li atoms and carbon atoms are mainly bound by electrostatic force and the covalent interaction is very weak, whereas F atoms interact strongly with carbon atoms through covalent bonds, consistent with the abovementioned NBO analysis.

FMOs refer to the collective term of a molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap (i.e., the gap) between the HOMO and the LUMO reveals the charge transfer of electrons. The gap defines the first excited state, reflecting the dynamical stability and chemical reactivity of the molecule. Figure 11 shows the energy level diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C16, where the HOMO and LUMO are both distributed in the carboxyl and amido. The HOMO of the secondary orbitals is distributed in the carboxyl group, indicating the nucleophilic region, and the LUMO is located in the amido group, indicating the electrophilic region. Figure 12 shows the energy level diagrams of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C17, whose distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO on the functional groups is the same as that of 3C16. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C16 is 0.2858 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6803 eV. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C17 is 0.2855 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6966 eV.

Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ).

Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV.

Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

The HOMO energy characterizes the ability to donate an electron and the LUMO energy characterizes the ability to obtain an electron, and the gap between HOMO and LUMO characterizes chemical stability of the molecule. The HOMO and LUMO energies for MMTZ have been calculated by the B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) method for the title compound and the calculation reveals that there were 30 occupied and 167 unoccupied molecular orbitals associated with MMTZ. The energy values were computed below HOMO energy = -5.952766 eV LUMO energy = -0.576882 eV HOMO-LUMO energy gap = 5.375884 eVConclusionThe Raman and FT-IR spectra of MMTZ were measured. The optimized molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of MMTZ were calculated using B3LYP /6-311++G (d, p) basis sets. The scaled vibrational frequencies calculated of this molecule were agreed quite well with the experimental frequencies. Potential energy distribution of each frequency was obtained using the program GAR2PED, and the overall recognition of the vibrational frequencies assignment were made.

Figure S7 illustrates the first 11 orbitals from both occupied (HOMO-10 to HOMO) and unoccupied (LUMO to LUMO+10) states. We note the difference between the highest and lowest HOMO levels is 155 meV for C3A3C3, 115 meV for C3T3C3, and 153 meV for G3A3G3. We find that C3A3C3 exhibits the highest HOMO energy difference between the representative structures. Furthermore, we also observe that C3A3C3 displays less variation in the energy of the HOMO levels in comparison to the other two sequences.\n\nFurthermore, we observe that HOMO levels are generally higher for C3T3C3 and G3A3G3: 70% of the C3T3C3 and G3A3G3 conformations have a HOMO level above -5 eV, while it is only 20% for C3A3C3. Moreover, although there are shifts in the orbital energy levels, the band gaps of all representative structures lie within the 3.8 -4.2 eV range ( Figure S8). This clearly indicates that while the content of each sequence is the same, energy levels differ due to conformational changes.\n\nLater, we analyze the spatial distribution of MO along the molecules. Figure S9 represents the first 4 occupied MOs from each representative structure. For all cases, occupied orbitals are either located on the rightmost or leftmost guanines. However, depending on the conformation, the localization of orbitals changes; for instance, while in C3A3C3 C1 (Cluster 1), the Please do not adjust margins Please do not adjust margins HOMO and HOMO-4 are delocalized on the same side, in C2 they are on the opposite guanines.

The ability of molecules with respect to electron donation or electron affinity can be determined using HOMO or LUMO energy values. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity. A high value of H-L implies high stability of molecules and lower reactivity in chemical reactions, while a low value of H-L implies low stability and higher molecular reactivity [22,33].",

Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability.

For these reasons, in this part, we have to determine the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their properties like energy gap since they are used to provide information on the transfer of charges (Gatfaoui et al., 2019;. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are very important parameters for quantum chemistry . These orbitals allow determining the manner the molecule interacts with other species. LUMO, related with the ionization potential, can be thought the most frontiers orbital having free places for accepting electrons. On the other hand HOMO, related with the electron affinity of the molecule, represents the capability to donate electrons. Therefore, studying frontiers orbitals of molecules can provide important information to explore the mechanism of action and determine the active sites (Tahenti et al., 2020). Hence, the reactivity of the chloroquine derivatives is predicted by using the differences between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Those orbitals were determined via TD-DFT approach and the pictorial illustrations are given in Figs. 5 and S2. The green color corresponds to the negative phase, while the positive phase is represented by the red color. The distributions of these orbitals and energies are very useful indicators of reactivity . Concerning the hydroxychloroquine molecule, the energy level of the HOMO orbital is equal to \u00c05.553 eV and the energy level of the LUMO orbital E LUMO = \u00c01.052 eV (in gas phase). The energy separation value between HOMO and LUMO is called energy gap and it is found to be 4.500 eV (in ultimate value), while it is equal to 4.376 eV in water As everyone knows, the quantum chemical parameters of the molecule are very important for its practical application. Therefore, in this paper we calculated several quanta chemical reactivity using FMOs energies. Table 2 represents the calculated reactivity descriptors such as the energies of frontier molecular orbitals (E HOMO , E LUMO ), energy band gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, chemical softness, electronegativity, chemical potential, electrophilicity index and the maximum charge transfer index.

The E LUMO and the E HOMO of the complex a are -0.0859 and -0.1651 eV, respectively, and the energy gap between E LUMO and E HOMO is equal to 0.0792 eV, that is, \u0394E=0.0792 eV.

From the above results, it can be shown that the stability of complex b is significantly higher than that of complex a. At the same time, the energy gap of complex a is lower than that of complex b. In summary, it can directly reflect that the stability of the complex formed by the ligand and Fe is better than that formed by the ligand and Zn. It means that the stability of the complex formed by Zn is stronger than that formed by Fe.

Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The calculation results indicate that the carbon and oxygen (in the ester group) come into being different large pi bonds with the benzene circles because of place blocking and conjugate effect. On this basis, the first excited state electronic transition energy was calculated by time-dependent density function theory. The calculated results show that the largest absorption spectra of the title compounds were obtained from the pi --&gt; pi* electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. And lambda(max) was obtained in 370-384 nm, belonging to the UV absorption area. The computed results show that the lateral substitutent of 1,4-bis [(p-methoxyphenoxy) carbonyl] has little effects on molecular structure. Because of place blocking, the dihedral angle between benzene (1) and benzene (2) augments 3 degrees-4 degrees. The introduction of the lateral substitutents has effects on vibrational spectra. The results showed that with the introduction of hydroxy the difference between E(HOMO) and E(LUMO) of the compound becomes small. While lambda(max) becomes large. Meanwhile, the difference between E(HOMO) and E(LUMO) reduces by 0.120 9 eV with the introduction of fluorin. This causes the biggest absorption wavelength to red shift 14 nm.",

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

For the HC(=O) radical this behaviour occurs because a secondary orbital interaction of the type pi*(C=O)&lt;--HOMO acts in conjunction with the primary SOMO&lt;--HOMO interaction to balance the SOMO--&gt;LUMO interaction. For the H2P(=O) radical, on the other hand, the much higher-lying LUMO (the sigma*P-O orbital) allows for only minimal secondary interaction, and this radical's ambiphilic behaviour is therefore reflective of a balance between SOMO--&gt;LUMO and SOMO&lt;--HOMO interactions.",

Therefore, the d to \u03c0 * transition is dominant in this region, and should be described as MLCT transition (Cole et al., 2002;Jaworska et al., 2007;Lodowski et al., 2009Lodowski et al., , 2011. The S 4 state has even less oscillator strength intensity compared to that of S 1 , in which both HOMO-3 and HOMO-4 contribute almost evenly to excitation at 2.58 eV. HOMO-3 derives from ribose, according to MO diagram, while HOMO-4 is composed from the Co d x 2 \u2212y 2 orbital. Coincidently, the S 5 involves the same set of orbitals which contribute to the S 4 state. The only difference, considering their specific characters, is that the S 5 state mixes a minor contribution from the HOMO-1\u2192 LUMO transition. However, the larger oscillator strength of the S 5 state makes it the strongest component of the \u03b1/\u03b2 band.",

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity. As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV. Koopman's theorem is used to calculate molecular orbital energies, which allows closed-shell molecules to duplicate the molecule's reactivity. Based on the global reactivity characteristics, the molecule's calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronegativity are 5.65, 0.91, and 3.74 eV. The chemical hardness is also another important molecular property that explains the resistance of the atoms in the molecule to either polarize or deform their electron density clouds, the value is 2.83 eV. Fig. 8 depicts the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, with blue and red color surface distributions indicating positive and negative locations in the molecular orbital wave function, respectively. The keto and methyl groups in the molecule have a high concentration of HOMO and LUMO.\n\n\nNonlinear optical properties (NLO)",

Because the electron is promoted from a bonding $\\pi$ molecular orbital to an antibonding $\\pi^{*}$ molecular orbital, we call this a $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ excitation (read as \"pi to pi star\"). The energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO of 1,3-butadiene is such that UV light of 217 nm wavelength is required to effect the $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ electronic transition (FIGURE 14.12).\n\n\nFIGURE 14.12 Ultraviolet excitation of 1,3-butadiene results in the promotion of an electron from $\\Psi_{2}$, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), to $\\Psi_{3}{ }^{*}$, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).\n\nAn ultraviolet spectrum is recorded by irradiating a sample with UV light of continuously changing wavelength. When the wavelength corresponds to the energy level required to excite an electron to a higher level, energy is absorbed. This absorption is detected and displayed on a chart that plots wavelength versus absorbance (A), defined as\n\n$$\nA=\\log \\frac{I_{0}}{I}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident light and $I$ is the intensity of the light transmitted through the sample.\nNote that UV spectra differ from IR spectra in how they are presented. For historical reasons, IR spectra are usually displayed so that the baseline corresponding to zero absorption runs across the top of the chart and a valley indicates an absorption, whereas UV spectra are displayed with the baseline at the bottom of the chart so that a peak indicates an absorption (FIGURE 14.13).\n\n\nThe amount of UV light absorbed is expressed as the sample's molar absorptivity ( $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ ), defined by the equation\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{A}{c \\times l}\n$$",

E HOMO is generally associated with the electron donating ability of a molecule. High values of E HOMO are likely to denote the tendency of the molecule to donate electrons to acceptor molecules of lower energy MO. E LUMO , indicates the ability of the molecule to accept electrons [34]. The binding ability of the molecule increases with increasing HOMO and decreasing LUMO energy values. Thus, the lower the value of E LUMO , the most probable it is that the molecule would accept electrons. Fig. 6 reveal the HOMO and LUMO of the cocrystal (DAPT:PTAA). From this results E HOMO and E LUMO value of the cocrystal is -5.6235 and -1.4171 respectively ( Table 3).\n\nThe difference between the HOMO and LUMO energy levels (DE) of the molecule is an important parameter determining the reactivity of the molecule. As DE decreases (especially for the cationic species), the reactivity of the molecule increases making the molecule less stable.

Extrapolating to infinite hydration numbers we find that these energies approach a value of -6 eV. This limiting one-electron energy is within a margin of +/-1 eV independent of the character of the ion and is 4 eV lower compared to the estimate obtained for the HOMO energy of the ions in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions. We argue that this discrepancy must the attributed to a shift in the reference of the one-electron potential of the periodic solvent model.",

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

Metal complexes with a small energy gap (\u00c1E) between the HOMO and LUMO values are more polarizable, thereby acting as soft molecules with a higher chemical reactivity. However, complexes with large energy gap offer greater stability and lower chemical reactivity than those with a small HOMO-LUMO energy gap. The DFT study revealed that the HOMO, HOMO-1, HOMO-2 and HOMO-3 energies are localized on the N1, N4, O2, O3, O6, O7, C8, C9, C35, C36 and C37 atoms of the amino acid ligand, partially localized on the Cd centre, namely dx 2 \u00c0 y 2 , as shown in Fig. 4 \n\n\nFigure 4\n\nHOMO and LUMO frontier molecular orbitals with respective molecular orbital number. delocalized over phenanthroline moiety.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

HOMO -LUMO energy\n\nThe fundamental importance of HOMO and LUMO understands the chemical stability and reactivity of many organic molecules. The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV.

In descending order, it has its main amplitude in atoms C5, C8, N3, N6, N7, C6, C2, C4, while the lowest probabilities exist in atoms N1 and N9. These results agree with those from Ref. [21], since in both cases the HOMO wavefunction is distributed all over adenine and the lowest probabilities are found at the same atoms. Our results are also in agreement with the outcome of density functional theory calculations [81], where the \u03c0 HOMO wavefunction was found to be delocalized along adenine, with greater probabilities in atoms N7, N3, C6, C5, C8, and the lowest in atom N9, as well as with recent time-dependent density functional theory predictions [76], where the HOMO wavefunction is distributed all over the molecule except from atom N9.\n\nWe find the LUMO energy of adenine at \u22124.4 eV.

It must be mentioned here that, although it is generally accepted for all DNA bases that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap corresponds to the first \u03c0-\u03c0 * transition [45,48,49,54,57], in Ref. [77] the HOMO-LUMO gap of adenine is attributed to a n\u03c0 * transition, while in Refs. [75,76] the \u03c0-\u03c0 * and n-\u03c0 * transitions are predicted to be very close.",

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

[42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The values of the energies E HOMO and E LUMO of these molecules, calculated are recorded in Table 4. E gap is a critical parameter for determining the electrical transport properties of a molecule. By using the values of the energies E HOMO and E LUMO for a molecule, the global descriptors of the chemical reactivity of the molecules such as the global hardness (M), the chemical potential ( c ), the flexibility (\u03b6), the electronegativity (\u2205), the ionization potential (IP), the electronic affinity (EA) and the electrophilicity index (\u03c9) were calculated using the mathematical formulas given earlier. These values are also recorded in Table 3. We observed that the gap energy ( E gap ) of these two molecules varies between 1 eV and 1.5 eV, these energies being less than 3 eV. The calculated parameters shows that these materials are good semiconductors which further confirms the results presented above, so these materials can have applications in electronics, optoelectronics and photonics. [43][44][45][46][47]. Concerning the frontier molecular orbitals of our molecules. The highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO respectively), are the most important parameters which permit us to know how the molecule interacts and explain the structure and reactivity of the molecules [35]. The HOMO which is nucleophilic or electron-donating, represent the capacity of a molecule to give an electron while LUMO which is electrophilic or electron-accepting, represent the capacity of a molecule to receive an electron. Figure 3 present the 3D molecular orbital diagrams. From this figure we can see that the halogen (chlorine and fluorine) atoms participates favorably in the charge-transfer to improve the electronic dynamism which reigns within these compounds.

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO in CMC are due to p-type orbitals localized to the Cu-N-C bonds. The difference on the frontier MOs may lead to a different redox reactivity.",

The difference in energy between these two frontier orbitals can be used to predict the strength and stability of transition metal complexes, as well as the colors they produce in solution. Semiconductors The HOMO level is to organic semiconductors roughly what the maximum valence band is to inorganic semiconductors and quantum dots. The same analogy can be made between the LUMO level and the conduction band minimum.

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

Its value is usually located between the fundamental gap (difference between ionization potential and electron affinity) and the optical gap. In addition, HOMO-LUMO gap can be related to a bulk material band gap or transport gap, which is usually much smaller than fundamental gap.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory.

The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

Further, the energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO, also known as the HOMO-LUMO gap, is a measure of the stability of a molecule and its ability to donate or accept electrons. In the context of biological activity, the energy gap is important because it determines how reactive a molecule is to other molecules and how easily it can participate in chemical reactions such as binding to proteins or enzymes [68] . A small energy gap indicates a more reactive molecule, while a large energy gap indicates a less reactive and more stable molecule.

Metal complexes with a small energy gap (\u00c1E) between the HOMO and LUMO values are more polarizable, thereby acting as soft molecules with a higher chemical reactivity. However, complexes with large energy gap offer greater stability and lower chemical reactivity than those with a small HOMO-LUMO energy gap.

Hence Frontier molecular orbitals were analysed through Density functional theroy (DFT) by using Gamess software with 6-31G (d,p) basic set at the B3LYP level [36,37]. The HOMO has the capacity to donate an electron whereas LUMO has the capacity to accept an electron. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO plays major role in describing the ability of a molecule to tranfer the charges. When the orbital energy gap between them is small, the molecule will be more reactive. The  calculated HOMO-LUMO gap of the molecule is 5.406eV, which shows that the molecule is less reactive and highly stable. The molecular orbital pictures of HOMO and LUMO are depicted in Figure 11. This shows HOMO is concentrated over the whole molecule, and LUMO is more concentrated over the amino phenyl ring. The FMO energies, the band gap energy (E gap ), and related global descriptive parameters are calculated and tabulated in Table 3.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe compound (c) was crystallized into an orthorhombic crystal system with the space group of Pca2 1 . The Hirshfeld surfaces and 2D fingerprint plots analysis provided the complete insight into cryatal packing and intermolecular interactions. The 3D intermolecular interaction energies between the molecular pair was studied, visualized, and analysed. Their result showed that in the crystal, electrostatic energy E ele was dominated over dispersion E dis energy. The in-silico analysis reveals that the title ligand (c) showed good binding energy with a hopeful active molecule for cancer treatment. Interaction energy of the ligand (c) with MMP -2 protein is (-7.48 kJ/mol) and it suggests that to be selective as an anti-cancer agent with further investigations.

This is in agreement with the experimental estimation of EgOPT, which indicated a larger band gap for PT2. It is worth to mention that our empirical and theoretical results also in agreement with a previous study using \ue103lms of poly (3-alkyl) thiophene, which showed that longer spacer chains generate larger band gaps. 54 Fig . 6b shows that the simulation in 1,4-dioxane does not generate an stabilization of the FMOs as it occurs in water, because the energy levels of the theoretical FMOs of both molecules decrease with the increase of monomer units, generating HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of \u00c02032 and \u00c01346 eV for the hexamers of OT1 and OT2 respectively.\n\nTo further analyze these differences, it is useful to plot directly the HOMO-LUMO energy gap values as a function of oligomer size.

In contrast, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is localized at one dppb moiety of the bridging diphosphine ligands. The nature of molecular orbitals of compound 1 at the S 1 minimum are almost constant except a little different weights from the different fragment groups (see the right panel of Fig. 4). The minimum-energy structures at both S 1 and T 1 states of 1 are similar to each other, thus subtly changes are found in the orbital analysis for the T 1 minimum compared with that for the S 1 one (see Fig. S2 \u2020). In addition, the calculations reveal that compositions for compound 2 at the S 0 and S 1 minima are almost identical with those of compound 1 and are thus placed in Fig. S3. \u2020 Since the photoexcited electron and the remaining hole are spatially separated in the p* orbital of the organic ligand and the 3d orbital of the Cu atom, the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO tends to be small enough to permit an inverse intersystem crossing process from the T 1 to S 1 states enabling TADF. At the S 0 minima, the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 4.07 and 3.97 eV for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. However, they decrease to 3.30 and 3.14 eV at the S 1 minima and 3.26 and 3.15 eV at the T 1 minima for compounds 1 and 2. Obviously, this remarkable reduction of the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps from the S 0 to S 1 minima of compounds 1 and 2 is responsible for the large Stokes shi\ue09d experimentally observed in the emission spectra (see below, Fig. 5). On the other hand, the energy gap becomes smaller in compound 2 than that of 1, which is caused by the introduction of the pyridyl N atom with large electronegativity to the aromatic ring that",

While Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is related to ionization potential, and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, average energy values for HOMO and LUMO are connected to electronegativity (Prasad and Ojha, 2017). HOMO and LUMO of the molecule were plotted using the same level theory. These Frontier Molecular Orbitals  (FMOs) and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be seen in Fig. 10.

The HOMO and LUMO energies for ligands and complexes provide information on the energy distribution and energy behavior. Negative EHOMO and ELUMO values are indicative of the stability of compounds [40]. The difference between energies of LUMO and HOMO orbitals, that is, the energy gap (ELUMO-EHOMO), is indicative of the chemical reactivity and kinetic stability of molecules [41,42]: a molecule with a wide HOMO-LUMO gap is identified as having high chemical hardness and good stability, and is much less polarizable. Molecules with a narrow HOMO-LUMO gap have good chemical reactivity and chemical softness and are more polarizable. That is, a wide HOMO-LUMO gap suggests a high molecular stability and low chemical reactivity [43]. The HOMO and LUMO energies reflect the ability to donate and receive an electron, respectively. A high HOMO energy is characteristic of a molecule more active in reactions with electrophiles, while a low LUMO energy corresponds to molecular reactions with nucleophiles [44]. A molecule with a narrow boundary orbital gap is highly polarizable and exhibits a significant degree of intramolecular charge transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and conjugation, which can affect the biological activity of a molecule [45].\n\nA three-dimensional view of HOMO-LUMO is presented in Figure 6.",

It is a popular quantum mechanical descriptor for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (Zhou and Parr, 1990). They play a significant role in governing a wide range of chemical interactions. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of the four monomers are evaluated and listed in Figure 2. The OCT compounds are alpha molecular orbital level (32) and alpha molecular orbital level (33), which depend on the HOMO-LUMO gap, respectively. The energy values of the HOMO (32) orbital and LUMO (33) orbital were laying at an energy value of -8.53 and -0.02 eV, respectively. The detailed data can be found in Supplementary Table S1. In comparing these HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of different compounds, the ABE shows the highest value of 201.25 kcal/mol. The higher HOMO-LUMO energy gap implies the kinetic energy is higher and has high chemical reactivity (Saranya et al., 2018). The result indicates that the allyl ether monomers are more highly reactive than the allyl analog.\n\nThe BDE of C-H bonds in the donors is the key to hydrogen transfer (Zhou et al., 2016). As can be seen from the data in Figure 3, we found that ACE and ABE monomers have the lower BDE value at 78.67 and 79.42 kcal/mol, indicating two C-H bonds are more easily broken than others. The difference between the allyl and allyl ether was about 5 kcal/mol,\n\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nValues for HOMO and LUMO of the OCT, ABE, CYC, and ACE at the M06-2X/6-311++g(d,p) level (Unit: kcal/mol).\n\n\nFIGURE 3",

The reactivity index (band gap) of the compounds with small difference implies high reactivity and a large difference implies low reactivity in reactions, therefore as the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO becomes smaller the rate of reaction is favoured. \u03b2-nicotyrine has the smallest HOMO-LUMO energy gap (4.811 eV) and therefore more reactive compared to nicotine (5.492 eV) and 3,5-dimethyl-1-phenylpyrazole (6.057 eV).

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms.

FMOs refer to the collective term of a molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap (i.e., the gap) between the HOMO and the LUMO reveals the charge transfer of electrons. The gap defines the first excited state, reflecting the dynamical stability and chemical reactivity of the molecule. Figure 11 shows the energy level diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C16, where the HOMO and LUMO are both distributed in the carboxyl and amido. The HOMO of the secondary orbitals is distributed in the carboxyl group, indicating the nucleophilic region, and the LUMO is located in the amido group, indicating the electrophilic region. Figure 12 shows the energy level diagrams of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C17, whose distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO on the functional groups is the same as that of 3C16. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C16 is 0.2858 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6803 eV. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C17 is 0.2855 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6966 eV.

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO in CMC are due to p-type orbitals localized to the Cu-N-C bonds. The difference on the frontier MOs may lead to a different redox reactivity.",

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

S 1 presents an extended electron spatial distribution far from the nuclei due to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital, having a Rydberg character.Because of this particular electronic structure, the electron can be considered as effectively detached and some characteristics of excited Rydberg states converge to those of the related cation, in particular when describing the reactivity of the excited states (Lipsky 1981).To verify this assumption, we compared the computed relaxed geometries of neutral C 6 H 14 in the ground state S 0 , cation C 6 H 14 + in the ground state S 0 and neutral C 6 H 14 in the S 1 excited state (for simplicity, in the following we will refer to them as S 0 -neutral, S 0 -cation and S 1 -neutral, respectively).",

While Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is related to ionization potential, and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, average energy values for HOMO and LUMO are connected to electronegativity (Prasad and Ojha, 2017). HOMO and LUMO of the molecule were plotted using the same level theory. These Frontier Molecular Orbitals  (FMOs) and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be seen in Fig. 10. While HOMO orbital is mainly localized on 3-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one molecule group, LUMO orbital is mainly localized on diethyl 2-(2-acetylhydrazono)malonate group.

These frontier molecular orbitals are known as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 4).  The electronic absorption relates to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and mainly described by one electron excitation from HOMO to LUMO [27]. Kinetic stability increases with the increase of the HOMO-LUMO gap. As a result, the removal of electrons from ground state HOMO to excited state LUMO requires more energy. Table 3 represents the values of orbital energies, along with the two global chemical descriptors, hardness, and softness, which are also calculated for all compounds. The highest softness was observed for the compound (9). Compound (9) also showed the lowest HOMO-LUMO gap (4.3552 eV) and hardness (2.1776eV), indicating the molecule is more reactive than other compounds, according to Hoque et al [28,29]. On the other hand, compound (3) showed the highest HOMO-LUMO gap (6.8730 eV) which less than our parent compound MGP (1) (7.5679 eV) which indicates that ester (3) closely stable as parent compound (1).

This is also used by the frontier electron density for predicting the most reactive position in \u03c0-electron systems and also explains several types of reaction in conjugated system [19]. The conjugated molecules are characterized by a small highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) separation. Both the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital are the main orbitals which take part in chemical stability. The HOMO represents the ability to donate an electron, LUMO as an electron acceptor, represents the ability to obtain an electron. The HOMO and LUMO energy calculated by B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method is shown below. This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.

From the previous studies it is known that for uranyl dication coordinated by ligands the lowest excited state arises from the \u03c3 u highest molecular orbital (HOMO) to the \u03b4 u lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO). The HOMO corresponds to the bonding combination of uranium 5f and 6p and oxygen 2p atomic orbitals, and 3p orbital of first-shell ligands, while the LUMO is a nonbonding uranium 5f orbital ( Figure 8). The detailed analysis of the atomic orbitals contributions performed with multi-reference CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent field) calculations by Pierloot and van Beisen [20] suggests that the lowestlying excitation corresponds to a metal-centered transition from the bonding to nonbonding orbital of uranium, with a marginal ligand-to-metal charge transfer character. Hence, we can use in our discussion the UO 2 2+ spinfree notations (D \u221eh ), thus labelling the ground state as 1 \u03a3 + g and the luminescent state as 3 \u2206 g . The vertical absorption E VA and emission E VE energies, were obtained at all-electron SOC CAM-B3LYP level of theory and are reported here together with experimental values (Table IV). They were computed with the summation of the fully relativistic electronic vertical energies associated with the spin-free zero-point energies correction. It should be noted that the experimental data correspond to the band-origin values obtained from polarized absorption or luminescence spectra and emission energies taken from UV-Visible spectroscopic measurements. Thus the direct comparison with theoretical re- sults is not relevant, but we rather discuss whether the theoretical data reproduce the experimental trends. As seen in Table IV, the vertical absorption energy of [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2increases by 85 cm \u22121 with the addition of acetone due to its small polarity. A blue shift of 117 cm \u22121 is observed when chlorides are replaced by bromides ligands. On the contrary, the band origins seem red shifted by 128 cm \u22121 , from chloride to bromide complexes according to experimental data",

The E LUMO and the E HOMO of the complex a are -0.0859 and -0.1651 eV, respectively, and the energy gap between E LUMO and E HOMO is equal to 0.0792 eV, that is, \u0394E=0.0792 eV. It shows that in order to generate an excited state, 0.0792 eV will be absorbed by the ground state molecules of complex a. However, the calculated E LUMO and the E HOMO of complex b are -0.0881 eV and -0.1948 eV, respectively, and the energy gap (\u0394E L\u2212H ) is 0.1067 eV. From the above results, it can be shown that the stability of complex b is significantly higher than that of complex a. At the same time, the energy gap of complex a is lower than that of complex b. In summary, it can directly reflect that the stability of the complex formed by the ligand and Fe is better than that formed by the ligand and Zn. It means that the stability of the complex formed by Zn is stronger than that formed by Fe. Therefore, if zinc atoms are used to replace the iron atoms in heme, the replaced complexes will have better stability.  \n\n\nConclusion",

Figure 3 shows their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and HOMO\u2212LUMO gap, which includes the frontier molecular orbitals of empty C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 for comparison. For empty C 66 H 4 , the HOMO level is \u22126.92 eV, while the LUMO level is \u22122.90 eV, and hence the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap equals to 4.02 eV. For empty C 70 Cl 6 , the corresponding values are \u22127.54, \u22123.30, and 4.24 eV, respectively. As presented in Figure 3, compared with C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 , the HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps of X@C 66 H 4 and X@ C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) are all declined. This result is mainly attributed to the introduction of additional Li and F energy levels, which thereby reduce the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap. The stability of thermally dynamically favored fullerene can also be judged with HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps. Generally, fullerenes with a smaller HOMO\u2212LUMO gap possess lower dynamic stability and higher reactivity. 34      Previous research studies have reported that the backdonation of charge indicates the covalent interactions between the inner atoms and the carbon cage. 35,36 Herein, we first performed localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis on X@ C 66 H 4 and X@C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) to study such interactions. As shown in Figure 4, the LOL function between Li atoms and carbon atoms is sparsely distributed, while a highly localized region occurs between F atoms and carbon atoms. This indicates that Li atoms and carbon atoms are mainly bound by electrostatic force and the covalent interaction is very weak, whereas F atoms interact strongly with carbon atoms through covalent bonds, consistent with the abovementioned NBO analysis.

Negative oxygen charges increase in the polar solvent, unlike nitrogen atoms, which become less negative. Only carbon atoms bonded to oxygen atoms have positive charges.\n\nMolecular orbitals (MOs), especially the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are of crucial importance for molecular reactivity. The two highest occupied MOs, i.e., HOMO and HOMO-1, of both compounds are located prevailingly at one of the phenyl rings and at neighboring heteroatoms (Figures 8 and S4). The LUMO of 4B8M is located in both phenyl rings and at its tetrapeptide ring whereas the LUMO of YEPVIZ is located at its tetrapeptide ring. The LUMO energies of both compounds are negative (Table S6) which indicates their high electronacceptor ability. Solvent effects shift the LUMO energies to less negative values. On the other hand, the energies of occupied MOs are more negative in polar solvents. Nevertheless, the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps increase in the solvent, which indicates their higher stability in aqueous solutions.    Table 1.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal.

To elucidate the substitution effect of the chlorine atom on the HOMO of pyridine, we obtained one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analysed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectra of 2-CP having 35Cl or 37Cl to analyse the isotope effect on the vibrational mode. Based on the 0-0 band in the MATI spectrum of 2-CP having 35Cl, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined to be 9.4743 \u00b1 0.0005 eV (76\u2009415 \u00b1 4 cm-1) with a similar value for 37Cl, which is much lower but more accurate than the vertical value of 9.63 eV determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the MATI spectrum, which was affected by the geometrical change with respect to the neutral geometry upon ionization, could be analysed by Franck-Condon fitting and spectral correlation between the two isotopomers. Notably, we observed the appearance of the out-of-plane ring bending modes resulting from ring distortion, unlike in pyridine. Furthermore, natural bond orbital analysis led to the conclusion that the warped structure with C1 symmetry of cationic 2-CP is induced by the electron removal from the HOMO consisting of the \u03c0 orbital in the pyridine ring, which is stabilized by hyperconjugation with the lone-pair p orbitals of a nitrogen and chlorine atom.",

In this study, we considered a number of radicals from smallest diatomic anion radicals such as superoxide anion radical to one-electron oxidized DNA related base radicals that show the SOMO is energetically lower than one or more doubly occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) (SOMO-HOMO level inversion). The electronic configurations are calculated employing the B3LYP/6-31++G** method, with the inclusion of aqueous phase via the integral equation formalism of the polarized continuum model solvation model. From the extensive study of the electronic configurations of radicals produced by one-electron oxidation or reduction of natural-DNA bases, bromine-, sulfur-, selenium-, and aza-substituted DNA bases, as well as 20 diatomic molecules, we highlight the following important findings: (i) SOMO-HOMO level inversion is a common phenomenon in radical species. (ii) The more localized spin density in \u03c3-orbital on a single atom (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or selenium), the greater the gap between HOMO and SOMO. (iii) In species with SOMO-HOMO level inversion, one-electron oxidation takes place from HOMO not from the SOMO, which produces a molecule in its triplet ground state. Oxidation of aqueous superoxide anion producing triplet molecular oxygen is one example of many. (iv) These results are for conventional radicals and in contrast with those reported for distonic radical anions in which SOMO-HOMO gaps are smaller for more localized radicals and the orbital inversions vanish in water. Our findings yield new insights into the properties of free radical systems.",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule.

These results are given in Table 3 and the representations are shown in Figure 3. The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev. In this case, the reaction site is located on the histamine unit (Table 1). So, the large gap obtained by PM3 implies high stability and low chemical reactivity of Cu(Hist)Cl 2 .

These frontier molecular orbitals are known as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 4).  The electronic absorption relates to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and mainly described by one electron excitation from HOMO to LUMO [27]. Kinetic stability increases with the increase of the HOMO-LUMO gap. As a result, the removal of electrons from ground state HOMO to excited state LUMO requires more energy. Table 3 represents the values of orbital energies, along with the two global chemical descriptors, hardness, and softness, which are also calculated for all compounds. The highest softness was observed for the compound (9). Compound (9) also showed the lowest HOMO-LUMO gap (4.3552 eV) and hardness (2.1776eV), indicating the molecule is more reactive than other compounds, according to Hoque et al [28,29].

To illustrate the causes of the increase of S vN with n, we plot the active orbital occupation numbers for the lowest singlet state of n-cyclacene as a function of the number of benzene rings, calculated using TAO-LDA. Here, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is the (N/2) th orbital, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is the (N/2 + 1) th orbital, where N is the number of electrons in n-cyclacene. For brevity, HOMO, HOMO \u2212 1, \u2026 , and HOMO \u2212 15, are denoted as H, H \u2212 1, \u2026 , and H \u2212 15, respectively, while LUMO, LUMO + 1, \u2026 , and LUMO + 15, are denoted as L, L + 1, \u2026 , and L + 15, respectively.\n\nAs presented in Fig. 9, the number of fractionally occupied orbitals increases with increasing cyclacene size, clearly indicating that the polyradical character of n-cyclacene indeed increases with the cyclacene size. Similar to the previously discussed properties, the active orbital occupation numbers of n-cyclacene also exhibit oscillatory behavior, showing wave-packet oscillations.  Real-Space Representation of Active Orbitals. For the lowest singlet states of some representative n-cyclacenes (n = 4-7), we explore the real-space representation of active orbitals (e.g., HOMOs and LUMOs), obtained with TAO-LDA. Similar to previous findings for n-acenes 47,49,50,56 , the HOMOs and LUMOs of n-cyclacenes are mainly localized at the peripheral carbon atoms (see Fig. 10).\n\n\nConclusions",

The excitation energies of the lowest singlet MLCT (metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer) states range between 12 630 and 17 580 cm(-)(1). They originate in the excitation of chromium d electrons to the lowest pi(bpy) orbital of b(2) local symmetry.

This result agrees very well with the experimental spectra recorded in weakly solvating C(2)Cl(4), characterized by a band at 17 700 cm(-)(1). The low-energy emission band at 12 850 cm(-)(1) has been attributed to the lowest a(3)B(2) state calculated at 12 560 cm(-)(1).

The singlet excited states corresponding to d --&gt; d excitations are calculated between 29 650 and 37 360 cm(-)(1).

With support from theoretical calculations using the spin-flip coupled-cluster methods, the ground electronic state of HCCCN is assigned as a triplet state, while the first excited state is a closed-shell singlet. The photoelectron band corresponding to the triplet is broad and congested, indicating a large geometry change between the anion and neutral. A single sharp feature of the singlet band suggests that the geometry of the excited neutral is similar to that of the anion. In agreement with these observations, theoretical calculations show that the neutral triplet state is either linear or quasilinear (X (3)B(1) or (3)Sigma(g) (-)), while the closed-shell singlet (a (1)A(1)) geometry is strongly bent, similar to the anion structure.

S 1 presents an extended electron spatial distribution far from the nuclei due to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital, having a Rydberg character.Because of this particular electronic structure, the electron can be considered as effectively detached and some characteristics of excited Rydberg states converge to those of the related cation, in particular when describing the reactivity of the excited states (Lipsky 1981).To verify this assumption, we compared the computed relaxed geometries of neutral C 6 H 14 in the ground state S 0 , cation C 6 H 14 + in the ground state S 0 and neutral C 6 H 14 in the S 1 excited state (for simplicity, in the following we will refer to them as S 0 -neutral, S 0 -cation and S 1 -neutral, respectively).",

On the other hand, the contribution of the five-membered ring to the frontier orbitals explains ( Figure  S4) the spectral differences with respect to C (Table S2). In particular, in \u03b5C \u03c0\u03c0*2 gets closer to \u03c0\u03c0*1, while its intensity decreases, leading to the disappearance of the large shoulder/ shallow maximum at 240\u2212250 nm present in the experimental spectrum of C (see Figure S1) and due to \u03c0\u03c0*2. The dark excited states are also affected by the imidazole moiety, since the lowest energy n\u03c0* state of C, involving the lone pair (LP) of N3, disappears. The lowest energy dark state (S 3 ) in \u03b5C, hereafter labeled as n\u03c0*, corresponds mainly to an excitation from the carbonyl lone pair toward a \u03c0* orbital (similar to the LUMO+1) and, as for C in water, is less stable than \u03c0\u03c0*2.",

We have obtained the ground-state structures for C(60-n)Nn for n = 1-12, which show higher stability with a single nitrogen in a pentagon and two nonadjacent nitrogen atoms in a hexagon. Nitrogen doping leads to structural deformation, with the diameter showing variation from (7.14 - 0.24) to (7.14 + 0.10) A. The average diameter of C(60-n)Nn shows a small decrease for n &gt; or = 5, with a minimum value of 7.06 A for n = 12. The change in the average diameter signifies the volume contraction, which is also maximum for C48N12. The binding energy per atom is found to decrease as a function of the number of N atoms. The HOMO-LUMO gap is found to decrease with an increase in substitutional nitrogen atoms; however, no systematic pattern could be observed. The Mulliken charge analysis performed on all optimized geometries shows a charge transfer of -0.3 to -0.45 (or 0.3-0.45 electrons) from nitrogen to carbon atoms, resulting in nitrogen atoms behaving as electrophilic sites. The harmonic vibrational frequency analysis shows the absence of any imaginary mode. The vibrational frequencies are found to decrease with an increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in C(60-n)Nn.

This paper aims to solve this controversy. By using a different version of MRPT, the n-electron valence state perturbation theory method, the description provided by TD-DFT is confirmed: the lowest B(u) singlet state has a HOMO--&gt;LUMO nature and a large oscillator strength (HOMO refers to highest occupied molecular orbital and LUMO refers to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), while the second B(u) singlet state has a mixed HOMO-1--&gt;LUMO and HOMO--&gt;LUMO+1 nature, has an oscillator strength almost vanishing, and is located at 0.6-0.7 eV higher than the first excited state.

We use near edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy to obtain the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) with respect to the N(1s) core level of the molecule. A systematic energy shift of the N(1s) to LUMO transition is found along a series of 3d metal octaethylporphyrins and explained by density functional theory.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

However, the effect of modifying the performance of g-C 3 N 4 is still under debate. In this communication, we show the size and functional group effects on the g-C 3 N 4 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that a molecule with six repeated g-C 3 N 4 units (g-C 3 N 4 -6) could be the smallest unit that converges to the limit of its HOMO-LUMO gap. Calculations of g-C 3 N 4 -6 with varying numbers of substituted C\u2261N, C=O, and O\u2212H functional groups show that C\u2261N and C=O could narrow down the HOMO-LUMO gap, while O\u2212H could slightly raise the gap.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

The isosurfaces for several frontier orbitals and their energies are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 2, respectively. As Fig. 4 suggests, all four combinations of optimization and electronic structure methods considered predict the HOMO (orbital index 0) localization on the SubPc fragment, whereas the triply degenerate LUMO (orbitals 1, 2, and 3) is always localized on the C 60 fragment. The degeneracies may be slightly lifted, depending on the particular method used, but remain clearly defined. The HOMO-LUMO gap varies from 3.94 eV to 5.05 eV for all protocols other than UFF/EHT (Table 3). These values are notably overestimated with respect to the 1.9 eV gap between isolated SubPc and C 60 orbitals, as reported by Wilcox et al. 47 The UFF/EHT method predicts a 0.7 eV HOMO-LUMO gap, which is somewhat closer to the abovementioned value. It should be noted that in an earlier work, 48 the HOMO-LUMO gap was assessed based on the orbital energies of the two individual fragments.

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The ability of molecules with respect to electron donation or electron affinity can be determined using HOMO or LUMO energy values. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity. A high value of H-L implies high stability of molecules and lower reactivity in chemical reactions, while a low value of H-L implies low stability and higher molecular reactivity [22,33].",

The energy of HOMO orbital was similar for the sodium salt and CA, whereas for the copper, zinc, cobalt and nickel complexes this value increased significantly. The difference in the energy of HOMO and LUMO (\u0394E) orbitals was greater for sodium salt, whereas \u0394E for complexes were much smaller than for the acid. The values of the energy of HOMO and LUMO orbitals reflects the chemical reactivity of the compound with free radicals. A soft molecule-a molecule with a small value of \u2206E-is more polarized and more reactive than a hard one, because it easily offers electrons to an acceptor [33].

As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV. Koopman's theorem is used to calculate molecular orbital energies, which allows closed-shell molecules to duplicate the molecule's reactivity. Based on the global reactivity characteristics, the molecule's calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronegativity are 5.65, 0.91, and 3.74 eV. The chemical hardness is also another important molecular property that explains the resistance of the atoms in the molecule to either polarize or deform their electron density clouds, the value is 2.83 eV. Fig. 8 depicts the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, with blue and red color surface distributions indicating positive and negative locations in the molecular orbital wave function, respectively. The keto and methyl groups in the molecule have a high concentration of HOMO and LUMO.\n\n\nNonlinear optical properties (NLO)",

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

The HOMO energy characterizes the ability to donate an electron and the LUMO energy characterizes the ability to obtain an electron, and the gap between HOMO and LUMO characterizes chemical stability of the molecule. The HOMO and LUMO energies for MMTZ have been calculated by the B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) method for the title compound and the calculation reveals that there were 30 occupied and 167 unoccupied molecular orbitals associated with MMTZ. The energy values were computed below HOMO energy = -5.952766 eV LUMO energy = -0.576882 eV HOMO-LUMO energy gap = 5.375884 eVConclusionThe Raman and FT-IR spectra of MMTZ were measured. The optimized molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of MMTZ were calculated using B3LYP /6-311++G (d, p) basis sets. The scaled vibrational frequencies calculated of this molecule were agreed quite well with the experimental frequencies. Potential energy distribution of each frequency was obtained using the program GAR2PED, and the overall recognition of the vibrational frequencies assignment were made.

Our results are also in agreement with the outcome of density functional theory calculations [81], where the \u03c0 HOMO wavefunction was found to be delocalized along adenine, with greater probabilities in atoms N7, N3, C6, C5, C8, and the lowest in atom N9, as well as with recent time-dependent density functional theory predictions [76], where the HOMO wavefunction is distributed all over the molecule except from atom N9.\n\nWe find the LUMO energy of adenine at \u22124.4 eV.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set.

Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The reactivity of (I) toward nucleophiles can be inferred from the electron density on LUMO, which is predominantly the * orbital of diacetylene C atoms (Fig. 9). The HOMO is a -type MO and is mainly delocalized along the diacetylene fragment (Fig. 9).

Fukui was the first to discover the critical role of the HOMO and LUMO in governing chemical reactions. The energy gap determines the kinetic stability and bioactivity of a molecule. 50,51 The larger energy gap indicates low chemical reactivity, and the smaller energy gap exhibits high reactivity. Hence, the smaller the energy difference, the greater the reactivity and the lesser the stability of a complex. 51 The energy of the HOMO and LUMO and their energy difference were computed to explore the chemical reactivity and stability and to estimate the quantum chemical descriptors of the rhenium complexes, respectively.

HOMO is the electron rich molecular orbital with high energy (nucleophile) and electron donating capability whereas LUMO is the electron deficient molecular orbital with smaller energy (electrophile) and own electron accepting ability.\n\nThe energy difference between HOMO-LUMO orbital is called energy gap ( E), which is used to describe the stability of molecules. For compounds 3a and 3 b , E HOMO and E LUMO values were obtained by the DFT method using B3LYP/6-311 g(d,p) level and the 3D molecular orbital energies of the compounds 3a and 3b are depicted in Fig. 7 . From the Fig. 7 , the band gap energy ( E) between HOMO and LUMO orbitals were found to be 5.0 and 4.65 eV, respectively for 3a and 3b. It can be further discussed that 3b shows about 0.5 eV less compared to 3a due to the presence of electron donating methoxy substituent in the phenyl group, which further increase the electron delocalization.\n\nFurther using the energy of HOMO-LUMO orbitals, global chemical reactivity descriptor (GCRD) such as electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), Electronegativity ( \u03c7), hardness ( \u03b7), softness (S) potential ( \u03bc), and electrophilicity index ( \u03c9) were calculated.",

Further, the energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO, also known as the HOMO-LUMO gap, is a measure of the stability of a molecule and its ability to donate or accept electrons. In the context of biological activity, the energy gap is important because it determines how reactive a molecule is to other molecules and how easily it can participate in chemical reactions such as binding to proteins or enzymes [68] . A small energy gap indicates a more reactive molecule, while a large energy gap indicates a less reactive and more stable molecule.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020).

From the previous studies it is known that for uranyl dication coordinated by ligands the lowest excited state arises from the \u03c3 u highest molecular orbital (HOMO) to the \u03b4 u lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO). The HOMO corresponds to the bonding combination of uranium 5f and 6p and oxygen 2p atomic orbitals, and 3p orbital of first-shell ligands, while the LUMO is a nonbonding uranium 5f orbital ( Figure 8). The detailed analysis of the atomic orbitals contributions performed with multi-reference CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent field) calculations by Pierloot and van Beisen [20] suggests that the lowestlying excitation corresponds to a metal-centered transition from the bonding to nonbonding orbital of uranium, with a marginal ligand-to-metal charge transfer character. Hence, we can use in our discussion the UO 2 2+ spinfree notations (D \u221eh ), thus labelling the ground state as 1 \u03a3 + g and the luminescent state as 3 \u2206 g . The vertical absorption E VA and emission E VE energies, were obtained at all-electron SOC CAM-B3LYP level of theory and are reported here together with experimental values (Table IV). They were computed with the summation of the fully relativistic electronic vertical energies associated with the spin-free zero-point energies correction. It should be noted that the experimental data correspond to the band-origin values obtained from polarized absorption or luminescence spectra and emission energies taken from UV-Visible spectroscopic measurements. Thus the direct comparison with theoretical re- sults is not relevant, but we rather discuss whether the theoretical data reproduce the experimental trends. As seen in Table IV, the vertical absorption energy of [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2increases by 85 cm \u22121 with the addition of acetone due to its small polarity. A blue shift of 117 cm \u22121 is observed when chlorides are replaced by bromides ligands. On the contrary, the band origins seem red shifted by 128 cm \u22121 , from chloride to bromide complexes according to experimental data",

In case of a closed-shell molecule, the orbital occupancy can be either 2 (doubly occupied) or 0 (empty orbital), however, in case of an open-shell molecule, this occupancy varies in between 0 and 2 . Therefore, for a closed-shell molecule, the LUNO+i occupancy is 0 and it increases as the molecule start to develop open-shell character, and approaches a value of 1 for a pure open-shell molecule. Therefore, a closed-shell (y i = 0), intermediate (0 < y i < 1), and pure (y i = 1) polyradical molecule can be defined by y i values . Here, the polyradical (y i ) indexes obtained from population analysis of natural orbitals as the occupation numbers of lowest unoccupied natural orbitals (LUNOs).\n\nNucleus independent chemical shift (NICS(0)) (Schleyer et al., 2001) is computed by the gauge-independent atomic orbital (GIAO) (Ditchfield, 1974) method on the optimized geometry by single point energy calculation placing a ghost atom at the center of the macromolecules and also on each rings along the conjugated backbone. NICS is an excellent probe for the magnetic index of aromaticity or antiaromaticity of a molecule. A high negative NICS value indicates molecule as aromatic, a positive NICS value indicates as antiaromatic, and a 0 (zero) value indicates the corresponding molecule as nonaromatic.",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule.

Figure 3 shows their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and HOMO\u2212LUMO gap, which includes the frontier molecular orbitals of empty C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 for comparison. For empty C 66 H 4 , the HOMO level is \u22126.92 eV, while the LUMO level is \u22122.90 eV, and hence the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap equals to 4.02 eV. For empty C 70 Cl 6 , the corresponding values are \u22127.54, \u22123.30, and 4.24 eV, respectively.

This result is mainly attributed to the introduction of additional Li and F energy levels, which thereby reduce the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap. The stability of thermally dynamically favored fullerene can also be judged with HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps. Generally, fullerenes with a smaller HOMO\u2212LUMO gap possess lower dynamic stability and higher reactivity. 34      Previous research studies have reported that the backdonation of charge indicates the covalent interactions between the inner atoms and the carbon cage. 35,36 Herein, we first performed localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis on X@ C 66 H 4 and X@C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) to study such interactions. As shown in Figure 4, the LOL function between Li atoms and carbon atoms is sparsely distributed, while a highly localized region occurs between F atoms and carbon atoms.

The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev. In this case, the reaction site is located on the histamine unit (Table 1). So, the large gap obtained by PM3 implies high stability and low chemical reactivity of Cu(Hist)Cl 2 . The chemical reactivity and stability of a molecule is representing by the chemical hardness (\u03b7). We deduce from this result that Cu(Hist)Cl 2 molecule has high chemical reactivity and stable under PM3 (Figure 3). Fig. 3. Molecular Orbital calculating for Cu(Hist)Cl 2 using PM3 method.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity.

The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV.

Despite this, the highly unsaturated carbon chains could also exhibit various reaction properties (photoisomerization, nucleophilic addition of alcohols, thiols and amines to the triple bond) under special conditions (Shi et al., 2014). The reactivity of (I) toward nucleophiles can be inferred from the electron density on LUMO, which is predominantly the * orbital of diacetylene C atoms (Fig. 9). The HOMO is a -type MO and is mainly delocalized along the diacetylene fragment (Fig. 9).

From the data analysis, it was clearly observed that the theoretical energy band gap value, 3.49 eV was in good agreement with the experimental optical band gap, 3.49 eV obtained from UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy.Notably, the electron cloud of the HOMO in HMTS is mainly located on the electron withdrawing trifluromethyl substituent, whereas the LUMO is dominated by orbitals from the stilbene aromatic system.Generally, such electron distribution imparts to the investigated molecule an intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer property, which is consistent with the experimental spectroscopic data.In addition, this minimal overlapping of HOMO-LUMO also afforded HMTS with smaller energy for photo-excitation and relaxation, thus its theoretical band gap energy (E g ) was calculated as 3.49 eV which lies in the typical band gap range of organic semiconducting materials.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHMTS featuring donor (D)-\u03c0-acceptor (A) properties has been successfully synthesised with good yield (75%).The optical band gap of this derivative exhibited is 3.49 eV, which showed good relationship between the experimental and theoretical data.Indeed, the material possesses good thermal stability at high temperature up to ca. 270\u00baC.Thus, the findings showed that the targeted molecule can be a material candidate to be used candidate in organic semiconductor application.\n\n\n5.\n\nFigure 1 :\n1\nFigure 1: Molecular structure of HMTS.",

YA3 and YA4 exhibited approximately similar HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gaps with minute difference but still narrow as compared to the reference molecule, and this might be due to addition of 2-(5,6-dichloro-2-methylene-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile and 2-(2-methylene-3-oxo-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile as acceptor moieties, respectively.

Properly closed-shell isomers of fullerenes with antibonding LUMOs were found to have an exceptionally large T value irrespective of the number of constituent carbon atoms and are hence predicted to be kinetically very stable.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory.

The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

For these reasons, in this part, we have to determine the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and their properties like energy gap since they are used to provide information on the transfer of charges (Gatfaoui et al., 2019;. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) are very important parameters for quantum chemistry . These orbitals allow determining the manner the molecule interacts with other species. LUMO, related with the ionization potential, can be thought the most frontiers orbital having free places for accepting electrons. On the other hand HOMO, related with the electron affinity of the molecule, represents the capability to donate electrons. Therefore, studying frontiers orbitals of molecules can provide important information to explore the mechanism of action and determine the active sites (Tahenti et al., 2020). Hence, the reactivity of the chloroquine derivatives is predicted by using the differences between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Those orbitals were determined via TD-DFT approach and the pictorial illustrations are given in Figs. 5 and S2. The green color corresponds to the negative phase, while the positive phase is represented by the red color. The distributions of these orbitals and energies are very useful indicators of reactivity . Concerning the hydroxychloroquine molecule, the energy level of the HOMO orbital is equal to \u00c05.553 eV and the energy level of the LUMO orbital E LUMO = \u00c01.052 eV (in gas phase). The energy separation value between HOMO and LUMO is called energy gap and it is found to be 4.500 eV (in ultimate value), while it is equal to 4.376 eV in water As everyone knows, the quantum chemical parameters of the molecule are very important for its practical application. Therefore, in this paper we calculated several quanta chemical reactivity using FMOs energies. Table 2 represents the calculated reactivity descriptors such as the energies of frontier molecular orbitals (E HOMO , E LUMO ), energy band gap, ionization potential, electron affinity, chemical hardness, chemical softness, electronegativity, chemical potential, electrophilicity index and the maximum charge transfer index.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity. As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV. Koopman's theorem is used to calculate molecular orbital energies, which allows closed-shell molecules to duplicate the molecule's reactivity. Based on the global reactivity characteristics, the molecule's calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronegativity are 5.65, 0.91, and 3.74 eV. The chemical hardness is also another important molecular property that explains the resistance of the atoms in the molecule to either polarize or deform their electron density clouds, the value is 2.83 eV.

A DFT and molecular docking studyTheory of frontier molecular orbital (FMOs) is an invaluable tool to discuss the energy transition of the charge density because these FMOs play a key role in optical, electrical and chemical properties of compounds [51,52]. Thus, HOMO (electron donor) represents the highest occupied molecular orbital, while lowest unoccupied orbital LUMO (electron acceptor) that takes part in chemical stability [53]. These two bands describe the capacity of a molecule to offer an electron and to gain an electron respectively. Furthermore, HOMO-LUMO are energetically  separated by an energy gap, also they plays an important role to characterize the chemical reactivity and chemical hardness-softness as well as optical polarizability of 4MBN [54]. Hence, the HOMO-LUMO plots of 4MBN were carried out in gas phase and in solvent effect (ethanol and water) which are given in Figure 19. As seen this figure, two important molecular orbital (MO) was examined which presented by two colors: green color represents negatively charged surfaces (nucleophilic sites), while red color indicates positively charged surfaces (electrophilic sites).",

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity.

It is a popular quantum mechanical descriptor for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (Zhou and Parr, 1990). They play a significant role in governing a wide range of chemical interactions. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of the four monomers are evaluated and listed in Figure 2. The OCT compounds are alpha molecular orbital level (32) and alpha molecular orbital level (33), which depend on the HOMO-LUMO gap, respectively. The energy values of the HOMO (32) orbital and LUMO (33) orbital were laying at an energy value of -8.53 and -0.02 eV, respectively. The detailed data can be found in Supplementary Table S1. In comparing these HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of different compounds, the ABE shows the highest value of 201.25 kcal/mol. The higher HOMO-LUMO energy gap implies the kinetic energy is higher and has high chemical reactivity (Saranya et al., 2018). The result indicates that the allyl ether monomers are more highly reactive than the allyl analog.\n\nThe BDE of C-H bonds in the donors is the key to hydrogen transfer (Zhou et al., 2016). As can be seen from the data in Figure 3, we found that ACE and ABE monomers have the lower BDE value at 78.67 and 79.42 kcal/mol, indicating two C-H bonds are more easily broken than others.

The bond angle equally gives information on the distribution   The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are the two grand parameters for which the global indices of reactivity are derived. 48 The change in energy between the HOMO and LUMO can be referred to as HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gap, which is the lowest energy electronic excitation possible in a molecule. 49 When the mobility of the \u03c0 electrons is greater in large conjugated \u03c0 orbital systems, the energy distribution tends to be higher throughout the molecule. Fukui was the first to discover the critical role of the HOMO and LUMO in governing chemical reactions. The energy gap determines the kinetic stability and bioactivity of a molecule. 50,51 The larger energy gap indicates low chemical reactivity, and the smaller energy gap exhibits high reactivity. Hence, the smaller the energy difference, the greater the reactivity and the lesser the stability of a complex. 51 The energy of the HOMO and LUMO and their energy difference were computed to explore the chemical reactivity and stability and to estimate the quantum chemical descriptors of the rhenium complexes, respectively.

The bond angle equally gives information on the distribution   The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are the two grand parameters for which the global indices of reactivity are derived. 48 The change in energy between the HOMO and LUMO can be referred to as HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gap, which is the lowest energy electronic excitation possible in a molecule. 49 When the mobility of the \u03c0 electrons is greater in large conjugated \u03c0 orbital systems, the energy distribution tends to be higher throughout the molecule. Fukui was the first to discover the critical role of the HOMO and LUMO in governing chemical reactions. The energy gap determines the kinetic stability and bioactivity of a molecule. 50,51 The larger energy gap indicates low chemical reactivity, and the smaller energy gap exhibits high reactivity. Hence, the smaller the energy difference, the greater the reactivity and the lesser the stability of a complex. 51 The energy of the HOMO and LUMO and their energy difference were computed to explore the chemical reactivity and stability and to estimate the quantum chemical descriptors of the rhenium complexes, respectively.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The FMO of a molecule is the \"frontier\" of an electron that helps to determine the energy difference between two orbitals HOMO and LUMO. HOMO is mainly an electron donor (nucleophilic) and LUMO is an electron acceptor (electrophilic) in nature and the interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor pair can dominate other chemical reactivity of a molecule [32]. During the electrophilic-nucleophilic reaction, electrons from the HOMO jump to the LUMO and produce an energy difference between two molecular orbitals. The energy difference between two molecular orbitals is known as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which can explain the photochemistry and the strength and stability of transition metal complexes of organic molecules. To understand the sensitivity of atoms toward electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks, the HOMO and LUMO energy were calculated by using the Schr\u00f6dinger Jaguar version 10.9 [27], and the energy difference between two molecular orbital HOMO-LUMO gaps was calculated from the following Equation (3).\n\u2206E (gap) = E LUMO \u2212 E HOMO(3)\nwhere, \u2206E is the HOMO-LUMO gaps, E LUMO is the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital energy, and E HOMO is the highest energy occupied molecular orbital energy.\n\n\nRe-Docking and Interaction Analysis\n\nGeometry optimized through the DFT-based QM method of selected three compounds has been retrieved and docked again to the same binding site of the MERS-COV S1-NTD.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

In this section, we will explain the difference between the two nomenclatures. We use the abbreviation HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital), when we are discussing the gas-phase properties of the molecules. Whereas, if the molecule is in between two metal electrodes, i.e., in a metal-molecule-metal junction, we use the term HOPS (Highest Occupied \u03c0-State). The distinction arises because of the fact that in a metal-moleculemetal junction, the highest occupied energy level will be localized on the metal atoms. While, we are only interested in the energy level whose electron density is localized on the conjugated molecule. This is shown in Fig. S22. Figure S22: Explaining the nomenclature: A) When we discuss the gas-phase highest occupied molecular level, we use HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital).

Vibronic coupling has been shown to play an important role dictating the nature of the observed excited states, especially for the lowest (1)B(1) state. The 2(1)B(1) state is proposed to have its origin at 7.026 eV according to the vibrational excitation reported in this energy region (7.8-8.4 eV).

To elucidate the substitution effect of the chlorine atom on the HOMO of pyridine, we obtained one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analysed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectra of 2-CP having 35Cl or 37Cl to analyse the isotope effect on the vibrational mode. Based on the 0-0 band in the MATI spectrum of 2-CP having 35Cl, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined to be 9.4743 \u00b1 0.0005 eV (76\u2009415 \u00b1 4 cm-1) with a similar value for 37Cl, which is much lower but more accurate than the vertical value of 9.63 eV determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the MATI spectrum, which was affected by the geometrical change with respect to the neutral geometry upon ionization, could be analysed by Franck-Condon fitting and spectral correlation between the two isotopomers. Notably, we observed the appearance of the out-of-plane ring bending modes resulting from ring distortion, unlike in pyridine. Furthermore, natural bond orbital analysis led to the conclusion that the warped structure with C1 symmetry of cationic 2-CP is induced by the electron removal from the HOMO consisting of the \u03c0 orbital in the pyridine ring, which is stabilized by hyperconjugation with the lone-pair p orbitals of a nitrogen and chlorine atom.",

HOMO and LUMO energies (E HOMO and E LUMO ), energy gap (Eg), electronegativity (\u03c7), electron affinity (EA), softness (\u03b6), chemical potential (\u00b5), ionization potential (IP), hardness (\u03b7), global electrophilicity index (\u03c9), maximum charge transfer index (\u2206N max ), and nucleophilicity index (N) for the heptanal, linoleic acid, camphene, and \u03b1-humulene molecules have been computed at the B3LYP/6-31 G (d, p) basis set in the gas phase and water. The data are given in Table 3. These quantum chemical descriptors, determined with the help of HOMO and LUMO energies, can be defined as: [35][36][37]  The band gap energy value of the heptanal(a), linoleic acid (b), camphene (c), and \u03b1-humulene (d) molecules were calculated as 6.3332, 6.6905, 7.0992, and 6.4197 eV, respectively.  The smaller the energy gap, the more reactive and less stable that molecule [33], and according to these values, we can say that the most reactive molecule is the 1st molecule  The band gap energy value of the heptanal (a), linoleic acid (b), camphene (c), and \u03b1humulene (d) molecules were calculated as 6.3332, 6.6905, 7.0992, and 6.4197 eV, respectively.",

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

Using HOMO and LUMO orbital energies, the ionization potential (I), electron affinity (A), electronegativity (\u03c7), hardness (\u03b7) and softness (\u03c3) can be expressed as:\nI = -E HOMO ; A = -E LUMO \u03b7 = (I P -A)/2; \u03c7 = (I + A)/2 \u03c3 = 1/ \u03b7 and \u03c9 = \u03b7 2 /2\u00b5\nWhich are given by Koopman's theorem [33]. The conversion factors for \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03bc and HOMO, LUMO energies in atomic and cgs units: 1 atomic unit (a.u.) = 0.1482\u00d710 -24 electrostatic unit (esu) for polarizability; 1 a.u. = 8.639418\u00d710 -33 esu for first hyperpolarizability; 1 a.u. = 0.50367\u00d710 -39 esu for second hyperpolarizability; 1 a.u. = 27.2116 eV (electron volt) for HOMO and LUMO energies.\n\n\nNMR spectral analysis",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

FMOs refer to the collective term of a molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap (i.e., the gap) between the HOMO and the LUMO reveals the charge transfer of electrons. The gap defines the first excited state, reflecting the dynamical stability and chemical reactivity of the molecule. Figure 11 shows the energy level diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C16, where the HOMO and LUMO are both distributed in the carboxyl and amido. The HOMO of the secondary orbitals is distributed in the carboxyl group, indicating the nucleophilic region, and the LUMO is located in the amido group, indicating the electrophilic region. Figure 12 shows the energy level diagrams of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C17, whose distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO on the functional groups is the same as that of 3C16. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C16 is 0.2858 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6803 eV. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C17 is 0.2855 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6966 eV.

The difference between energies of LUMO and HOMO orbitals, that is, the energy gap (ELUMO-EHOMO), is indicative of the chemical reactivity and kinetic stability of molecules [41,42]: a molecule with a wide HOMO-LUMO gap is identified as having high chemical hardness and good stability, and is much less polarizable.

A high HOMO energy is characteristic of a molecule more active in reactions with electrophiles, while a low LUMO energy corresponds to molecular reactions with nucleophiles [44].

This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal.

To elucidate the substitution effect of the chlorine atom on the HOMO of pyridine, we obtained one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analysed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectra of 2-CP having 35Cl or 37Cl to analyse the isotope effect on the vibrational mode. Based on the 0-0 band in the MATI spectrum of 2-CP having 35Cl, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined to be 9.4743 \u00b1 0.0005 eV (76\u2009415 \u00b1 4 cm-1) with a similar value for 37Cl, which is much lower but more accurate than the vertical value of 9.63 eV determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the MATI spectrum, which was affected by the geometrical change with respect to the neutral geometry upon ionization, could be analysed by Franck-Condon fitting and spectral correlation between the two isotopomers. Notably, we observed the appearance of the out-of-plane ring bending modes resulting from ring distortion, unlike in pyridine. Furthermore, natural bond orbital analysis led to the conclusion that the warped structure with C1 symmetry of cationic 2-CP is induced by the electron removal from the HOMO consisting of the \u03c0 orbital in the pyridine ring, which is stabilized by hyperconjugation with the lone-pair p orbitals of a nitrogen and chlorine atom.",

The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV.

These results are given in Table 3 and the representations are shown in Figure 3. The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev. In this case, the reaction site is located on the histamine unit (Table 1). So, the large gap obtained by PM3 implies high stability and low chemical reactivity of Cu(Hist)Cl 2 . The chemical reactivity and stability of a molecule is representing by the chemical hardness (\u03b7).

In this study, we considered a number of radicals from smallest diatomic anion radicals such as superoxide anion radical to one-electron oxidized DNA related base radicals that show the SOMO is energetically lower than one or more doubly occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) (SOMO-HOMO level inversion). The electronic configurations are calculated employing the B3LYP/6-31++G** method, with the inclusion of aqueous phase via the integral equation formalism of the polarized continuum model solvation model. From the extensive study of the electronic configurations of radicals produced by one-electron oxidation or reduction of natural-DNA bases, bromine-, sulfur-, selenium-, and aza-substituted DNA bases, as well as 20 diatomic molecules, we highlight the following important findings: (i) SOMO-HOMO level inversion is a common phenomenon in radical species. (ii) The more localized spin density in \u03c3-orbital on a single atom (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or selenium), the greater the gap between HOMO and SOMO. (iii) In species with SOMO-HOMO level inversion, one-electron oxidation takes place from HOMO not from the SOMO, which produces a molecule in its triplet ground state. Oxidation of aqueous superoxide anion producing triplet molecular oxygen is one example of many. (iv) These results are for conventional radicals and in contrast with those reported for distonic radical anions in which SOMO-HOMO gaps are smaller for more localized radicals and the orbital inversions vanish in water. Our findings yield new insights into the properties of free radical systems.",

While Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is related to ionization potential, and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, average energy values for HOMO and LUMO are connected to electronegativity (Prasad and Ojha, 2017). HOMO and LUMO of the molecule were plotted using the same level theory. These Frontier Molecular Orbitals  (FMOs) and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be seen in Fig. 10.

To elucidate the substitution effect of the chlorine atom on the HOMO of pyridine, we obtained one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analysed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectra of 2-CP having 35Cl or 37Cl to analyse the isotope effect on the vibrational mode. Based on the 0-0 band in the MATI spectrum of 2-CP having 35Cl, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined to be 9.4743 \u00b1 0.0005 eV (76\u2009415 \u00b1 4 cm-1) with a similar value for 37Cl, which is much lower but more accurate than the vertical value of 9.63 eV determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the MATI spectrum, which was affected by the geometrical change with respect to the neutral geometry upon ionization, could be analysed by Franck-Condon fitting and spectral correlation between the two isotopomers. Notably, we observed the appearance of the out-of-plane ring bending modes resulting from ring distortion, unlike in pyridine. Furthermore, natural bond orbital analysis led to the conclusion that the warped structure with C1 symmetry of cationic 2-CP is induced by the electron removal from the HOMO consisting of the \u03c0 orbital in the pyridine ring, which is stabilized by hyperconjugation with the lone-pair p orbitals of a nitrogen and chlorine atom.",

These changes resulted in the lowering of the energy gap, E Gap , (4.23\u22122.61 eV) due to the increase in the conjugation 98 of SP1, consistent with the results shown in Figure 2A. Upon binding with Cu 2+ , both the HOMO (\u22126.69 eV) and LUMO (\u22124.33 eV) energies decreased, with the LUMO energy decreased more than the HOMO energy\n\nFigure 9 .\n9HOMO and LUMO orbitals and energy levels of closed form, open form, and the SP1\u2212Cu 2+ complex.",

The E LUMO and the E HOMO of the complex a are -0.0859 and -0.1651 eV, respectively, and the energy gap between E LUMO and E HOMO is equal to 0.0792 eV, that is, \u0394E=0.0792 eV. It shows that in order to generate an excited state, 0.0792 eV will be absorbed by the ground state molecules of complex a. However, the calculated E LUMO and the E HOMO of complex b are -0.0881 eV and -0.1948 eV, respectively, and the energy gap (\u0394E L\u2212H ) is 0.1067 eV. From the above results, it can be shown that the stability of complex b is significantly higher than that of complex a. At the same time, the energy gap of complex a is lower than that of complex b. In summary, it can directly reflect that the stability of the complex formed by the ligand and Fe is better than that formed by the ligand and Zn. It means that the stability of the complex formed by Zn is stronger than that formed by Fe. Therefore, if zinc atoms are used to replace the iron atoms in heme, the replaced complexes will have better stability.  \n\n\nConclusion",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

Our correlations using a systematic evaluation of the HOMO energies can be of predictive value in the search for new anti-inflammatory drugs as well as for new radioprotectors.",

The spectroscopic parameters of the (1 0(0) v3)1,2 vibrational states with v3 = 0-6 have been obtained from a global rotational analysis of the six (1 0(0) v3)1,2 --&gt; (1 0(0) (v3-1))1,2 emission bands (v3 = 1-6). The (1 0(0) 5)1,2 vibrational states of both 12C16O2 and 13C16O2 have been observed by direct absorption from the vibrational ground state by Intracavity Laser Absorption Spectroscopy near 12 700 and 12 400 cm-1, respectively. The rovibrational energy levels obtained by the two experimental techniques are discussed and compared with those calculated in the framework of the effective operator approach.

While the linear X (3)Sigma(-) ground state of CNN has a real degenerate bending vibrational frequency, the A (3)Pi state of CNN is subject to the Renner-Teller effect and presents two distinct real vibrational frequencies along the bending coordinate. The bending vibrational frequencies of the A (3)Pi state were evaluated via the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) techniques. The significant sensitivity to level of theory in predicting the ground-state geometry, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and associated infrared intensities has been attributed to the fact that the reference wave function is strongly perturbed by the excitations of 1pi--&gt;3pi followed by a spin flip. At the highest level of theory with the largest basis set, correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple zeta (cc-pVQZ) CCSDT, the classical X-A splitting (T(e) value) was predicted to be 68.5 kcal/mol (2.97 eV, 24 000 cm(-1)) and the quantum mechanical splitting (T(0) value) to be 69.7 kcal/mol (3.02 eV, 24 400 cm(-1)), which are in excellent agreement with the experimental T(0) values, 67.5-68.2 kcal/mol (2.93-2.96 eV, 23 600-23 900 cm(-1)). With the EOM-CCSD method the Renner parameter (epsilon) and averaged bending vibrational frequency (omega(2)) for the A (3)Pi state were evaluated to be epsilon=-0.118 and omega(2)=615 cm(-1), respectively. They are in fair agreement with the experimental values of epsilon=-0.07 and nu(2)=525 cm(-1).",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6.

The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity. As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV. Koopman's theorem is used to calculate molecular orbital energies, which allows closed-shell molecules to duplicate the molecule's reactivity. Based on the global reactivity characteristics, the molecule's calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronegativity are 5.65, 0.91, and 3.74 eV. The chemical hardness is also another important molecular property that explains the resistance of the atoms in the molecule to either polarize or deform their electron density clouds, the value is 2.83 eV. Fig. 8 depicts the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, with blue and red color surface distributions indicating positive and negative locations in the molecular orbital wave function, respectively.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

HOMO is the electron rich molecular orbital with high energy (nucleophile) and electron donating capability whereas LUMO is the electron deficient molecular orbital with smaller energy (electrophile) and own electron accepting ability.\n\nThe energy difference between HOMO-LUMO orbital is called energy gap ( E), which is used to describe the stability of molecules.

From the Fig. 7 , the band gap energy ( E) between HOMO and LUMO orbitals were found to be 5.0 and 4.65 eV, respectively for 3a and 3b. It can be further discussed that 3b shows about 0.5 eV less compared to 3a due to the presence of electron donating methoxy substituent in the phenyl group, which further increase the electron delocalization.\n\nFurther using the energy of HOMO-LUMO orbitals, global chemical reactivity descriptor (GCRD) such as electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), Electronegativity ( \u03c7), hardness ( \u03b7), softness (S) potential ( \u03bc), and electrophilicity index ( \u03c9) were calculated.",

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The ability of molecules with respect to electron donation or electron affinity can be determined using HOMO or LUMO energy values. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity. A high value of H-L implies high stability of molecules and lower reactivity in chemical reactions, while a low value of H-L implies low stability and higher molecular reactivity [22,33].",

The order of energy gap between the two molecules is 10 (2.69 eV) > 11 (2.59 eV), respectively. The comparison between the two dyes and semiconductors shows that the two molecules can achieve effective charge separation and electron injection. The overall performance of the molecule 11 tends to be more planar, resulting in a smaller energy gap. This effect is better observed in the solvent due to dye molecules' interaction with the solvent, which results in a red-shifted absorption spectrum.  Figure 3 shows the molecular energy level diagram, including dyes and semiconductors, and dye sensitizers are higher than the CB (\u22124.0 eV) surface, ensuring the effective injection of electrons. Compared with experimental molecule TPCTh and TPCRh, Dye 10 and Dye 11 have a higher LUMO energy level, which is very beneficial for electron injection. Meanwhile, these dyes' HOMO energy level is lower than that of redox potential I\u00af/I 3\u00afe lectrolyte (\u22124.8 eV). Thus, these electron-lost sensitizers can receive electrons from the redox couple. Notably, the HOMO energy values of TPCTh and TPCRh are significantly higher than those of molecules 10 and 11, which can indicate that Dyes 10 and 11 are comfortable to obtain electrons and regenerate dyes.

E HOMO is generally associated with the electron donating ability of a molecule. High values of E HOMO are likely to denote the tendency of the molecule to donate electrons to acceptor molecules of lower energy MO. E LUMO , indicates the ability of the molecule to accept electrons [34]. The binding ability of the molecule increases with increasing HOMO and decreasing LUMO energy values. Thus, the lower the value of E LUMO , the most probable it is that the molecule would accept electrons. Fig. 6 reveal the HOMO and LUMO of the cocrystal (DAPT:PTAA).

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

Through the effort, we could compare HOMO, LUMO, HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and dipole moments between PM6//PM6 and B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6 calculations. Although discrepancies exist between the values, the coefficient of determinations exhibited for 0.877 to 0.907 for the HOMO, and 0.821 to 0.911 for the LUMO, 0.803 to 0.892 for the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, and 0.929 to 0.945 for the dipole moment.\n\nThe discovery implicates that, given identical molecular geometry, there is a high probability of achieving precise estimations for parameters such as HOMO, LUMO, HOMO-LUMO energy gaps, and dipole moments, employing machine learning methodologies. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has extensively compared between the project 59,62,63,70 generated a dataset of optimized molecular structures with electronic properties calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Unlike molecular force field-optimized PubChem3D, our data contains molecular orbitals and orbital energies by DFT calculation and semi-empirical PM6-optimized geometry. The HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO-LUMO energies, in particular, are crucial for making organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are not provided in the original PubChem.\n\nThe PubChemQC project aims to accomplish several objectives and surmount various challenges, including:\n\n\u2022 Providing a diverse and comprehensive dataset of molecular information by capitalizing on PubChem as the molecular source.",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6.

The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The bending vibrational frequencies of the A (3)Pi state were evaluated via the equation-of-motion coupled cluster (EOM-CC) techniques. The significant sensitivity to level of theory in predicting the ground-state geometry, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and associated infrared intensities has been attributed to the fact that the reference wave function is strongly perturbed by the excitations of 1pi--&gt;3pi followed by a spin flip.

The HOMO energy characterizes the ability to donate an electron and the LUMO energy characterizes the ability to obtain an electron, and the gap between HOMO and LUMO characterizes chemical stability of the molecule. The HOMO and LUMO energies for MMTZ have been calculated by the B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) method for the title compound and the calculation reveals that there were 30 occupied and 167 unoccupied molecular orbitals associated with MMTZ. The energy values were computed below HOMO energy = -5.952766 eV LUMO energy = -0.576882 eV HOMO-LUMO energy gap = 5.375884 eVConclusionThe Raman and FT-IR spectra of MMTZ were measured. The optimized molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of MMTZ were calculated using B3LYP /6-311++G (d, p) basis sets. The scaled vibrational frequencies calculated of this molecule were agreed quite well with the experimental frequencies. Potential energy distribution of each frequency was obtained using the program GAR2PED, and the overall recognition of the vibrational frequencies assignment were made.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

By using the values of the energies E HOMO and E LUMO for a molecule, the global descriptors of the chemical reactivity of the molecules such as the global hardness (M), the chemical potential ( c ), the flexibility (\u03b6), the electronegativity (\u2205), the ionization potential (IP), the electronic affinity (EA) and the electrophilicity index (\u03c9) were calculated using the mathematical formulas given earlier. These values are also recorded in Table 3. We observed that the gap energy ( E gap ) of these two molecules varies between 1 eV and 1.5 eV, these energies being less than 3 eV.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set.

The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The HOMO energy characterizes the ability to donate an electron and the LUMO energy characterizes the ability to obtain an electron, and the gap between HOMO and LUMO characterizes chemical stability of the molecule. The HOMO and LUMO energies for MMTZ have been calculated by the B3LYP/6-311++G (d, p) method for the title compound and the calculation reveals that there were 30 occupied and 167 unoccupied molecular orbitals associated with MMTZ. The energy values were computed below HOMO energy = -5.952766 eV LUMO energy = -0.576882 eV HOMO-LUMO energy gap = 5.375884 eVConclusionThe Raman and FT-IR spectra of MMTZ were measured. The optimized molecular geometry and vibrational frequencies of MMTZ were calculated using B3LYP /6-311++G (d, p) basis sets. The scaled vibrational frequencies calculated of this molecule were agreed quite well with the experimental frequencies. Potential energy distribution of each frequency was obtained using the program GAR2PED, and the overall recognition of the vibrational frequencies assignment were made.

Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character.

The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The HOMO and LUMO energies for ligands and complexes provide information on the energy distribution and energy behavior. Negative EHOMO and ELUMO values are indicative of the stability of compounds [40]. The difference between energies of LUMO and HOMO orbitals, that is, the energy gap (ELUMO-EHOMO), is indicative of the chemical reactivity and kinetic stability of molecules [41,42]: a molecule with a wide HOMO-LUMO gap is identified as having high chemical hardness and good stability, and is much less polarizable. Molecules with a narrow HOMO-LUMO gap have good chemical reactivity and chemical softness and are more polarizable. That is, a wide HOMO-LUMO gap suggests a high molecular stability and low chemical reactivity [43]. The HOMO and LUMO energies reflect the ability to donate and receive an electron, respectively. A high HOMO energy is characteristic of a molecule more active in reactions with electrophiles, while a low LUMO energy corresponds to molecular reactions with nucleophiles [44]. A molecule with a narrow boundary orbital gap is highly polarizable and exhibits a significant degree of intramolecular charge transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and conjugation, which can affect the biological activity of a molecule [45].\n\nA three-dimensional view of HOMO-LUMO is presented in Figure 6.",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6.

The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The HOMO and LUMO energies for ligands and complexes provide information on the energy distribution and energy behavior. Negative E HOMO and E LUMO values are indicative of the stability of compounds [40]. The difference between energies of LUMO and HOMO orbitals, that is, the energy gap (E LUMO -E HOMO ), is indicative of the chemical reactivity and kinetic stability of molecules [41,42]: a molecule with a wide HOMO-LUMO gap is identified as having high chemical hardness and good stability, and is much less polarizable. Molecules with a narrow HOMO-LUMO gap have good chemical reactivity and chemical softness and are more polarizable. That is, a wide HOMO-LUMO gap suggests a high molecular stability and low chemical reactivity [43]. The HOMO and LUMO energies reflect the ability to donate and receive an electron, respectively. A high HOMO energy is characteristic of a molecule more active in reactions with electrophiles, while a low LUMO energy corresponds to molecular reactions with nucleophiles [44]. A molecule with a narrow boundary orbital gap is highly polarizable and exhibits a significant degree of intramolecular charge transfer from an electron donor to an electron acceptor and conjugation, which can affect the biological activity of a molecule [45].\n\nA three-dimensional view of HOMO-LUMO is presented in Figure 6.",

In the 36 C-C bonds of the CNC structure, we found two types of bond length. One is 1.49\u00c5 which is shared between the tetragonal ring and the hexagonal ring; the other is 1.38\u00c5 which is shared between two adjacent hexagonal rings. The cohesive energy calculation, like those of the aforementioned studied adsorbents and adsorbate, was accomplished using eqn (1) and \u00c08.14 eV cohesive energy was found for this structure, which is also consistent with previous reports. 59 Its natural existence was con\ue103rmed by exploring the IR vibrational mode ranging from 375.67 cm \u00c01 to 1609.76 cm \u00c01 . The dipole moment of CNC is zero, and there is no ionic charge on the atoms, which implies the C-C bonds are covalent bonds. The HOMO and LUMO energy values are identi\ue103ed as \u00c05.87 eV and \u00c03.35 eV, respectively, showing a band gap of 2.52 eV.",

The CN radical was produced from the photolysis of BrCN at 193 nm, and the NCO radical from the CN + O(2) reaction. The NCN radical was monitored by laser-induced fluorescence with a dye laser at 329.01 nm. The rate constants derived from kinetic modeling, with a negative temperature dependence but no pressure effect, can be expressed by k = (2.15 +/- 0.70) x 10(-11) exp[(155 +/- 92)/T] cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1), where the quoted errors are two standard deviations. The reaction mechanism and rate constant have also been theoretically predicted for the temperature range of 200-3000 K at He pressures ranging from 10(-4) Torr to 1000 atm based on dual channel Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) calculations with the potential energy surface evaluated at the G2M and CCSD(T) levels.

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

Here we compute the fundamental vibrational frequencies by applying second-order vibrational perturbation theory to the complete quartic force field computed at the all-electron (AE) coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level [CCSD(T)] with the correlation-consistent, polarized core-valence quadruple-zeta (cc-pCVQZ) basis set, which has tight functions to correctly describe core correlation. The AE-CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ geometric parameters are r(e)(N-C)=1.1623 A, r(e)(C-C)=1.4370 A, r(e)(C-O)=1.1758 A, theta(e)(N-C-C)=168.55 degrees , and theta(e)(C-C-O)=132.22 degrees . Our CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ values of the characteristic stretching frequencies nu(1) and nu(2) are 2171 and 1898 cm(-1), respectively, in stark contrast to the experimentally derived values of 2093 and 1774 cm(-1). Finally, focal-point extrapolations using correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pVXZ (X=D,T,Q,5,6) and electron correlation treatments as extensive as full coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT) with perturbative accounting of quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)] determine the vibrationless barrier to linearity of NCCO and the dissociation energy (D(0)) of NCCO--&gt;NC+CO to be 8.4 and 26.5 kcal mol(-1), respectively. Using our precisely determined dissociation energy, we recommend a new 0 K enthalpy of formation for NCCO of 50.9+/-0.3 kcal mol(-1).",

This limiting one-electron energy is within a margin of +/-1 eV independent of the character of the ion and is 4 eV lower compared to the estimate obtained for the HOMO energy of the ions in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions. We argue that this discrepancy must the attributed to a shift in the reference of the one-electron potential of the periodic solvent model.",

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

Our measurements of the HHG spectrum of N2 molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization showed a maximum at the rotational half-revival. This feature indicates the influence of electrons occupying the orbital just below the N2 HOMO, referred to as the HOMO-1. Such observations of lower-lying orbitals are essential to understanding subfemtosecond/subangstrom electronic motion in laser-excited molecules.",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%). It is inferable from the low Eg \n\n\nExcitation studies\n\nThe first five excitations of the studied compound were studied in acetone, ethanol, water, and also in gas phase (no solvent) in order to understand the various interactions between molecular orbitals in its system at excited state.",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

At the aug-cc-pV5Z/UCCSD(T) level the classical adiabatic excitation energies (Te values) of the three lowest-lying quartet excited states were predicted to be 83.3 kcalmol (3.61 eV, 29 200 cm(-1)) for the \u00e3 4A2 state, 93.3 kcalmol (4.05 eV, 32 600 cm(-1)) for the b 4B2 state, and 100.8 kcalmol (4.37 eV, 35 300 cm(-1)) for the c 4A1 state. The quantum mechanical excitation energies (T 0 values) were determined to be 81.6 kcalmol (3.54 eV, 28 500 cm(-1)) for the a 4A2 state and 90.7 kcalmol (3.93 eV, 31 700 cm(-1)) for the b 4B2 state. The lowest quartet linear Renner-Teller 4Pi state gives rise to the a 4A2 state with 112.8 degrees and the b 4B2 state with 124.4 degrees &lt;(ONO) bond angles upon bending. The b state shows some peculiar behavior. Although CASSCF, RCISD, UCISD, RCCSD, UCCSD, and RCCSD(T) methods predicted the presence of a Cs equilibrium geometry (a double minimum 4A' state), SCF, UCCSD(T), and ICMRCI wave functions predicted the C2v structure for the b 4B2 state. The importance of both dynamical and nondynamical correlation treatments for the energy difference between C2v and Cs structures of b state is highlighted in this context. The c 4A1 state is predicted to have a very small bond angle of 85.8 degrees . Potential energy diagrams with respect to the bond angles of the ground state and four quartet states are presented.",

From the previous studies it is known that for uranyl dication coordinated by ligands the lowest excited state arises from the \u03c3 u highest molecular orbital (HOMO) to the \u03b4 u lowest unoccupied orbital (LUMO). The HOMO corresponds to the bonding combination of uranium 5f and 6p and oxygen 2p atomic orbitals, and 3p orbital of first-shell ligands, while the LUMO is a nonbonding uranium 5f orbital ( Figure 8). The detailed analysis of the atomic orbitals contributions performed with multi-reference CASSCF (complete active space self-consistent field) calculations by Pierloot and van Beisen [20] suggests that the lowestlying excitation corresponds to a metal-centered transition from the bonding to nonbonding orbital of uranium, with a marginal ligand-to-metal charge transfer character. Hence, we can use in our discussion the UO 2 2+ spinfree notations (D \u221eh ), thus labelling the ground state as 1 \u03a3 + g and the luminescent state as 3 \u2206 g . The vertical absorption E VA and emission E VE energies, were obtained at all-electron SOC CAM-B3LYP level of theory and are reported here together with experimental values (Table IV). They were computed with the summation of the fully relativistic electronic vertical energies associated with the spin-free zero-point energies correction. It should be noted that the experimental data correspond to the band-origin values obtained from polarized absorption or luminescence spectra and emission energies taken from UV-Visible spectroscopic measurements. Thus the direct comparison with theoretical re- sults is not relevant, but we rather discuss whether the theoretical data reproduce the experimental trends. As seen in Table IV, the vertical absorption energy of [UO 2 Cl 4 ] 2increases by 85 cm \u22121 with the addition of acetone due to its small polarity. A blue shift of 117 cm \u22121 is observed when chlorides are replaced by bromides ligands.

In case of a closed-shell molecule, the orbital occupancy can be either 2 (doubly occupied) or 0 (empty orbital), however, in case of an open-shell molecule, this occupancy varies in between 0 and 2 . Therefore, for a closed-shell molecule, the LUNO+i occupancy is 0 and it increases as the molecule start to develop open-shell character, and approaches a value of 1 for a pure open-shell molecule. Therefore, a closed-shell (y i = 0), intermediate (0 < y i < 1), and pure (y i = 1) polyradical molecule can be defined by y i values .

These results are given in Table 3 and the representations are shown in Figure 3. The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev.

The molecular orbital diagram for Ni(CO) 4 , which has the same number of electrons with the Co(CO) 3 NO but has a higher symmetry, helps us to understand where the molecular orbitals of the Co(CO) 3 NO originate from. The diagram shown in Figure S1 describes how the \u03c0 backbond forms in the Ni(CO) 4 50 . Compared with the Ni(CO) 4 , the replacement of a CO group by a NO group changes the point group from T d into C 3v in the Co(CO) 3 NO and lifts degeneracies as shown in Fig. 2d. 35 . The HOMO 3e orbitals exhibit the \u03c0 backbond between Co and ligands. Looking at unoccupied states, the LUMO and LUMO + 1 are doubly degenerate 4e orbitals, the LUMO + 2 is a nondegenerate 3a 1 orbital, and the LUMO + 3 and LUMO + 4 are doubly degenerate 5e orbitals.

Without the pyrene fragment, the binding energy now becomes much smaller in cases when LDA, PBE+vdW and vdW-DF have been used. For example, the binding energy in the PBE+vdW case is reduced to only 26.05 kJ/mol, a factor of three smaller than the value computed in the presence of the pyrene fragment, and the optimized distance d, defined as the shortest distance between the CNT and the C atom in the dinitromethane molecule, is now 3.50\u00c5. This suggests that the pyrene fragment enhances the binding between the adsorbate and the CNT, and that pyrene is a good choice for anchoring functional groups on CNTs. Note that the binding energy is higher than the thermal energy at 300 K, which is about 2.51 kJ/mol. Therefore, we expect that the molecule stay physisorbed around the room temperatures.",

S 1 presents an extended electron spatial distribution far from the nuclei due to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital, having a Rydberg character.Because of this particular electronic structure, the electron can be considered as effectively detached and some characteristics of excited Rydberg states converge to those of the related cation, in particular when describing the reactivity of the excited states (Lipsky 1981).To verify this assumption, we compared the computed relaxed geometries of neutral C 6 H 14 in the ground state S 0 , cation C 6 H 14 + in the ground state S 0 and neutral C 6 H 14 in the S 1 excited state (for simplicity, in the following we will refer to them as S 0 -neutral, S 0 -cation and S 1 -neutral, respectively).",

Figure 3 shows their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and HOMO\u2212LUMO gap, which includes the frontier molecular orbitals of empty C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 for comparison. For empty C 66 H 4 , the HOMO level is \u22126.92 eV, while the LUMO level is \u22122.90 eV, and hence the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap equals to 4.02 eV. For empty C 70 Cl 6 , the corresponding values are \u22127.54, \u22123.30, and 4.24 eV, respectively. As presented in Figure 3, compared with C 66 H 4 and C 70 Cl 6 , the HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps of X@C 66 H 4 and X@ C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) are all declined. This result is mainly attributed to the introduction of additional Li and F energy levels, which thereby reduce the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap. The stability of thermally dynamically favored fullerene can also be judged with HOMO\u2212LUMO gaps. Generally, fullerenes with a smaller HOMO\u2212LUMO gap possess lower dynamic stability and higher reactivity. 34      Previous research studies have reported that the backdonation of charge indicates the covalent interactions between the inner atoms and the carbon cage. 35,36 Herein, we first performed localized orbital locator (LOL) analysis on X@ C 66 H 4 and X@C 70 Cl 6 (X = F and Li) to study such interactions. As shown in Figure 4, the LOL function between Li atoms and carbon atoms is sparsely distributed, while a highly localized region occurs between F atoms and carbon atoms. This indicates that Li atoms and carbon atoms are mainly bound by electrostatic force and the covalent interaction is very weak, whereas F atoms interact strongly with carbon atoms through covalent bonds, consistent with the abovementioned NBO analysis.

The E LUMO and the E HOMO of the complex a are -0.0859 and -0.1651 eV, respectively, and the energy gap between E LUMO and E HOMO is equal to 0.0792 eV, that is, \u0394E=0.0792 eV. It shows that in order to generate an excited state, 0.0792 eV will be absorbed by the ground state molecules of complex a. However, the calculated E LUMO and the E HOMO of complex b are -0.0881 eV and -0.1948 eV, respectively, and the energy gap (\u0394E L\u2212H ) is 0.1067 eV. From the above results, it can be shown that the stability of complex b is significantly higher than that of complex a. At the same time, the energy gap of complex a is lower than that of complex b. In summary, it can directly reflect that the stability of the complex formed by the ligand and Fe is better than that formed by the ligand and Zn. It means that the stability of the complex formed by Zn is stronger than that formed by Fe. Therefore, if zinc atoms are used to replace the iron atoms in heme, the replaced complexes will have better stability.  \n\n\nConclusion",

HOMO -LUMO energy\n\nThe fundamental importance of HOMO and LUMO understands the chemical stability and reactivity of many organic molecules. The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.   [21]. The HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the entire molecule. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV. This smaller energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the eventual charge transfer occurs within the molecule, which influences its high polarizability and biological activities.\n\n\nE.

HOMO -LUMO energy\n\nThe fundamental importance of HOMO and LUMO understands the chemical stability and reactivity of many organic molecules. The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.   [21]. The HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the entire molecule. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV. This smaller energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the eventual charge transfer occurs within the molecule, which influences its high polarizability and biological activities.\n\n\nE.

Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%). It is inferable from the low Eg \n\n\nExcitation studies\n\nThe first five excitations of the studied compound were studied in acetone, ethanol, water, and also in gas phase (no solvent) in order to understand the various interactions between molecular orbitals in its system at excited state.",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The ability of molecules with respect to electron donation or electron affinity can be determined using HOMO or LUMO energy values. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity. A high value of H-L implies high stability of molecules and lower reactivity in chemical reactions, while a low value of H-L implies low stability and higher molecular reactivity [22,33].",

Because the electron is promoted from a bonding $\\pi$ molecular orbital to an antibonding $\\pi^{*}$ molecular orbital, we call this a $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ excitation (read as \"pi to pi star\"). The energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO of 1,3-butadiene is such that UV light of 217 nm wavelength is required to effect the $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^{*}$ electronic transition (FIGURE 14.12).\n\n\nFIGURE 14.12 Ultraviolet excitation of 1,3-butadiene results in the promotion of an electron from $\\Psi_{2}$, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), to $\\Psi_{3}{ }^{*}$, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).\n\nAn ultraviolet spectrum is recorded by irradiating a sample with UV light of continuously changing wavelength. When the wavelength corresponds to the energy level required to excite an electron to a higher level, energy is absorbed. This absorption is detected and displayed on a chart that plots wavelength versus absorbance (A), defined as\n\n$$\nA=\\log \\frac{I_{0}}{I}\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{0}$ is the intensity of the incident light and $I$ is the intensity of the light transmitted through the sample.\nNote that UV spectra differ from IR spectra in how they are presented. For historical reasons, IR spectra are usually displayed so that the baseline corresponding to zero absorption runs across the top of the chart and a valley indicates an absorption, whereas UV spectra are displayed with the baseline at the bottom of the chart so that a peak indicates an absorption (FIGURE 14.13).\n\n\nThe amount of UV light absorbed is expressed as the sample's molar absorptivity ( $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ ), defined by the equation\n\n$$\n\\varepsilon=\\frac{A}{c \\times l}\n$$",

As expected for D\u2212A molecules, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is located on the phenylenepyrimidine moiety and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is at the acridine unit. Any difference in the photophysical data between 1a and 1b must therefore be influenced by steric interactions from the bulky adamantyl groups. A slightly different picture applies for 1c where the adamantyl groups at the pyrimidine in 1c influence the LUMO with the LUMO energy 0.27 eV higher than LUMO energies for 1a and 1b, whereas the HOMO energy in 1c is only 0.05 eV higher than HOMO energies for 1a and 1b. These MO energy trends are in excellent agreement with observed cyclic voltammetry (CV) data, where the oxidation potentials for 1a\u22121c are all within 0.02 V and the reduction potential of 1c is 0.14 and 0.19 V more negative than 1a and 1b, respectively (Table S5 and Figures S58\u2212S60). The HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gaps estimated by CV data are 2.78, 2.75, and 2.93 eV for 1a, 1b, and 1c.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

Interestingly, the smallest HOMO-LUMO gap values can be seen for the systems with longer Ag-N contacts and smaller N-Ag-N angles and electron density parameters, viz.density, its Laplacian value and absolute total energy density.Generally, one may say that systems exhibiting a smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gap show greater biological activity.This feature has been demonstrated for pyrrole-2,5-dione analogs [38].\n\nLater in this study (paragraph 2.3), the IC 50 data will be presented.The HOMO-LUMO energy gap values (Table 4\n) indicate that [Ag(MCZ) 2 NO 3 ], [Ag(MTZ) 2 NO 3 ], [Ag(MTZ) 2 CH 3 SO 3 ]\nand [Ag(MTZ) 2 CF 3 CO 2 ] may exhibit the desired cytotoxic activity because they show smaller HOMO-LUMO energy gaps.However, such predictions should be made with care, as a huge variety of factors are known to affect cytotoxicity in biological systems.",

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

(1)-(6) [22]. The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap. The HOMO,   LUMO, energy gap, and global reactivity descriptors for the studied complexes calculated at B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory is presented in Table 1 while the HOMO and LUMO orbitals isosurface and respective energy levels is presented in Fig. 3 and the fact-findings reveal a decreasing order in energy gap as thus:\nA 6 > A 3 > A 1 > A 5 > A 2 > A 8 > A 4 > A 7 .",

The ability of molecules with respect to electron donation or electron affinity can be determined using HOMO or LUMO energy values. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity. A high value of H-L implies high stability of molecules and lower reactivity in chemical reactions, while a low value of H-L implies low stability and higher molecular reactivity [22,33].",

From the Fig. 7 , the band gap energy ( E) between HOMO and LUMO orbitals were found to be 5.0 and 4.65 eV, respectively for 3a and 3b. It can be further discussed that 3b shows about 0.5 eV less compared to 3a due to the presence of electron donating methoxy substituent in the phenyl group, which further increase the electron delocalization.\n\nFurther using the energy of HOMO-LUMO orbitals, global chemical reactivity descriptor (GCRD) such as electron affinity (EA), ionization potential (IP), Electronegativity ( \u03c7), hardness ( \u03b7), softness (S) potential ( \u03bc), and electrophilicity index ( \u03c9) were calculated.",

The order of energy gap between the two molecules is 10 (2.69 eV) > 11 (2.59 eV), respectively. The comparison between the two dyes and semiconductors shows that the two molecules can achieve effective charge separation and electron injection. The overall performance of the molecule 11 tends to be more planar, resulting in a smaller energy gap. This effect is better observed in the solvent due to dye molecules' interaction with the solvent, which results in a red-shifted absorption spectrum.  Figure 3 shows the molecular energy level diagram, including dyes and semiconductors, and dye sensitizers are higher than the CB (\u22124.0 eV) surface, ensuring the effective injection of electrons. Compared with experimental molecule TPCTh and TPCRh, Dye 10 and Dye 11 have a higher LUMO energy level, which is very beneficial for electron injection. Meanwhile, these dyes' HOMO energy level is lower than that of redox potential I\u00af/I 3\u00afe lectrolyte (\u22124.8 eV). Thus, these electron-lost sensitizers can receive electrons from the redox couple. Notably, the HOMO energy values of TPCTh and TPCRh are significantly higher than those of molecules 10 and 11, which can indicate that Dyes 10 and 11 are comfortable to obtain electrons and regenerate dyes.

As shown in Table 2, the LUMO energies of 1H4M, 1H5M, and 1H8M are almost identical, and almost unaffected by differences in the position of the substituent. This is consistent with the similarity of the first half-wave reduction potentials. Conversely, for the HOMO energy, that of 1H4M is larger than those of 1H5M and 1H8M; i.e., the HOMO is shallow. This indicates that 1H4M is more readily oxidized than the other compounds, consistent with the experimental result showing that only 1H4M exhibits an oxidation peak. These results showed that, even for compounds with the same substituent, the HOMO energy was influenced by the substitution position.

The energy gap determines the kinetic stability and bioactivity of a molecule. 50,51 The larger energy gap indicates low chemical reactivity, and the smaller energy gap exhibits high reactivity. Hence, the smaller the energy difference, the greater the reactivity and the lesser the stability of a complex. 51 The energy of the HOMO and LUMO and their energy difference were computed to explore the chemical reactivity and stability and to estimate the quantum chemical descriptors of the rhenium complexes, respectively.

[31] Table 2 presented the energy of HOMO (E HOMO ), the energy of LUMO (E LUMO ) and the energy gap (\u0394E LUMO-HOMO ) of every compound. It is found that values of E HOMO and E LUMO were from \u00c0 8.69 eV (compound A2) to \u00c0 6.85 eV (compound F1) and from \u00c0 3.37 eV (compound A2) to \u00c0 1.97 eV (compound F1), respectively. Obviously, compound A2 has the lowest HOMO/ LUMO energy while compound F1 has the highest values of HOMO/LUMO energy. On the other hand, compound B2 has the highest \u0394E LUMO-HOMO (6.04 eV) while compound C3 has the smallest \u0394E LUMO-HOMO (4.50 eV). It indicates that compound C3 will be more chemical reactive compared to compound B2. Figure 1 displays the variation trends of E HOMO , E LUMO and \u0394E LUMO-HOMO of the title compounds. For the derivatives with the same bridges and different substituents, it is seen that series 2 have the lowest E HOMO and E LUMO while series 1 possess the highest values (except for compounds B1 and B2). This is because the electron-withdrawing capacity of -NF 2 group is more stronger than that of \u00c0 N 3 group. Compared to series 3 and 4, value of E HOMO were found to be different from each other while values of E LUMO were very close to each other. It indicates that the influence of different positions of the substituent groups on E HOMO was apparent and the variation trend of E HOMO was more obvious than E LUMO . In view of the \u0394E LUMO-HOMO , the variation trends of \u0394E LUMO-HOMO of series B and E were more evident compared to series A, C, D and F which suggests that the",

In this study, we considered a number of radicals from smallest diatomic anion radicals such as superoxide anion radical to one-electron oxidized DNA related base radicals that show the SOMO is energetically lower than one or more doubly occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) (SOMO-HOMO level inversion). The electronic configurations are calculated employing the B3LYP/6-31++G** method, with the inclusion of aqueous phase via the integral equation formalism of the polarized continuum model solvation model. From the extensive study of the electronic configurations of radicals produced by one-electron oxidation or reduction of natural-DNA bases, bromine-, sulfur-, selenium-, and aza-substituted DNA bases, as well as 20 diatomic molecules, we highlight the following important findings: (i) SOMO-HOMO level inversion is a common phenomenon in radical species. (ii) The more localized spin density in \u03c3-orbital on a single atom (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, or selenium), the greater the gap between HOMO and SOMO. (iii) In species with SOMO-HOMO level inversion, one-electron oxidation takes place from HOMO not from the SOMO, which produces a molecule in its triplet ground state. Oxidation of aqueous superoxide anion producing triplet molecular oxygen is one example of many. (iv) These results are for conventional radicals and in contrast with those reported for distonic radical anions in which SOMO-HOMO gaps are smaller for more localized radicals and the orbital inversions vanish in water.

The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be a pivotal determinant to find a relationship between a class of drug's activity and their electronic configuration, as reported by Snyder et al. [80].

While Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is related to ionization potential, and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, average energy values for HOMO and LUMO are connected to electronegativity (Prasad and Ojha, 2017). HOMO and LUMO of the molecule were plotted using the same level theory. These Frontier Molecular Orbitals  (FMOs) and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be seen in Fig. 10. While HOMO orbital is mainly localized on 3-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one molecule group, LUMO orbital is mainly localized on diethyl 2-(2-acetylhydrazono)malonate group.

The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev.

It is a popular quantum mechanical descriptor for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (Zhou and Parr, 1990). They play a significant role in governing a wide range of chemical interactions. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of the four monomers are evaluated and listed in Figure 2. The OCT compounds are alpha molecular orbital level (32) and alpha molecular orbital level (33), which depend on the HOMO-LUMO gap, respectively. The energy values of the HOMO (32) orbital and LUMO (33) orbital were laying at an energy value of -8.53 and -0.02 eV, respectively. The detailed data can be found in Supplementary Table S1. In comparing these HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of different compounds, the ABE shows the highest value of 201.25 kcal/mol. The higher HOMO-LUMO energy gap implies the kinetic energy is higher and has high chemical reactivity (Saranya et al., 2018). The result indicates that the allyl ether monomers are more highly reactive than the allyl analog.\n\nThe BDE of C-H bonds in the donors is the key to hydrogen transfer (Zhou et al., 2016). As can be seen from the data in Figure 3, we found that ACE and ABE monomers have the lower BDE value at 78.67 and 79.42 kcal/mol, indicating two C-H bonds are more easily broken than others. The difference between the allyl and allyl ether was about 5 kcal/mol,\n\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nValues for HOMO and LUMO of the OCT, ABE, CYC, and ACE at the M06-2X/6-311++g(d,p) level (Unit: kcal/mol).\n\n\nFIGURE 3",

To elucidate the substitution effect of the chlorine atom on the HOMO of pyridine, we obtained one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analysed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectra of 2-CP having 35Cl or 37Cl to analyse the isotope effect on the vibrational mode. Based on the 0-0 band in the MATI spectrum of 2-CP having 35Cl, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined to be 9.4743 \u00b1 0.0005 eV (76\u2009415 \u00b1 4 cm-1) with a similar value for 37Cl, which is much lower but more accurate than the vertical value of 9.63 eV determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the MATI spectrum, which was affected by the geometrical change with respect to the neutral geometry upon ionization, could be analysed by Franck-Condon fitting and spectral correlation between the two isotopomers. Notably, we observed the appearance of the out-of-plane ring bending modes resulting from ring distortion, unlike in pyridine.

The HOMO is occupied by electrons and has the highest energy level, making it an electron donor, while the LUMO is unoccupied and has the lowest energy level, allowing it to accept electrons, making it an electron acceptor. These FMOs are crucial in determining how ligands interact with their receptors. By providing qualitative information on the susceptibility of electrons in the HOMO to transfer to the LUMO, FMOs can aid in understanding the nature of these interactions. HOMO and LUMO are important quantum chemical parameters that determine the reactivity of molecules and are used to calculate various chemical reactivity descriptors.\n\nAll necessary parameters to study the chemical reactivity of synthesized compounds including energy gap, kinetic stability, chemical so\ue09dness, chemical hardness (h), electronic chemical potential (m), electronegativity (c), electrophilicity index (u), and hydrophobicity coefficient (Log P) were calculated and listed in Table 4. Additionally, Fig. 14 shows the frontier molecular orbital HOMO and LUMO for the investigated compounds in gas phase.\n\nBased on the study, it appears that most of the compounds being analyzed have moderate lipophilicity with a Log P range of [\u22120.39 to 0.75]. However, one derivative, 5a, has the highest value of Log P at 0.85.\n\nIn terms of dipole moment, the range observed is [3.17-7.30], with compound 6a showing the highest value at 7.30. This is likely due to the presence of NO 2 and OH substituents on the aromatic ring.\n\nThe polarizability depends on how the susceptibility of the molecular system electron cloud is affected by the approaching of a charge. Molecules of large size are more polarizable compounds. It is worth noting that compound 1a is the smallest in size and has the least polarizability (165.36 bohr 3 ), however, 6a of the highest complexity is predicted to have the highest polarizability, 214.13 bohr 3 .",

Extrapolating to infinite hydration numbers we find that these energies approach a value of -6 eV. This limiting one-electron energy is within a margin of +/-1 eV independent of the character of the ion and is 4 eV lower compared to the estimate obtained for the HOMO energy of the ions in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions. We argue that this discrepancy must the attributed to a shift in the reference of the one-electron potential of the periodic solvent model.",

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

FMOs refer to the collective term of a molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap (i.e., the gap) between the HOMO and the LUMO reveals the charge transfer of electrons. The gap defines the first excited state, reflecting the dynamical stability and chemical reactivity of the molecule. Figure 11 shows the energy level diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C16, where the HOMO and LUMO are both distributed in the carboxyl and amido. The HOMO of the secondary orbitals is distributed in the carboxyl group, indicating the nucleophilic region, and the LUMO is located in the amido group, indicating the electrophilic region. Figure 12 shows the energy level diagrams of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C17, whose distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO on the functional groups is the same as that of 3C16. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C16 is 0.2858 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6803 eV. The energy gap of the front-line molecular orbitals for 3C17 is 0.2855 eV and the energy gap of the secondary orbitals is 0.6966 eV.

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6.

The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO in CMC are due to p-type orbitals localized to the Cu-N-C bonds. The difference on the frontier MOs may lead to a different redox reactivity.",

However, the effect of modifying the performance of g-C 3 N 4 is still under debate. In this communication, we show the size and functional group effects on the g-C 3 N 4 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that a molecule with six repeated g-C 3 N 4 units (g-C 3 N 4 -6) could be the smallest unit that converges to the limit of its HOMO-LUMO gap. Calculations of g-C 3 N 4 -6 with varying numbers of substituted C\u2261N, C=O, and O\u2212H functional groups show that C\u2261N and C=O could narrow down the HOMO-LUMO gap, while O\u2212H could slightly raise the gap.

As reported in Figure S62 (Supporting Information) LUMO + 1 energies are related by a linear relationship to LUMO energies for all R IPP_ BF 2 derivatives. Thus, HOMO-LUMO energy gap can be used in the studied correlations, since it describes also contributions from LUMO + 1. We chose \u03c3 p Hammett constants of the substituent R as the best descriptor of its electronic features. When correlated to \u03c3 p , HOMO and LUMO energies follow a linear trend, with the energy of both frontier orbitals decreasing in the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents (namely, with increasing \u03c3 p ). Worthy of note, irrespective of \u03c3 p (i. e., the electronic character of R), the HOMO/LUMO energy gap is maintained almost constant over the whole series ( Figure 6, Table 5), including NO2 IPP_BF 2 .

The FMO of a molecule is the \"frontier\" of an electron that helps to determine the energy difference between two orbitals HOMO and LUMO. HOMO is mainly an electron donor (nucleophilic) and LUMO is an electron acceptor (electrophilic) in nature and the interaction between electron donor and electron acceptor pair can dominate other chemical reactivity of a molecule [32]. During the electrophilic-nucleophilic reaction, electrons from the HOMO jump to the LUMO and produce an energy difference between two molecular orbitals. The energy difference between two molecular orbitals is known as the HOMO-LUMO gap, which can explain the photochemistry and the strength and stability of transition metal complexes of organic molecules. To understand the sensitivity of atoms toward electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks, the HOMO and LUMO energy were calculated by using the Schr\u00f6dinger Jaguar version 10.9 [27], and the energy difference between two molecular orbital HOMO-LUMO gaps was calculated from the following Equation (3).\n\u2206E (gap) = E LUMO \u2212 E HOMO(3)\nwhere, \u2206E is the HOMO-LUMO gaps, E LUMO is the lowest energy unoccupied molecular orbital energy, and E HOMO is the highest energy occupied molecular orbital energy.\n\n\nRe-Docking and Interaction Analysis\n\nGeometry optimized through the DFT-based QM method of selected three compounds has been retrieved and docked again to the same binding site of the MERS-COV S1-NTD.

These frontier molecular orbitals are known as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 4).  The electronic absorption relates to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and mainly described by one electron excitation from HOMO to LUMO [27]. Kinetic stability increases with the increase of the HOMO-LUMO gap. As a result, the removal of electrons from ground state HOMO to excited state LUMO requires more energy. Table 3 represents the values of orbital energies, along with the two global chemical descriptors, hardness, and softness, which are also calculated for all compounds. The highest softness was observed for the compound (9). Compound (9) also showed the lowest HOMO-LUMO gap (4.3552 eV) and hardness (2.1776eV), indicating the molecule is more reactive than other compounds, according to Hoque et al [28,29].

The introduction of carboxylic group in place of nitro 53, raise the HOMO and LUMO energies. It was seen that energy gap of the 52b is greater than the 52b. We observed decrease in energy gap by using solvent for 52a while solvent has no significant effect for 52b. Figure 14. The distribution patterns of the frontier molecular orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs) of 52a and 52b   In Table 30, the \u2206G inject , Oxidation potential, and |VRP| of the studied dyes were presented. The values of electron injection and electronic coupling constant for 52a are _ 0.86 and 0.43, respectively, while 52b are _ 1.16 and 0.58, respectively. Al-Sehemi et al. demonstrated that, (HOMOs) the highest occupied molecular orbitals and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) are delocalized and localized on throughout the backbone in 52b, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energies reduced from gas phase to solvent. Solvent plays important role towards elevating the dipole moment. In solvent, the wavelengths of maximum absorption are red shifted. Further improvement towards efficient sensitizers occur when we attach anchoring groups having strong anchoring ability along with elongating the bridge as revealed in this study [78]. As seen in Scheme 9, to achieve site selectivity at C7, using of the monodentate phosphine ligand SPhos proved crucial, giving the coveted item 55 a in great yield.\n\n\nThe regiodivergent palladium-catalysed C-H arylation of Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine\n\nThe HOMO orbital has critical electron density at the C3 position, and that this position has by far the highest \"electrophile affinity\" (E\u03b1) value (Figure 15a) [79], on the other hand, they focused the significantly greater acidity of the C7-H group as detected by comparing the computed relative energies for the removal of each of the protons by acetate (Figure 15b) [80].",

The NCN radical was monitored by laser-induced fluorescence with a dye laser at 329.01 nm.

The enthalpy of this charge transfer reaction is defined as the difference of ionization energies (E<subI</sub) between CN and CO.

This limiting one-electron energy is within a margin of +/-1 eV independent of the character of the ion and is 4 eV lower compared to the estimate obtained for the HOMO energy of the ions in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions.

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

From Table 1, it is found that the HOMO energy levels increased when \u2212NH 2 , \u2212N 3 , \u2212NHNO 2 , \u2212NHNH 2 , and \u2212C(NO 2 ) 3 groups were introduced compared to the solo HMX ring (HOMO: \u22128.53 eV, LUMO: \u22122.69 eV, HOMO\u2212LUMO gap: 5.84 eV). However, the number of carbonyl, \u2212N 3 , \u2212NF 2 , \u2212CH(NO 2 ) 2 , \u2212C(NO 2 ) 3 , \u2212NO 2 , and \u2212ONO 2 groups had a marginal effect on HOMO energy levels (A1, B2, B3, B6, B7, B8, and B9). The order of HOMO energy levels on energetic groups is as follows:\n\u2212NHNH 2 > \u2212C(NO 2 ) 3 > \u2212NH 2 > \u2212N 3 > \u2212NHNO 2 > \u2212NF 2 > \u2212ONO 2 > \u2212NO 2 > \u2212C\ue0c8O > \u2212CH(NO 2 ) 2 (A1, B1\u2212B9)",

Our measurements of the HHG spectrum of N2 molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization showed a maximum at the rotational half-revival. This feature indicates the influence of electrons occupying the orbital just below the N2 HOMO, referred to as the HOMO-1. Such observations of lower-lying orbitals are essential to understanding subfemtosecond/subangstrom electronic motion in laser-excited molecules.",

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity. As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV. Koopman's theorem is used to calculate molecular orbital energies, which allows closed-shell molecules to duplicate the molecule's reactivity. Based on the global reactivity characteristics, the molecule's calculated ionization potential, electron affinity, and electronegativity are 5.65, 0.91, and 3.74 eV. The chemical hardness is also another important molecular property that explains the resistance of the atoms in the molecule to either polarize or deform their electron density clouds, the value is 2.83 eV. Fig. 8 depicts the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, with blue and red color surface distributions indicating positive and negative locations in the molecular orbital wave function, respectively.

Boltzmann-type rotational distributions of CO correspond to temperatures 3520+/-110 (v=1) to 2300+/-610 K (v=6), with an average rotational energy of 23+/-2 kJ mol(-1). The average vibrational energy of CO is estimated to be 26+/-4 kJ mol(-1) according to observed vibrational populations of v=1-6 and that of v=0 predicted with a surprisal analysis. Combining the average internal energy of CO determined in this work and average translational energies of photofragments Cl and CO determined previously by Hemmi and Suits, we propose a four-body dissociation mechanism producing one pair of translationally rapid and internally excited CO and one pair of translationally rapid Cl, each with similar energies, to account for the energy balance. Formation of translationally slow ClCO, Cl, and CO reported previously by Hemmi and Suits might be rationalized with a second channel involving emission of electronically excited intermediates. We observed no emission of ClCO near 1880 cm(-1), indicating that surviving ClCO has little vibrational excitation in the C-O stretching mode.",

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

From the remaining electronic transitions, the even ones at higher energies (#2, 4, etc.) are prohibited (i.e. they have zero intensity), while the odd ones are allowed.\n\nThe decreasing intensity of the sequence of odd-number transitions is clearly seen in Fig. 2.",

The binding energy of the Au atom, the gold to ligand distances, and the dipole moments of the free molecules and the molecules bound to the gold atom are reported in Table I. The results for CNH and CNCH 3 are very similar. For comparison, results for CO and NH 3 are also shown. The first step of relaxation allows only configurations with axial symmetry. The axial CO and CNH molecules are very similar in their electronic structure. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is the lone pair on the C and there is a doubly degenerate \u03c0 bond between C and the N or O. For NH 3 , the N lone pair is the HOMO, but there are no \u03c0 bonds. The \u03c3 part of the interaction in all three is due to coupling of the lone pair orbital on the ligand to the d z 2 \u2212r 2 and s states on the Au. This results in partial transfer of electron density onto the Au atom. Because the Au s state is half filled, the frontier, antibonding \u03c3 state in the complex is also half filled. The initial ligand lone pair orbital energy is highest for NH 3 , comparable to the Au s state, and successively lower for CNCH 3 , CNH and lowest for CO.",

To elucidate the substitution effect of the chlorine atom on the HOMO of pyridine, we obtained one-photon vacuum ultraviolet mass-analysed threshold ionization (VUV-MATI) spectra of 2-CP having 35Cl or 37Cl to analyse the isotope effect on the vibrational mode. Based on the 0-0 band in the MATI spectrum of 2-CP having 35Cl, the adiabatic ionization energy was determined to be 9.4743 \u00b1 0.0005 eV (76\u2009415 \u00b1 4 cm-1) with a similar value for 37Cl, which is much lower but more accurate than the vertical value of 9.63 eV determined by photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the MATI spectrum, which was affected by the geometrical change with respect to the neutral geometry upon ionization, could be analysed by Franck-Condon fitting and spectral correlation between the two isotopomers. Notably, we observed the appearance of the out-of-plane ring bending modes resulting from ring distortion, unlike in pyridine. Furthermore, natural bond orbital analysis led to the conclusion that the warped structure with C1 symmetry of cationic 2-CP is induced by the electron removal from the HOMO consisting of the \u03c0 orbital in the pyridine ring, which is stabilized by hyperconjugation with the lone-pair p orbitals of a nitrogen and chlorine atom.",

Non-bonding orbitals are the equivalent in molecular orbital theory of the lone pairs in Lewis structures.

Here, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is the (N/2) th orbital, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is the (N/2 + 1) th orbital, where N is the number of electrons in n-cyclacene.

While Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is related to ionization potential, and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity. The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020). Additionally, average energy values for HOMO and LUMO are connected to electronegativity (Prasad and Ojha, 2017). HOMO and LUMO of the molecule were plotted using the same level theory. These Frontier Molecular Orbitals  (FMOs) and the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO can be seen in Fig. 10.

Here we compute the fundamental vibrational frequencies by applying second-order vibrational perturbation theory to the complete quartic force field computed at the all-electron (AE) coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples level [CCSD(T)] with the correlation-consistent, polarized core-valence quadruple-zeta (cc-pCVQZ) basis set, which has tight functions to correctly describe core correlation. The AE-CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ geometric parameters are r(e)(N-C)=1.1623 A, r(e)(C-C)=1.4370 A, r(e)(C-O)=1.1758 A, theta(e)(N-C-C)=168.55 degrees , and theta(e)(C-C-O)=132.22 degrees . Our CCSD(T)/cc-pCVQZ values of the characteristic stretching frequencies nu(1) and nu(2) are 2171 and 1898 cm(-1), respectively, in stark contrast to the experimentally derived values of 2093 and 1774 cm(-1). Finally, focal-point extrapolations using correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pVXZ (X=D,T,Q,5,6) and electron correlation treatments as extensive as full coupled cluster singles, doubles, and triples (CCSDT) with perturbative accounting of quadruple excitations [CCSDT(Q)] determine the vibrationless barrier to linearity of NCCO and the dissociation energy (D(0)) of NCCO--&gt;NC+CO to be 8.4 and 26.5 kcal mol(-1), respectively. Using our precisely determined dissociation energy, we recommend a new 0 K enthalpy of formation for NCCO of 50.9+/-0.3 kcal mol(-1).",

The CN radical was produced from the photolysis of BrCN at 193 nm, and the NCO radical from the CN + O(2) reaction.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory.

The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The high value of the energy gap obtained will not facilitate the movement of electrons, so the molecule is associated with low chemical reactivity (high kinetic stability). The electrophilicity index measures the stabilization of energy when the system acquires an additional electronic charge, so ahigh value favors its electrophilic behavior [30]. It is worth noting that the chemical potential is negative, which means that our crystal is stable, biologically active and does not spontaneously decompose into its elements [31]. Figure 8 gives the HOMO and LUMO representation of the HTN compound; the HOMO orbitals are concentrated on the anionic part and the NH 3 groups of histaminium, whereas the LUMO orbitals are mainly located on the nitrate anion.

Therefore, the DFT calculation allows us to explore the most important information on reactivity as well as site selectivity. As we know, HOMO energy is closely tied to ionization energy, whereas LUMO energy is directly associated with electron affinity. The stability of the molecule can be confirmed from the bandgap energy, the value is 5.65 eV.

We have obtained the ground-state structures for C(60-n)Nn for n = 1-12, which show higher stability with a single nitrogen in a pentagon and two nonadjacent nitrogen atoms in a hexagon. Nitrogen doping leads to structural deformation, with the diameter showing variation from (7.14 - 0.24) to (7.14 + 0.10) A. The average diameter of C(60-n)Nn shows a small decrease for n &gt; or = 5, with a minimum value of 7.06 A for n = 12. The change in the average diameter signifies the volume contraction, which is also maximum for C48N12. The binding energy per atom is found to decrease as a function of the number of N atoms. The HOMO-LUMO gap is found to decrease with an increase in substitutional nitrogen atoms; however, no systematic pattern could be observed. The Mulliken charge analysis performed on all optimized geometries shows a charge transfer of -0.3 to -0.45 (or 0.3-0.45 electrons) from nitrogen to carbon atoms, resulting in nitrogen atoms behaving as electrophilic sites. The harmonic vibrational frequency analysis shows the absence of any imaginary mode. The vibrational frequencies are found to decrease with an increase in the number of nitrogen atoms in C(60-n)Nn. The results obtained are consistent with available theoretical and experimental results.",

The measurements were conducted over a pressure range of 2.8-4.3 Torr of CH4 and at a temperature of 293 +/- 2 K. The radicals were generated by the 248-nm photolysis of ClNCO in a large excess of CH4. The subsequent rapid reaction, Cl + CH4, generated the CH3 radical. The rate constant for the Cl + CH4 reaction was measured to be (9.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(-14) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1), where the uncertainty is the scatter of one standard deviation in the data. The progress of the reaction was followed by time-resolved infrared absorption spectroscopy on single rovibrational transitions from the ground vibrational level. Multiple species were detected in these experiments, including NCO, CH3, HCl, C2H6, HCN, HNC, NH, and HNCO. Temporal concentration profiles of the observed species were simulated using a kinetic model, and rate constants were determined by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals between experimental observations and model calculations. Both HCN and HNC seem to be minor products (&lt;0.3% each) of the NCO + CH3 reaction. The peak concentrations of NH and HNCO were small, accounting for &lt;1% of the initial NCO concentration; however, their temporal profiles could not be fit by the model kinetics. The observed C2H6 temporal profile always peaked at significantly higher concentrations than the model predictions, and several reaction models were constructed to help explain these observations. The most likely product channel seems to be the recombination channels, producing CH3NCO and CH3OCN.",

NCN radicals and H atoms were generated by the thermal decomposition of NCN3 and C2H5I, respectively. NCN concentration-time profiles were measured by sensitive narrow-line-width laser absorption at a wavelength of \u03bb = 329.1302 nm.

The high value of the energy gap obtained will not facilitate the movement of electrons, so the molecule is associated with low chemical reactivity (high kinetic stability). The electrophilicity index measures the stabilization of energy when the system acquires an additional electronic charge, so ahigh value favors its electrophilic behavior [30]. It is worth noting that the chemical potential is negative, which means that our crystal is stable, biologically active and does not spontaneously decompose into its elements [31]. Figure 8 gives the HOMO and LUMO representation of the HTN compound; the HOMO orbitals are concentrated on the anionic part and the NH3 groups of histaminium, whereas the LUMO orbitals are mainly located on the nitrate anion. It can be deduced that the nitrate anion can act both as an electron donor and acceptor, while histaminium only acts as an electron donor. The comparison between the gap energy calculated for the HOMO, LUMO molecular boundaries (Eg = 3.59 eV) with that evaluated by extrapolation in UV spectroscopy (Eg = 3.80 eV) shows that the two methods give close energy values, which means that there is good agreement between the two types of calculations.

Our findings agree with those of Ref. [21], where the LUMO wavefunction is localized in atoms C8, C6, C2, N3, and N7. The only difference from our findings is the existence of a relatively higher probability in atom N7. In both results the lowest probabilities appear in the same atoms.

However, other ab initio calculations [63] give the ionization energy between 9.4-9.7 eV, which is in worse agreement with the experimental data (a deviation of 0.2-0.7 eV).\n\nAccording to our calculations the HOMO wavefunction of thymine (cf.

The CH(3)O (X (2)E) photoproducts were probed by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) on the A (2)A(1)-X (2)E transition under both nascent and jet-cooled conditions. The 3 and 3 bands originating from the vibrationless and C-O stretch (nu(3)) levels, respectively, were characterized to obtain the internal energy distribution of the CH(3)O products. Only a small fraction of the CH(3)O products (&lt; or =10%) were produced with one quantum of C-O stretch excitation as determined from the relative intensities of the bands in combination with transition probabilities derived from dispersed fluorescence measurements and/or calculated Franck-Condon factors. The CH(3)O products also had minimal rotational excitation: those produced in the ground vibrational state had a rotational temperature of 238 +/- 7 K, corresponding to less than 1% of the available energy. Products with C-O stretch excitation were found to have a higher rotational temperature, but still a small fraction of the total energy. Combining the CH(3)O internal energy findings with previous photofragment translational energy measurements [X. Yang, P. Felder and J. R. Huber, J. Phys. Chem., 1993, 97, 10903] indicates that most of the available energy is deposited in the NO(2) fragment. This is verified through dispersed fluorescence measurements which show that the NO(2) fragment is produced electronically excited with internal energies extending to the NO + O dissociation limit. Ab initio calculations confirm that the dominant initial excitation is strongly localized on the NO(2) moiety. The calculations are also used to reveal the forces that give rise to internal excitation of the CH(3)O fragment upon electronic excitation.",

We chose this computationally demanding method as it was found to perform very well for \u03c0!\u03c0* excitations and charge-transfer states. [47,48] The lowest energy transition (1 1 A!1 1 B 3 ) to S 1 is computed to be at 426 nm with a very large oscillator strength (f = 1.373). The 1 1 B 2 (415 nm) and 1 1 B 1 (393 nm) states correspond to S 2 and S 3 , respectively, and transitions to these states have very small oscillator strengths (f = 0.026 and 0.002, respectively). Hence, the absorption band observed at \u03bb max = 446 nm is assigned to arise from the S 0 !S 1 transition that is dominated (80 %) by an electronic excitation of one electron from HOMO to LUMO (Figure 3c). The HOMO is distributed over the entire molecule with large coefficients on the NBN subunits, while the LUMO is primarily located on the central [2.2]PCP core. This suggests that the electronic transition has some charge transfer character and shows that the electronic interaction of NBN and PCP subunits results in a strong broad band observed in the absorption spectrum that is absent for either building block.",

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

The determination of the correlation (R 2 ) for HOMO between PM7 and DFT was 0.78 using a random subset of 84 molecules from the validation data set, while our B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6 obtained a determination of coefficient, calculated between PM6 and DFT, ranging from 0.877 to 0.907.For LUMO, their calculation yielded 0.895, whereas B3LYP/6-31G*//PM6 determined the coefficient, calculated between PM6 and DFT, ranging from 0.821 to 0.905.

Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35].

Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring.

Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

It should be remarked that although the spectra are obtained on molecules surrounded by iodine atoms, we have previously shown by systematically comparing molecules with and without surrounding halogens that their presence has no effect on the HOMO\u2212LUMO gap values nor on the density of states distributions of molecular orbitals and only causes a minor (rigid) energy shift of occupied and unoccupied states. 47,48 As \u03c0-conjugation extends, the gap shrinks: the largest was found for monomer 2 (2.25 eV) but decreased to 1.45 eV for the fused dimer derivatives 3, 4, and 5. Intriguingly, 6 displayed a much smaller gap of 0.65 eV, which supports that 6 is kinetically but not thermodynamically preferred\ufffdlarger gaps are associated with more stable structures.\n\nThe HOMO\u2212LUMO gap reduction to less than half, from 3\u22125 to 6, is surprising since 6 has the same extent of \u03c0conjugation as the other fused products.

Its value is usually located between the fundamental gap (difference between ionization potential and electron affinity) and the optical gap. In addition, HOMO-LUMO gap can be related to a bulk material band gap or transport gap, which is usually much smaller than fundamental gap.

HOMO -LUMO energy\n\nThe fundamental importance of HOMO and LUMO understands the chemical stability and reactivity of many organic molecules. The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.   [21]. The HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the entire molecule. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV. This smaller energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the eventual charge transfer occurs within the molecule, which influences its high polarizability and biological activities.\n\n\nE.

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO in CMC are due to p-type orbitals localized to the Cu-N-C bonds. The difference on the frontier MOs may lead to a different redox reactivity.",

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%). It is inferable from the low Eg \n\n\nExcitation studies\n\nThe first five excitations of the studied compound were studied in acetone, ethanol, water, and also in gas phase (no solvent) in order to understand the various interactions between molecular orbitals in its system at excited state.",

These frontier molecular orbitals are known as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) (Fig. 4).  The electronic absorption relates to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and mainly described by one electron excitation from HOMO to LUMO [27]. Kinetic stability increases with the increase of the HOMO-LUMO gap. As a result, the removal of electrons from ground state HOMO to excited state LUMO requires more energy. Table 3 represents the values of orbital energies, along with the two global chemical descriptors, hardness, and softness, which are also calculated for all compounds. The highest softness was observed for the compound (9). Compound (9) also showed the lowest HOMO-LUMO gap (4.3552 eV) and hardness (2.1776eV), indicating the molecule is more reactive than other compounds, according to Hoque et al [28,29]. On the other hand, compound (3) showed the highest HOMO-LUMO gap (6.8730 eV) which less than our parent compound MGP (1) (7.5679 eV) which indicates that ester (3) closely stable as parent compound (1). Fig. 5 represents the density of states (DOS) plot for the highest and lowest energy gap of the modified derivatives. In Fig. 4, the LUMO diagram of the compound (3) showed that the electron was localized at the modified acylating group regions only, while the HOMO diagram showed that the electron was localized on the upper part of both the monosaccharide ring and acyl substituents.  -------------------------------------------------- \n\n\nSIFT DESK\n\n\nMolecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) Analysis",

S 1 presents an extended electron spatial distribution far from the nuclei due to the promotion of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO orbital, having a Rydberg character.Because of this particular electronic structure, the electron can be considered as effectively detached and some characteristics of excited Rydberg states converge to those of the related cation, in particular when describing the reactivity of the excited states (Lipsky 1981).To verify this assumption, we compared the computed relaxed geometries of neutral C 6 H 14 in the ground state S 0 , cation C 6 H 14 + in the ground state S 0 and neutral C 6 H 14 in the S 1 excited state (for simplicity, in the following we will refer to them as S 0 -neutral, S 0 -cation and S 1 -neutral, respectively).",

In the ground state S 0 , the CAAC group is relatively electron deficient, while the amide is electron rich, creating a ground-state electrostatic dipole moment of order 15 D aligned along the C-Au-N axis, hereafter taken as the z-axis of the molecule. [14] This large ground-state dipole is unusual for organic donor-acceptortype emitters, with important implications for the manipulation of emission energy (vide infra). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CMA1, calculated by density functional theory (DFT) utilizing the hybrid MN15 functional with the def2-TZVP basis set are presented in Figure 1b. The HOMO resides primarily on the amide, the LUMO on the carbene. Of order 3.0/11.4% of the electron density in the HOMO/LUMO resides on the metal, with largest contributions from the 5d yz /5p y atomic orbitals, respectively, where the carbazole is taken to lie in the x-z plane. Excitation from S 0 to S 1 is dominated by a HOMO-LUMO transition (natural transition orbitals comprise 98% HOMO-LUMO), which spans the metal bridge and has significant charge-transfer (CT) character, shifting electron density back from the amide to the carbene group. This reduces the electrostatic dipole to \u22485 D and reverses its sign. [4,20] In addition to direct absorption to the singlet CT state, optical absorption spectra of CMA1 show features related to ligandcentered excitations of the carbene and amide groups ( Figure S1, Supporting Information). For CMA1, the photo excited CT singlet crosses to the triplet manifold within around 5 ps, with subsequent unstructured emission on sub-microsecond time scales.

The energy gap between HOMO and LUMO is related to charge transfer in molecules (Nataraj et al., 2012) and identifies the chemical stabilities of molecules (Gilman, 2007). Furthermore, a low energy gap indicates high biological activity due to transferring electrons efficiently from HOMO (Wu et al., 2020).

In the context of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) materials, the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital energy (HOMO) minus the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital energy (LUMO), or the HOMO-LUMO energy gap plays a crucial role in determining their optoelectronic properties. A narrower HOMO-LUMO energy gap promotes fluorescence emission, as excited molecules can readily undergo radiative decay. On the other hand, a wider HOMO-LUMO energy gap favors non-fluorescent",

These results are given in Table 3 and the representations are shown in Figure 3. The analysis of wave functions indicate that the absorption of electron correspond to the transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). When using PM3 method, the HOMO is located over the chlorine atoms, and shows that in the coordination sphere, the two Cl are covalently link to copper atom and two supplementary Cl (from further molecules) realize coordinating bonds giving the external sphere for this complex. By contrast in LUMO, N 8,hist coordinates the Cu and the charge is delocalized over Cl 2 Cu-N(imidazole) atom group. So, the gap is 6.884 ev. In this case, the reaction site is located on the histamine unit (Table 1). So, the large gap obtained by PM3 implies high stability and low chemical reactivity of Cu(Hist)Cl 2 .

The HOMO energy signifies the donating ability while the LUMO energy is the accepting characteristics of the studied compound, thereby, necessitating electronic charge transfer from the HOMO to the LUMO. Furthermore, the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO is known as energy gap (E g ). Based on the FMO theory, the reactivity and stability of compounds would be determined by the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO of such compounds, hence, compounds with small and larger values of energy gap depicts a higher and lower reactivity and stability respectively [35]. This is true because electronic charge mobility between the HOMO and LUMO is paramount in a species with lower energy gap and vice versa for species with larger energy gap.

The ability of molecules with respect to electron donation or electron affinity can be determined using HOMO or LUMO energy values. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) usually indicates that the molecule is a good electron donor, and characterizes the susceptibility of the molecule to attack by electrophiles. The energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is related to electron affinity and describes the sensitivity of molecules toward nucleophile attack. The HOMO-LUMO gap (H-L), calculated as the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals, is an important index of stability and chemical reactivity.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

In HOMO the main electronic transition is occurred at C=C bonds of all the rings, S atom of the rings R2 and carbonyl group (in small amounts), while in LUMO the charge density is mainly accumulated at CC bond in rings.The calculated frontier orbital energies, absorption wavelengths (\u03bb max ), oscillator strengths (f), excitation energies (E) and dipole moments (\u00b5) for gas phase and benzene solvent environment (integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model, IEF-PCM) using the TD-DFT/6-31G method are illustrated in Table 1.This electronic absorption corresponds to the transition from the ground to the first excited state and is mainly described by one electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.The first alloweddipole transition in the gas phase was calculated about 278 nm with oscillator strength 0.0549.The next transitions were calculated about 252, 244 and 221 nm with oscillator strengths 0.0537, 0.0283 and 0.0152, respectively.The transitions \u03c0\u2192\u03c0* are the main observed transitions.\n\n\nVibrational assignment",

The order of energy gap between the two molecules is 10 (2.69 eV) > 11 (2.59 eV), respectively. The comparison between the two dyes and semiconductors shows that the two molecules can achieve effective charge separation and electron injection. The overall performance of the molecule 11 tends to be more planar, resulting in a smaller energy gap. This effect is better observed in the solvent due to dye molecules' interaction with the solvent, which results in a red-shifted absorption spectrum.  Figure 3 shows the molecular energy level diagram, including dyes and semiconductors, and dye sensitizers are higher than the CB (\u22124.0 eV) surface, ensuring the effective injection of electrons. Compared with experimental molecule TPCTh and TPCRh, Dye 10 and Dye 11 have a higher LUMO energy level, which is very beneficial for electron injection. Meanwhile, these dyes' HOMO energy level is lower than that of redox potential I\u00af/I 3\u00afe lectrolyte (\u22124.8 eV). Thus, these electron-lost sensitizers can receive electrons from the redox couple. Notably, the HOMO energy values of TPCTh and TPCRh are significantly higher than those of molecules 10 and 11, which can indicate that Dyes 10 and 11 are comfortable to obtain electrons and regenerate dyes. From the viewpoint of energy levels of Dyes 10 and 11, they have the potential possibility to use in DSSC S because of the energy-level matching.",

The l(B1u(HOMO--&gt;LUMO)) values are much larger than the l(LUMO) and l(HOMO) values in fluoroacenes. Furthermore, the Coulomb pseudopotential mu* values for the excited electronic states are estimated to be smaller than those for the monoanions and cations. The complete phase patterns difference between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) is the main reason why the electron-phonon coupling constants and the mu* values are larger and smaller, respectively, in the photoinduced excited electronic states than in the monoanions and cations. The possible electron pairing and Bose-Einstein condensation in the excited electronic states of fluoroacenes are discussed. Because of larger electron-phonon coupling constants and smaller mu* values in the excited electronic states than in the charged states, the conditions under which the electron-electron interactions become attractive can be more easily realized, in principle, in the excited electronic states than in the charged states in fluoroacenes.

The bond angle equally gives information on the distribution   The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are the two grand parameters for which the global indices of reactivity are derived. 48 The change in energy between the HOMO and LUMO can be referred to as HOMO\u2212LUMO energy gap, which is the lowest energy electronic excitation possible in a molecule. 49 When the mobility of the \u03c0 electrons is greater in large conjugated \u03c0 orbital systems, the energy distribution tends to be higher throughout the molecule. Fukui was the first to discover the critical role of the HOMO and LUMO in governing chemical reactions. The energy gap determines the kinetic stability and bioactivity of a molecule. 50,51 The larger energy gap indicates low chemical reactivity, and the smaller energy gap exhibits high reactivity. Hence, the smaller the energy difference, the greater the reactivity and the lesser the stability of a complex. 51 The energy of the HOMO and LUMO and their energy difference were computed to explore the chemical reactivity and stability and to estimate the quantum chemical descriptors of the rhenium complexes, respectively.

Its value is usually located between the fundamental gap (difference between ionization potential and electron affinity) and the optical gap. In addition, HOMO-LUMO gap can be related to a bulk material band gap or transport gap, which is usually much smaller than fundamental gap.

Disclosed herein is a novel strategy to decrease both LUMO and HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers by about 0.6\u2005eV through replacement of a C-C unit by a B\u2190N unit. The replacement makes the resulting polymer transform from an electron donor into an electron acceptor, and is proven by fluorescence quenching experiments and the photovoltaic response. This work not only provides an effective approach to tune the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers, but also uses organic boron chemistry as a new toolbox to develop conjugated polymers with high electron affinity for polymer optoelectronic devices.",

Clearly, lonchocarpol A, broussonol E, and diplacol demonstrated an intermolecular charge transfer as they excited from the ground state (S0) to the first excitation state. Interestingly, the LUMO energy is in the following order: lochocarpol A < dexamethasone < diplacol < broussonol E. The LUMO energy suggests that lonchocarpol A and dexamethasone are more susceptible to accepting electronic density because a lower energy molecular orbital will describe the additional electron.

The frontier molecular orbital diagrams and H\u2212L for 1-3 are shown in Figure 2. Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value. This agrees well with previous work (Wei et al., 2019).",

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO in CMC are due to p-type orbitals localized to the Cu-N-C bonds. The difference on the frontier MOs may lead to a different redox reactivity.",

FMOs refer to the collective term of a molecule's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the energy gap (i.e., the gap) between the HOMO and the LUMO reveals the charge transfer of electrons. The gap defines the first excited state, reflecting the dynamical stability and chemical reactivity of the molecule. Figure 11 shows the energy level diagram of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C16, where the HOMO and LUMO are both distributed in the carboxyl and amido. The HOMO of the secondary orbitals is distributed in the carboxyl group, indicating the nucleophilic region, and the LUMO is located in the amido group, indicating the electrophilic region. Figure 12 shows the energy level diagrams of the frontier molecular orbitals and secondary orbitals for 3C17, whose distribution of the HOMO and the LUMO on the functional groups is the same as that of 3C16.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory.

The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

However, the effect of modifying the performance of g-C 3 N 4 is still under debate. In this communication, we show the size and functional group effects on the g-C 3 N 4 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that a molecule with six repeated g-C 3 N 4 units (g-C 3 N 4 -6) could be the smallest unit that converges to the limit of its HOMO-LUMO gap. Calculations of g-C 3 N 4 -6 with varying numbers of substituted C\u2261N, C=O, and O\u2212H functional groups show that C\u2261N and C=O could narrow down the HOMO-LUMO gap, while O\u2212H could slightly raise the gap. This study shows that the change of substituents could tune the band gap of g-C 3 N 4 , suggesting that rationally modifying the substituent at the edge of g-C 3 N 4 -based materials could help to significantly increase the photocatalytic properties of a metal-free g-C 3 N 4 .\n\nIntroduction",

Extrapolating to infinite hydration numbers we find that these energies approach a value of -6 eV. This limiting one-electron energy is within a margin of +/-1 eV independent of the character of the ion and is 4 eV lower compared to the estimate obtained for the HOMO energy of the ions in aqueous solution under periodic boundary conditions. We argue that this discrepancy must the attributed to a shift in the reference of the one-electron potential of the periodic solvent model.",

Our first-principles calculations reveal that the HOMO energies of CNTs and graphene can both be raised by negatively charging, and that the rate of increase of the HOMO energy of a CNT is much greater and faster than that of graphene with the same number of C atoms. This discriminative modulation holds true regardless of the number of C atoms and the CNT type, and so is universal. This work provides a new opportunity to develop all-carbon devices with CNTs and graphene as different functional elements. ",

Our measurements of the HHG spectrum of N2 molecules aligned perpendicular to the laser polarization showed a maximum at the rotational half-revival. This feature indicates the influence of electrons occupying the orbital just below the N2 HOMO, referred to as the HOMO-1.

HOMO -LUMO energy\n\nThe fundamental importance of HOMO and LUMO understands the chemical stability and reactivity of many organic molecules. The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.   [21]. The HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the entire molecule. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV. This smaller energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the eventual charge transfer occurs within the molecule, which influences its high polarizability and biological activities.\n\n\nE.

Similar to PTCDA on Ag (111), it also features a LUMO peak at E F , as evidenced in UPS measurements [140][141][142] . We relax the NTCDA-Ag (111)  Ag (111) and a 4 \u00d7 4 surface unit cell as the substrate.\n\nThe level alignment calculations are carried out using a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 k-mesh (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 for the Fock exchange contribution). From our tuning, the optimal \u03b3 for the gasphase molecule is 0.19 bohr \u22121 , according to Eq. (3), and its HOMO energy is -9.7 eV. For Ag (111), the imageplane position is at 1.0\u00c5 above the surface, as determined above. The average distance between the optimized molecule and the surface is 2.88\u00c5, yielding an image-charge energy of 1.9 eV. This requires \u03b2 = \u22120.082 for the interface, according to Eq. (4). Fig. 8 shows our results and UPS data of Ref. 141. Compared to the experimental results, OT-RSH correctly depicts the pinned LUMO, the HOMO resonance, and places the HOMO-1 where UPS shows a shoulder, already around 3.5 eV below E F . PBE correctly shows a LUMO pinned at E F , describes the HOMO reasonably well, but misplaces the HOMO-1 resonance (by 0.7 eV) with respect to results from OT-RSH and experiment. This strongly suggests that OT-RSH is not only accurate for the frontier resonances, but actually maintains predictive power within several eVs from E F , 84,85 owing to the nonlocal exchange operator 143 . OT-RSH and PBE yield similar work function values (4.7 eV and 4.8 eV, respectively). Regarding the work function change, OT-RSH and PBE differ slightly more (by 0.4 eV and have different signs) in this case. However, we are not aware of experimental data for the work function change in this case, and our results suggest this would be a measurement of interest.",

[21], since in both cases the HOMO wavefunction is distributed all over adenine and the lowest probabilities are found at the same atoms. Our results are also in agreement with the outcome of density functional theory calculations [81], where the \u03c0 HOMO wavefunction was found to be delocalized along adenine, with greater probabilities in atoms N7, N3, C6, C5, C8, and the lowest in atom N9, as well as with recent time-dependent density functional theory predictions [76], where the HOMO wavefunction is distributed all over the molecule except from atom N9.\n\nWe find the LUMO energy of adenine at \u22124.4 eV.

It must be mentioned here that, although it is generally accepted for all DNA bases that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap corresponds to the first \u03c0-\u03c0 * transition [45,48,49,54,57], in Ref. [77] the HOMO-LUMO gap of adenine is attributed to a n\u03c0 * transition, while in Refs. [75,76] the \u03c0-\u03c0 * and n-\u03c0 * transitions are predicted to be very close.",

In this section, we will explain the difference between the two nomenclatures. We use the abbreviation HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital), when we are discussing the gas-phase properties of the molecules. Whereas, if the molecule is in between two metal electrodes, i.e., in a metal-molecule-metal junction, we use the term HOPS (Highest Occupied \u03c0-State). The distinction arises because of the fact that in a metal-moleculemetal junction, the highest occupied energy level will be localized on the metal atoms. While, we are only interested in the energy level whose electron density is localized on the conjugated molecule. This is shown in Fig. S22. Figure S22: Explaining the nomenclature: A) When we discuss the gas-phase highest occupied molecular level, we use HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital). B) When we discuss the highest occupied \u03c0-molecular level in a metal-molecule-metal junction, we use HOPS (Highest Occupied \u03c0-State) to denote it.\n\n\nS-32\n\n\nHOMO HOPS\n\n\nA) In Gas-Phase B) In a Molecular Junction\n\n\nTwo-Barrier Model\n\nWe implemented a model that describes tunneling through a piece-wise constant double-barrier potential, similar to the model proposed in Reference S17.\n\n\nModel of piece-wise constant double barriers\n\nTo explain the evolution of the tunneling current with the length L T of the aromatic portion of the TnC4 molecules (n = 1, 2, 3, 4), we suggest a simple one-dimensional model as sketched in This model assumes that the holes are provided by the metal electrodes with an energy E close to E F (Regions 1 and 4 in Fig.S23). For convenience, E F = 0 so that V 1 = V 4 = 0. The holes are S-33 assumed to arrive from the left side (region 1). We are interested in the fraction of the incoming wavefunction that is transmitted into the second electrode (region 4).\n\nThe alkyl portion of the TnC4 molecules poses a first tunneling barrier of height V 2 (region 2).",

The CCSD(T) and the MP2 levels of theory were employed along with the series of correlation consistent basis sets extrapolated to the complete basis set (CBS) limit in the optimization of the geometrical parameters and computation of electronic energies. The relative stability, in kcal mol<sup-1</sup, at the CCSD(T)/CBS follows the trend: HSSeBr (0)\u00a0&gt;\u00a0HSeSBr (9.51)\u00a0&gt;\u00a0SSeHBr (24.02)\u00a0&gt;\u00a0SeSHBr (25.42). This order was observed in the previous study of the [H, S, Se, Cl] species. The structural parameters and vibrational frequencies of the [H, S, Se, Br] species are reported. This research work should be helpful to experimentalists in order to gain insights into these novel heteroatom molecules.

A systematic energy shift of the N(1s) to LUMO transition is found along a series of 3d metal octaethylporphyrins and explained by density functional theory.

The simplest way to calculate the excitation energy is by finding the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and is an excellent indicator of electronic transition absorption in the molecular systems. [42] The HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap for 2N1N molecule were calculated using B3LYP level with 6-31G** basis set. Owing to the HOMO-LUMO orbital interaction, LP-\u03c0* and LP-LP type interactions were observed in the title compound consistent with the molecular orbital theory. [43,44] The position of HOMO-LUMO plots was shown in Fig. 6. The calculated HOMO, LUMO energies, and the energy gap are shown below.\n\nHOMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 5:93eV LUMO energy \u00bc \u00c0 2:65eV HOMO \u00c0 LUMO energy gap \u00bc 3:27eV\n\nFor the title compound 2N1N, a total of 45 occupied orbitals and 185 virtual orbitals were observed. The molecular orbital analyses for the title compound 2N1N based on its optimized geometry indicate that the frontier molecular orbitals for the title compound are mainly composed of p-atomic orbitals. The electronic transitions are predominantly LP-LP transition for the title compound. Moreover, the HOMO-LUMO energy gap clearly explains the eventual charge transfer interaction taking place within the molecule. The HOMO was observed over the nitroso functional group attached to the naphthol ring. It is also observed from the electronic absorption spectra and also the LUMO of the title compound that the charge transfer is taking place in the compound from the nitroso group to the entire ring which shows that the LUMO spreads over the entire ring as observed from Fig. 6.\n\n\nNBO analysis",

The high electron affinity of F 4 TCNQ triggers a large static charge transfer from the substrate, and, more interestingly, hybridization with the substrate leads to a radical change of symmetry, shape and energy of frontier molecular orbitals. The Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) shifts below the Fermi energy, becoming the new Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (n-HOMO), whereas the n-LUMO is defined by a hybrid band with mixed \u03c0 * and \u03c3 * symmetries, localized at quinone rings and cyano groups, respectively. The presence of Bi influences the way the molecule contacts the substrate with the cyano group. The molecule/surface distance is closer and the bond more extended over substrate atoms in F 4 TCNQ/Ag(111), whereas in F 4 TCNQ/BiAg 2 /Ag(111) the distance is larger and the contact more localized on top of Bi. This does not significantly alter molecular levels, but it causes the respective absence or presence of optical excitations in F 4 TCNQ core-level spectra.\n\nIntroduction",

HOMO -LUMO energy\n\nThe fundamental importance of HOMO and LUMO understands the chemical stability and reactivity of many organic molecules. The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.   [21]. The HOMO and LUMO are delocalized over the entire molecule. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV. This smaller energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the eventual charge transfer occurs within the molecule, which influences its high polarizability and biological activities.\n\n\nE.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%). The penultimate orbital to HOMO (HOMO-1) is identified to be distributed around C19 (10.99%) and C10 (8.59) atoms, it is also from a p-orbital. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) and LUMO + 1 are part of the receiving end on electron transition. The LUMO is contributed basically by a p-orbital around N12 (22.18%) and N13 (22.37%), which are good electron accepting regions of the molecule. It was established that the LUMO + 1 exist on the p-orbitals C21 (16.7%).

Inspection of Figure 2 reveals that, for all molecules, both HOMO and LUMO spread over the whole \u03c0-conjugated backbones. Specifically, HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and exhibits bonding, whereas the LUMO is a \u03c0 * orbital with antibonding character. This type of distribution is beneficial for intramolecular charge transfer process. A larger HOMO-LUMO energy gap would hamper the optical excitation, which induces better stability. The HOMO-LUMO energy gaps are 1.35, 1.65, and 1.98 eV for 1, 2, and 3. Interestingly, the positive correlation between NICS (in absolute value) and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps can be observed, which is the molecule with the larger HOMO-LUMO gaps would have the larger absolute NICS value.

The large HOMO-LUMO gap of CMC is consistent with the observed short Cu-N distance. The MO levels and their shapes around the gap in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S5, where only a-spin orbitals are shown for simplicity, suggest that the electronic states of the two models are quite different. Compared with congested MOs in NMC, discrete MOs with different shapes are found around the gap in CMC. The frontier MOs from HOMO-4 to LUMO13 in NMC consist of s-type orbitals over the space extending to the ligands or surface Cu atoms. In contrast, the HOMO and LUMO in CMC are due to p-type orbitals localized to the Cu-N-C bonds. The difference on the frontier MOs may lead to a different redox reactivity.",

The energy gap between the HOMOs and LUMOs is the congested parameters in deciding molecular electrical transport properties assist in the measure of electron conductivity [19]. The HOMO energy illustrates the ability of electron donor unit, the LUMO illustrate the ability of the electron acceptor unit. HOMO and LUMO is related to the ionization potential and electron affinity. The energy difference between HOMO and LUMO energy is called as energy gap that is important stability for structure [20]. The total energy, HOMO and LUMO energies, the energy gap (\u2206E), the ionization potential (I), the electron affinity (A), the absolute electronegativity (\u03c7), the absolute hardness (\u03b7) and softness (S) for the CN4C molecule have been calculated at B3LYP/6-311++G(d,P) basis set (Fig. 2) and the result are given in Table 4.

The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy is -3.8030 eV and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy is -7.4815 eV. According to DFT calculation, the frontier orbital energy gap of CN4C is found to be 3.6785 eV. This smaller energy gap of HOMO-LUMO explains the eventual charge transfer occurs within the molecule, which influences its high polarizability and biological activities.\n\n\nE.

The excitation energies of the lowest singlet MLCT (metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer) states range between 12 630 and 17 580 cm(-)(1). They originate in the excitation of chromium d electrons to the lowest pi(bpy) orbital of b(2) local symmetry. Dipole transition moments calculated for individual MLCT transitions show that the only transition expected to contribute significantly to the intense absorption band in the visible spectral region is the a(1)A(1) --&gt; b(1)A(1) transition calculated at 17 580 cm(-)(1). This result agrees very well with the experimental spectra recorded in weakly solvating C(2)Cl(4), characterized by a band at 17 700 cm(-)(1). The low-energy emission band at 12 850 cm(-)(1) has been attributed to the lowest a(3)B(2) state calculated at 12 560 cm(-)(1). The next set of excited states corresponding to 3d --&gt; pi(bpy,a)()2 excitations range between 25 370 and 26 200 cm(-)(1) for the singlets and between 24 630 and 25 750 cm(-)(1) for the triplets. The singlet excited states corresponding to d --&gt; d excitations are calculated between 29 650 and 37 360 cm(-)(1). These results show that the intense absorption in the near-UV spectral region originates in strongly overlapping absorption bands due to closely spaced transitions into MLCT (a(2)) and dd excited states, respectively. The c(1)B(2) excited state corresponding to the 3d(xz)() --&gt; 3d(z)()()2 excitation, proposed as photoactive in the mechanism of the efficient CO loss under irradiation at 27 630 cm(-)(1), is calculated at 36 320 cm(-)(1) and is far too high to be directly populated in these photochemical studies. Its mixing with one or several low-lying (singlet) MLCT states at the early stage of the reaction path could be responsible for the observed primary reaction. A comparison between the excitation energies of the lowest singlet states of Cr(CO)(4)(bpy) and Cr(CO)(4)(dab) is reported.

This paper aims to solve this controversy. By using a different version of MRPT, the n-electron valence state perturbation theory method, the description provided by TD-DFT is confirmed: the lowest B(u) singlet state has a HOMO--&gt;LUMO nature and a large oscillator strength (HOMO refers to highest occupied molecular orbital and LUMO refers to lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), while the second B(u) singlet state has a mixed HOMO-1--&gt;LUMO and HOMO--&gt;LUMO+1 nature, has an oscillator strength almost vanishing, and is located at 0.6-0.7 eV higher than the first excited state.

From Fig. 4, Eg is 2.95 eV, which is relatively low [27][28][29][30][31][32], hence excitation from the HOMO to LUMO is easily feasible; this is a basic property of a reactive molecule. Also, the energy gap between HOMO-1 and LUMO + 1 orbitals was determined for a more explicit information about the studied molecule; we obtained Eg to be 4.94 eV. Also, the locations and distributions of these orbitals (HOMO-1, HOMO, LUMO and LUMO + 1) were determined abreast the pictorial representations in Fig. 4, in order to understand the orbital properties of the valence orbitals [28]. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is concentrated around C18, and it is basically from a p-type orbital on C18 (18.69%).

The calculation results indicate that the carbon and oxygen (in the ester group) come into being different large pi bonds with the benzene circles because of place blocking and conjugate effect. On this basis, the first excited state electronic transition energy was calculated by time-dependent density function theory. The calculated results show that the largest absorption spectra of the title compounds were obtained from the pi --&gt; pi* electron transition from the highest occupied molecular orbital to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. And lambda(max) was obtained in 370-384 nm, belonging to the UV absorption area. The computed results show that the lateral substitutent of 1,4-bis [(p-methoxyphenoxy) carbonyl] has little effects on molecular structure. Because of place blocking, the dihedral angle between benzene (1) and benzene (2) augments 3 degrees-4 degrees. The introduction of the lateral substitutents has effects on vibrational spectra. The results showed that with the introduction of hydroxy the difference between E(HOMO) and E(LUMO) of the compound becomes small. While lambda(max) becomes large. Meanwhile, the difference between E(HOMO) and E(LUMO) reduces by 0.120 9 eV with the introduction of fluorin. This causes the biggest absorption wavelength to red shift 14 nm.",

These compounds exhibit excellent thermal stabilities, with thermal decomposition temperatures exceeding 400 &amp;deg;C. From the fluorescent spectra in film, CzP-H, CzP-Me, and CzP-OMe showed UV to blue-violet emission, with peaks at 396 nm, 402 nm, and 392 nm, respectively. The <iE</i<sub00</sub energies of CzP-H, CzP-CN, CzP-Me, and CzP-OMe were 3.39 eV, 2.83 eV, 3.50 eV, and 3.35 eV, respectively. From the electrochemical measurements, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMOs) energy levels were &amp;minus;5.30 eV, &amp;minus;5.64 eV, &amp;minus;5.46 eV, and &amp;minus;5.24 eV for CzP-H, CzP-CN, CzP-Me, and CzP-OMe, respectively. Through calculations from HOMO energy levels and <iE</i<sub00</sub energies, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMOs) energy levels of CzP-H, CzP-CN, CzP-Me, and CzP-OMe were &amp;minus;1.91 eV, &amp;minus;2.81 eV, &amp;minus;1.96 eV, and &amp;minus;1.89 eV, respectively. Therefore, the introduction of different substitutes in phenyl cores would distinctly affect the photophysical properties. These results indicate that the prepared carbazole derivatives could be potential candidates for realizing ultraviolet or blue-violet emission.",
