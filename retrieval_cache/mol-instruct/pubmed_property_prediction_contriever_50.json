An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS.

Since the HOMO-LUMO and C-Co sigma-sigma MO gaps are significantly smaller in the MeCbl(II) compounds compared with MeCbl(III), a pseudo-Jahn Teller effect is possible. CASSCF calculations show that there is strong coupling between C-Co sigma-sigma MOs for the MeCbl(II) models leading to strong state mixing with significant total charge density transfer (approximately 0.4 e-), mainly from the C-Co sigma MO to C-Co sigma MO (approximately 0.3 e-). CASSCF(9:7) calculations show that the strong state mixing leads to an increase in the C-Co bond length for MeCbl(II) model compounds from 1.969 A (DFT and HF calculations) to 2.164 A in the base-on MeCbl(II) model and from 1.938 A to 2.144 A in the base-off MeCbl(II) model. Concomitantly, the Co-N axial bond length increases from 2.121 A (DFT) to 2.344 A in the CASSCF calculation. This coupling interaction between states can be used to explain the much lower Co-C bond dissociation enthalpy and much faster bond cleavage rate for the one-electron reduced methylcobalamin radical anion compared to MeCbl(III). It may also be important for axial bond distances in other Co(II) compounds.",

Photoelectron spectra of maleic and fumaric acid monoanions (cis-/trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-)) were obtained at low temperatures and at 193 nm photon energy. Vibrational structure was observed for trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) due to the OCO bending modes; however, cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) yielded a broad and featureless spectrum. The electron binding energy of cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) is about 1 eV blue-shifted relative to trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond in the cis-isomer. Theoretical calculations (CCSD(T)/ aug-cc-pVTZ and B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ) were carried out to estimate the strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-).

However, C1q has a number of other observed functions, not directly related to complement, that could be mediated by recently identified binding proteins acting as cell-surface receptors or soluble modulators of C1q-mediated functions.

We demonstrate that a high amount of the exact (HF) exchange in the DFT functional leads to a polyynic structure of C18, in agreement with the experiment. We show that in complexes of C18 with electron donors, the lowest excited states are charge separated states formed by electron transfer to C18. This makes C18 the smallest all-carbon electron acceptor reported so far. Because C18 exhibits a larger internal reorganization energy compared to fullerene C60, the electron transfer reactions with relatively high driving force will be shifted from the inverted to the normal Marcus regime when replacing C60 by C18.",

The CH3Cl + H2O system is remarkable because of its propensity to form CH3Cl:H2O and CH3Cl:(H2O)n (n &gt; or = 2) complexes. We focus here on the CH3Cl:H2O species.

We demonstrate that a high amount of the exact (HF) exchange in the DFT functional leads to a polyynic structure of C18, in agreement with the experiment. We show that in complexes of C18 with electron donors, the lowest excited states are charge separated states formed by electron transfer to C18. This makes C18 the smallest all-carbon electron acceptor reported so far. Because C18 exhibits a larger internal reorganization energy compared to fullerene C60, the electron transfer reactions with relatively high driving force will be shifted from the inverted to the normal Marcus regime when replacing C60 by C18.",

Interestingly, we have found that the HOMO-LUMO gap of [20]π porphycene is larger than that of [18]π porphycene, which is in a sharp contrast with those of typical [4n]/[4n+2]π porphyrinoids. Based on our observations, we demonstrate that the origin of this contrasting feature of [20]π porphycene arises from the uniquely large energy splitting between LUMO and LUMO+1 of [18]π porphycene compared with other aromatic [4n+2]π porphyrinoids with nearly degenerate LUMO/LUMO+1. Consequently, we can propose that the energy difference between LUMO and LUMO+1 levels of aromatic [4n+2]π porphyrinoids is an important factor in determining the electronic nature of their corresponding antiaromatic [4n]π porphyrinoids. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to illustrate the photophysical properties of porphycenes with [4n]π electronic circuits.",

CH3N and N2 were the only observed primary products. The translational energy release suggests a simple bond rupture mechanism forming singlet methylnitrene, 1CH3N, and N2. Thus, these experiments reveal the unimolecular decomposition of this highly unstable species. We explain our observations through a mechanism which is initiated by the isomerization of 1CH3N to a highly internally excited methanimine H2C=NH isomer, which decomposes by 1,1-H2 elimination forming HNC+H2 as well as sequential H-atom loss (N-H followed by C-H bond cleavage), to form HCN.

Rather than deprotonation, a clean reduction to NHC=CH-CH=NHC is observed with a variety of bases. The apparent resistance towards deprotonation to the target compound led to a reinvestigation of the electronic structure of NHC→CC←NHC, which showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) gap is likely too small to allow for isolation of this species. This is in contrast to the recent isolation of the cyclic alkylaminocarbene analogue (cAAC=C=C=cAAC), which has a large HOMO-LUMO gap. A detailed theoretical study illuminates the differences in electronic structures between these molecules, highlighting another case of the potential advantages of using cAAC rather than NHC as a ligand. The bonding analysis suggests that the dicarbon compounds are well represented in terms of donor-acceptor interactions L→C2 ←L (L=NHC, cAAC).",

Alanopine was isolated by solvolysis of the polysaccharide with triflic acid followed by acid hydrolysis, and its (2S,4S)-configuration was determined by the specific optical rotation. The following structure of the O-polysaccharide was established (the d configuration of Qui4N was ascribed tentatively): [structure: see text].",

Thermal decomposition of adsorbed CH(3)NO(2) species leads to the formation of two types of NCO species (NCO on Ag and NCO on Al(2)O(3)) above 298K. In order to investigate the reaction mechanism, we have designed the calculated models (a-g) for the NCO intermediate. Through the analysis of the vibration mode and the vibration frequency of the calculated models (a-g), we conclude that there is an excellent agreement between the calculated vibration spectrum of the model (e) containing the -AgNCO group or model (g) containing the -AlNCO group and the experimental vibration spectrum.",

We first obtain the energy bands and orbital coefficients of protein FKBP12. On this basis, we found that the activity atoms and activity residues of FKBP12 were in good agreement with X-ray crystallography experiments. The results indicate that the interactions occur only between the LUMOs of FKBP12 and the HOMO of FK506, not between the HOMOs of FKBP12 and the LUMO of FK506. In other words, the activity sites of protein FKBP12 are located on its LUMOs, not HOMOs. The electron structures of FKBP12/FK506 give us a clearer understanding of their interaction mechanism and will help us design new ligands of FKBP12. ",

In this paper, we investigate this problem explicitly avoiding all the points of conflict from the previous papers to show that there is no quadruple bond in C2. The generalized product function energy partitioning (GPF-EP) method has been applied to calculate the interference energy (IE) that accounts for the formation of covalent bonds for each bond of the molecule. The IE analysis shows that for the standard σ and π bonds interference exhibits the expected behavior, while for the \"fourth\" bond interference is a destabilizing factor. To make sure this could not be attributed to a new kind of bond, we performed an equivalent analysis for the (3)Σ(-) excited state of C3 molecule in which similar \"bonding\" occurs between the two ending carbon atoms. We also show that the difference in force constants of C2 and acetylene can be rationalized in terms of the amount of charge density in the internuclear region by looking at the changes in the overlaps between orbitals along the bond axis.

We introduce a novel experimental approach: For molecules with pi-electron systems the transition C1s--&gt;2p(pi*) from inner-atomic to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) appears in X-ray absorption near edge spectra (NEXAFS) as an intense, sharp peak a few eV below the carbon K-edge.

Complementary information can be obtained from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS): At the low binding energy site of the spectrum a peak related to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) appears.

We introduce a novel experimental approach: For molecules with pi-electron systems the transition C1s--&gt;2p(pi*) from inner-atomic to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) appears in X-ray absorption near edge spectra (NEXAFS) as an intense, sharp peak a few eV below the carbon K-edge. Whereas the peak position reflects the energy of the first excited singlet state in relation to the ionization potential of the molecule, intensity and width of the transition depend on hybridization and bonding partners of the selected atom. Complementary information can be obtained from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS): At the low binding energy site of the spectrum a peak related to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) appears. We have measured NEXAFS and UPS of beta-carotene. Based on these measurements and quantum chemical calculations the HOMO and LUMO energies can be derived.",

We attempted to monitor the value of this parameter upon the unfolding process of cyt c by urea, during which it was increased sigmoidally from about 0.52 to 0.82 eV for native and unfold protein, respectively. Results indicate that by structural changes in the heme site, lambda provides a complementary tool for following the unfolding process.

To this end, we have predicted the molecular and electronic structures of a series of transition metal macrocyclic complexes with planar N4 chelation, as well as the molecular and electronic structures for the O2 adsorption on these macrocyclic molecules, using the density functional theory calculation method. We found that the calculated adsorption energy of O2 on the transition metal macrocyclic complexes was linearly related to the average position (relative to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the macrocyclic complexes) of the non-bonding d orbitals (d(z(2)), d(xy), d(xz), and d(yz)) which belong to the central transition metal atom. Importantly, our results suggest that varying the energy level of the non-bonding d orbitals through changing the central transition metal atom and/or peripheral ligand groups could be an effective way to tuning their O2 adsorption energy for enhancing the ORR activity of transition metal macrocyclic complex catalysts.",

The most stable structures were identified by comparing the results of our calculations with the experimental data. We found that the carbon atoms of VnC2(-/0) and VnC4(-/0) (n = 1-6) clusters were separated gradually with increasing number of vanadium atoms. For VnC2(-/0) (n = 3-6) and VnC4(-/0) (n = 4-6) clusters, the carbon atoms are separated by the vanadium atoms. The geometry of V4C4 is a cubic structure and the geometries of V5C4 and V6C4 are formed by one and two vanadium atoms capping the cubic V4C4 structure, respectively. ",

Recent calculations on the C(2)H(3)N(+*) potential energy surface have suggested that it may be difficult to generate pure CH(3)CN(+*) when ionizing acetonitrile. We have probed the interconversion of CH(3)CN(+*) and its lower energy isomer CH(2)CNH(+*) by calculation, collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry and ion-molecule reaction. The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS. CH(3)CN(+*) reacts by proton-transfer with CO(2) and charge transfer with COS, whereas CH(2)CNH(+*) is unreactive.",

The structure of this dimer consists of two fullerene cages, which are directly connected through two C-C bonds and two methylene bridges. Consequently, adjacent hexagonal faces of the two fullerene cages are arranged in a face to face manner. Molecular orbital calculations indicate that the proximity of the fullerene cages results in significant through space overlap in both the HOMO and LUMO. As a consequence of this overlap, the electrochemistry of the dimer shows electronic communication with stepwise reduction of each cage.",

Interestingly, we have found that the HOMO-LUMO gap of [20]π porphycene is larger than that of [18]π porphycene, which is in a sharp contrast with those of typical [4n]/[4n+2]π porphyrinoids. Based on our observations, we demonstrate that the origin of this contrasting feature of [20]π porphycene arises from the uniquely large energy splitting between LUMO and LUMO+1 of [18]π porphycene compared with other aromatic [4n+2]π porphyrinoids with nearly degenerate LUMO/LUMO+1. Consequently, we can propose that the energy difference between LUMO and LUMO+1 levels of aromatic [4n+2]π porphyrinoids is an important factor in determining the electronic nature of their corresponding antiaromatic [4n]π porphyrinoids. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to illustrate the photophysical properties of porphycenes with [4n]π electronic circuits.",

To study the intracellular trafficking of NCAM in neurons, two major isoforms, NCAM140 or NCAM180, were expressed in primary cortical neurons and in the rat B35 neuroblastoma cell line. NCAM was endocytosed and subsequently recycled to the plasma membrane, whereas only a minor fraction was degraded in lysosomes. In cortical neurons, endocytosis of NCAM was detected in the soma, neurites and growth cones in a developmentally regulated fashion. Furthermore, we found that NCAM is mono-ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane and endocytosis was significantly increased in cells overexpressing ubiquitin. Therefore, we propose that ubiquitylation represents an endocytosis signal for NCAM.",

For the C3 configuration this hydrogen bond is of red-shifted type in gas phase but turns into blue-shifted type in chloroform solution instead. It's inappropriate to simply designate this hydrogen bond as blue-shifted type or red-shifted type.",

In this paper, we investigate this problem explicitly avoiding all the points of conflict from the previous papers to show that there is no quadruple bond in C2. The generalized product function energy partitioning (GPF-EP) method has been applied to calculate the interference energy (IE) that accounts for the formation of covalent bonds for each bond of the molecule. The IE analysis shows that for the standard σ and π bonds interference exhibits the expected behavior, while for the \"fourth\" bond interference is a destabilizing factor. To make sure this could not be attributed to a new kind of bond, we performed an equivalent analysis for the (3)Σ(-) excited state of C3 molecule in which similar \"bonding\" occurs between the two ending carbon atoms. We also show that the difference in force constants of C2 and acetylene can be rationalized in terms of the amount of charge density in the internuclear region by looking at the changes in the overlaps between orbitals along the bond axis.

We show that in complexes of C18 with electron donors, the lowest excited states are charge separated states formed by electron transfer to C18. This makes C18 the smallest all-carbon electron acceptor reported so far.

Since the HOMO-LUMO and C-Co sigma-sigma MO gaps are significantly smaller in the MeCbl(II) compounds compared with MeCbl(III), a pseudo-Jahn Teller effect is possible. CASSCF calculations show that there is strong coupling between C-Co sigma-sigma MOs for the MeCbl(II) models leading to strong state mixing with significant total charge density transfer (approximately 0.4 e-), mainly from the C-Co sigma MO to C-Co sigma MO (approximately 0.3 e-). CASSCF(9:7) calculations show that the strong state mixing leads to an increase in the C-Co bond length for MeCbl(II) model compounds from 1.969 A (DFT and HF calculations) to 2.164 A in the base-on MeCbl(II) model and from 1.938 A to 2.144 A in the base-off MeCbl(II) model. Concomitantly, the Co-N axial bond length increases from 2.121 A (DFT) to 2.344 A in the CASSCF calculation. This coupling interaction between states can be used to explain the much lower Co-C bond dissociation enthalpy and much faster bond cleavage rate for the one-electron reduced methylcobalamin radical anion compared to MeCbl(III).

We first obtain the energy bands and orbital coefficients of protein FKBP12. On this basis, we found that the activity atoms and activity residues of FKBP12 were in good agreement with X-ray crystallography experiments. The results indicate that the interactions occur only between the LUMOs of FKBP12 and the HOMO of FK506, not between the HOMOs of FKBP12 and the LUMO of FK506. In other words, the activity sites of protein FKBP12 are located on its LUMOs, not HOMOs. The electron structures of FKBP12/FK506 give us a clearer understanding of their interaction mechanism and will help us design new ligands of FKBP12. ",

Copper incorporation into these enzymes is facilitated by metallochaperone proteins which probably use copper from a mitochondrial matrix-localized pool. Here we describe a novel conserved mitochondrial metallochaperone-like protein, Cmc1p, whose function affects both COX and Sod1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cmc1p localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane facing the intermembrane space. Cmc1p is essential for full expression of COX and respiration, contains a twin CX9C domain conserved in other COX assembly copper chaperones, and has the ability to bind copper(I). Additionally, mutant cmc1 cells display increased mitochondrial Sod1p activity, while CMC1 overexpression results in decreased Sod1p activity. Our results suggest that Cmc1p could play a direct or indirect role in copper trafficking and distribution to COX and Sod1p.",

The lowest-energy isomers C(102) (C(1): 603) and C(108) (D(2): 1771) are readily isolated experimentally because they are much lower in energy than their other low-lying IPR isomers.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Our detections allow estimates to be made of the fractional abundance of the unsubstituted similar species in these sources.  The fractional abundance relative to H2, f(C3H2), is 1-2 x 10(-8) in TMC-1, and this is similar to the abundance of HCN, one of the more abundant organic molecules in the interstellar medium.  In IRC +10216 f(C3H2) is one order of magnitude greater than in TMC-1.  The 12C species in Sgr B2 shows a self-absorbed profile and the relative abundance of C3H2 estimated to be about an order of magnitude less than in TMC-1.",

We first obtain the energy bands and orbital coefficients of protein FKBP12. On this basis, we found that the activity atoms and activity residues of FKBP12 were in good agreement with X-ray crystallography experiments. The results indicate that the interactions occur only between the LUMOs of FKBP12 and the HOMO of FK506, not between the HOMOs of FKBP12 and the LUMO of FK506. In other words, the activity sites of protein FKBP12 are located on its LUMOs, not HOMOs.

Surprisingly, the second most abundant dissociation channel is CS(+) and not CO(+) even though the thermochemical threshold for CO(+) is lower than that for CS(+) and CO(+) is more abundant than CS(+) in the normal mass spectrum of OCS. We do not observe any significant abundance of CO(+) in this energy range, suggesting that collision-induced excitation and dissociation of OCS(+) is significantly different to that of symmetric triatomic ions.

These calculations employ a novel technique called eCADD on the protein's full electron structure along with its hydrophobic pocket and the frontier-orbital-perturbation theory. We first obtain the energy bands and orbital coefficients of protein FKBP12. On this basis, we found that the activity atoms and activity residues of FKBP12 were in good agreement with X-ray crystallography experiments. The results indicate that the interactions occur only between the LUMOs of FKBP12 and the HOMO of FK506, not between the HOMOs of FKBP12 and the LUMO of FK506. In other words, the activity sites of protein FKBP12 are located on its LUMOs, not HOMOs. The electron structures of FKBP12/FK506 give us a clearer understanding of their interaction mechanism and will help us design new ligands of FKBP12. ",

Endocytic trafficking of Notch plays important roles in the activation and downregulation of this receptor. A Drosophila O-FucT-1 homolog, encoded by O-fut1, catalyzes the O-fucosylation of Notch, a modification essential for Notch signaling and ligand binding. It was recently proposed that O-fut1 acts as a chaperon for Notch in the endoplasmic reticulum and is required for Notch to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we report that O-fut1 has additional functions in the endocytic transportation of Notch. O-fut1 was indispensable for the constitutive transportation of Notch from the plasma membrane to the early endosome, which we show was independent of the O-fucosyltransferase activity of O-fut1. We also found that O-fut1 promoted the turnover of Notch, which consequently downregulated Notch signaling. O-fut1 formed a stable complex with the extracellular domain of Notch. In addition, O-fut1 protein added to conditioned medium and endocytosed was sufficient to rescue normal Notch transportation to the early endosome in O-fut1 knockdown cells. Thus, an extracellular interaction between Notch and O-fut1 is essential for the normal endocytic transportation of Notch. We propose that O-fut1 is the first example, except for ligands, of a molecule that is required extracellularly for receptor transportation by endocytosis.",

According to B3LYP calculations, ONCO has a trans configuration, with bond angles of angleONC approximately 136.3 degrees and angleNOC approximately 160.7 degrees. Calculated vibrational wave numbers, IR intensities, 15N-, 13C-, and 18O-isotopic shifts for ONCO agree satisfactorily with experimental results.

We introduce a novel experimental approach: For molecules with pi-electron systems the transition C1s--&gt;2p(pi*) from inner-atomic to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) appears in X-ray absorption near edge spectra (NEXAFS) as an intense, sharp peak a few eV below the carbon K-edge.

In this study, we have elucidated the structure of this novel adduct with the use of mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 13C NMR as a substitution product of a -C(Cl) = CCl2 moiety for a beta-hydrogen atom on the prosthetic heme's ring I vinyl group. From studies with the use of 13C-enriched BrCCl3, it was determined that the added carbon atoms were derived from 2 eq of BrCCl3. A mechanism that involves multiple reductive events and a radical cation heme intermediate is proposed. Consistent with this mechanism, cellular reductants were found to selectively enhance the amount of this novel dissociable heme adduct. These studies reveal fine differences between myoglobin and hemoglobin in the accessibility of reactive intermediates to the ring I vinyl group, as well as the potential importance of cellular reductants on the course of heme alteration.",

The CCl2 parent molecule was generated in a molecular beam by pyrolysis of CHCl3, and both CCl2 and the CCl photofragment were detected by laser fluorescence excitation. The 193 nm attenuation cross section was estimated from the reduction of the CCl2 signal as a function of the photolysis laser fluence. The internal state distribution of the CCl photofragment was derived from analysis of laser fluorescence excitation spectra in the A 2Delta-X 2Pi band system. Most of the energy available to the CCl(X 2Pi)+Cl fragments appears as translational energy. The CCl fragment rotational energy is much less than predicted in an impulsive model. The excited electronic state appears to dissociate indirectly, through coupling with a repulsive state arising from the ground-state CCl(X 2Pi)+Cl asymptote. The identity of the initially excited electronic state is discussed on the basis of what is known about the CCl2 electronic states.",

We demonstrate that a high amount of the exact (HF) exchange in the DFT functional leads to a polyynic structure of C18, in agreement with the experiment. We show that in complexes of C18 with electron donors, the lowest excited states are charge separated states formed by electron transfer to C18. This makes C18 the smallest all-carbon electron acceptor reported so far.

The electron binding energy of cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) is about 1 eV blue-shifted relative to trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond in the cis-isomer. Theoretical calculations (CCSD(T)/ aug-cc-pVTZ and B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ) were carried out to estimate the strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-).

We attempted to monitor the value of this parameter upon the unfolding process of cyt c by urea, during which it was increased sigmoidally from about 0.52 to 0.82 eV for native and unfold protein, respectively. Results indicate that by structural changes in the heme site, lambda provides a complementary tool for following the unfolding process.

The data set was fitted with the new Hamiltonian model to derive the molecular parameters. The results indicate that the model developed for the other methanol species (CH3OH, CH3(18)OH and CH3OD) is also valid for the C-13 substituted species. The results will allow the energy levels of the molecule to be calculated for higher torsional levels above the internal rotational barrier with improved precision and allow the analysis to be carried out for more excited torsional states.",

We have synthesized 13C and 15N labeled polyglycine samples with the distance between the two labels and the local atomic environment of the 13C label systematically varied. We have measured four masses in parallel: 12C, 13C, and two of 12C14N, 13C14N, 12C15N, and 13C15N. We have calculated the 13C/12C isotope ratio, and the different combinations of the CN isotope ratios (27CN/26CN, 28CN/27CN, and 28CN/26CN). We have measured a high 13C15N- secondary ion current from the 13C and 15N labeled polyglycines, even when the 13C and 15N labels are separated. By comparing the magnitude of the varied combinations of isotope ratios among the samples with different labeling positions, we conclude the following: CN- formation is in large fraction due to recombination of C and N; the CO double bond decreases the extent of CN- formation compared to the case where carbon is singly bonded to two hydrogen atoms; and double-labeling with 13C and 15N allows us to detect with high sensitivity the molecular ion 13C15N-.",

We demonstrate that a high amount of the exact (HF) exchange in the DFT functional leads to a polyynic structure of C18, in agreement with the experiment. We show that in complexes of C18 with electron donors, the lowest excited states are charge separated states formed by electron transfer to C18. This makes C18 the smallest all-carbon electron acceptor reported so far. Because C18 exhibits a larger internal reorganization energy compared to fullerene C60, the electron transfer reactions with relatively high driving force will be shifted from the inverted to the normal Marcus regime when replacing C60 by C18.",

From the theoretical aspects, a new pathway via isomerization transition state (TS) at 391 ± 8 kJ∕mol is found leading to the CO + CH3NC products. An amount of 60% reactant molecules at 300 K is estimated to successfully surpass the average TS barrier lying above the excitation energy by 3.5 kJ∕mol. Further, a prior distribution method is conducted to characterize the vibrational energy distribution of CO on a statistical basis. The pathway to CH3NC + CO yields a vibrational branching ratio (v = 0:v = 1:v = 2:v = 3∼0.63:0.25:0.093:0.032) in excellent agreement with the observation (0.62:0.25:0.09:0.05). ",

It is found that the ab initio values for the nu1 and nu3 bands are about 50 and 30% larger, respectively.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The electron affinities of the neutral CnS (n = 2, 4-7) and CnS2 (n = 2-7) clusters are determined based on the experimental adiabatic detachment energies of the corresponding anion species, because the most stable structures of the neutral clusters are similar to those of the corresponding anions.

The simulation finds that for the pi pi* excitation, the relaxation of the S(pi pi*) state is immediately followed by double excitation, (pi)(2)(pi*)(2). The decay from the S((pi)(2)(pi*)(2)) state to the S(0) state can occur at partially twisted structure, which favors the formation of the trans isomer. Multiple decay channels are found at about twisted structure for both n pi* and pi pi* excitations. Decay at about twisted geometry leads to the formation of either cis or trans isomer.

Photoelectron spectra of maleic and fumaric acid monoanions (cis-/trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-)) were obtained at low temperatures and at 193 nm photon energy. Vibrational structure was observed for trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) due to the OCO bending modes; however, cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) yielded a broad and featureless spectrum. The electron binding energy of cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) is about 1 eV blue-shifted relative to trans-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-) due to the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bond in the cis-isomer. Theoretical calculations (CCSD(T)/ aug-cc-pVTZ and B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ) were carried out to estimate the strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in cis-HO(2)CCH=CHCO(2)(-). Combining experimental and theoretical calculations yields an estimate of 21.5 +/- 2.0 kcal/mol for the intramolecular hydrogen bond strength in hydrogen maleate.",

The degree of BLA changes continuously with increasing n: starting with essentially nonalternating structures (cumulenic), then turning into strongly alternating (acetylenic) structures.

Interestingly, we have found that the HOMO-LUMO gap of [20]π porphycene is larger than that of [18]π porphycene, which is in a sharp contrast with those of typical [4n]/[4n+2]π porphyrinoids. Based on our observations, we demonstrate that the origin of this contrasting feature of [20]π porphycene arises from the uniquely large energy splitting between LUMO and LUMO+1 of [18]π porphycene compared with other aromatic [4n+2]π porphyrinoids with nearly degenerate LUMO/LUMO+1. Consequently, we can propose that the energy difference between LUMO and LUMO+1 levels of aromatic [4n+2]π porphyrinoids is an important factor in determining the electronic nature of their corresponding antiaromatic [4n]π porphyrinoids.

The calculations give a larger bond dissociation energy for Cl(3)B[bond]NH(3) than for F(3)B[bond]NH(3). Calculations of the deformation energy of the bonded fragments reveal that the distortion of BCl(3) and BF(3) from the equilibrium geometry to the pyramidal form in the complexes requires nearly the same energy. The higher Lewis acid strength of BCl(3) in X(3)B[bond]H(3) compared with BF(3) is an intrinsic property of the molecule. The energy partitioning analysis of Cl(3)B[bond]NH(3) and F(3)B[bond]NH(3) shows that the stronger bond in the former complex comes from enhanced covalent interactions between the Lewis acid and the Lewis base which can be explained with the energetically lower lying LUMO of BCl(3).",

Because C18 exhibits a larger internal reorganization energy compared to fullerene C60, the electron transfer reactions with relatively high driving force will be shifted from the inverted to the normal Marcus regime when replacing C60 by C18.",

The geometry of the CO3 intermediate plays an important role in explaining these effects; however, only the cyclic (C(2v)) isomer has been experimentally confirmed so far. Here, we report on the first spectroscopic detection of the acyclic (D(3h)) isomer of carbon trioxide (12C16O3) via its nu1 and nu2 vibrational modes centered around 1165 cm(-1) under matrix isolation conditions; the identification of the 12C18O3, 13C16O3, 13C18O3, 16O12C18O2, and 18O12C16O2 isotopomers of the acyclic isomer confirms the assignments.",
