Triflates tend to react comparably to bromides in the Stille reaction. Acyl chlorides are also used as coupling partners and can be used with a large range of organostannane, even alkyl-tin reagents, to produce ketones (see example below). However, it is sometimes difficult to introduce acyl chloride functional groups into large molecules with sensitive functional groups. An alternative developed to this process is the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling reaction, which introduces the carbonyl group via carbon monoxide insertion.",

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Tris(trimethylsilyl)silanol can be employed as a halogen abstractor in combination with photoredox and Ni catalysis. Sequential oxidative addition In cases where two electrophiles have different chemical reactivity, this difference can be used to achieve high selectivity for cross product.",

Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Sarett in 1953. It was popularized by Collins several years later.",

This is an important reaction for artificially producing biologically relevant molecules including the A ring of steroids. Perhaps the most intriguing application of the Zincke–Suhl reaction is its potential following von Auwers rearrangements. Demeunier and Jaeckh described how such rearrangements may result in the formation of high energy intermediates. For example, reformation of the aromatic ring from the semibenzene (cyclohexadienone) follows an energy drop of just under 36 kcal/mol. Such staunch drops have been experimentally shown to lead to efficient aromatization with high yields. Other products including dioxocins and polymers can form depending upon the location of the initial addition of carbon tetrachloride. Furthermore, changes to the reagents such as the use of chloroform instead of carbon tetrachloride can form additional products.",

Methylene chloride is the typical solvent, with the solubility of 12.5 g/100 mL. The application of this reagent to oxidations was discovered by G. I. Poos, G. E. Arth, R. E. Beyler and L.H.

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

With added salt the main product is 1,4-adduct A (82%) with some C (7%). A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

A nucleophilic addition follows of the amine with formation of 4a and its tautomer 4b loses water to form the resonance stabilized cation 5a.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Unlike Negishi's reagent, Rosenthal's reagent is stable at room temperature and can be stored indefinitely under an inert atmosphere. A much more precise control over the stoichiometry of reactions is possible, especially because the instable (1-butene)zirconocene cannot be formed quantitatively. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents. While for titanium complexes, a dissociative reaction mechanism has been observed, zirconium complexes favor an associative pathway. The combination of these organometallic complexes with different suitable substrates (e.g. carbonyl compounds, acetylenes, imines, azoles, etc.) often leads to novel bond types and reactivities.

They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only qualitative analysis is required. So the amino acid does not have to be eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange",

Reaction mechanism Tebbe's reagent itself does not react with carbonyl compounds, but must first be treated with a mild Lewis base, such as pyridine, which generates the active Schrock carbene. Also analogous to the Wittig reagent, the reactivity appears to be driven by the high oxophilicity of Ti(IV). The Schrock carbene (1) reacts with carbonyl compounds (2) to give a postulated oxatitanacyclobutane intermediate (3). This cyclic intermediate has never been directly isolated, presumably because it breaks down immediately to the produce the desired alkene (5).",

Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

Instead of producing ethylene, the majority of methane was non-selectively oxidized to carbon dioxide.

Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

Grignard reagents are basic and react with alcohols, phenols, etc. to give alkoxides (ROMgBr). The phenoxide derivative is susceptible to formylation by paraformaldehyde to give salicylaldehyde. Alkylation of metals and metalloids Like organolithium compounds, Grignard reagents are useful for forming carbon–heteroatom bonds. Grignard reagents react with many metal-based electrophiles. For example, they undergo transmetallation with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) to give dialkylcadmium: 2 RMgX + CdCl2 → R2Cd + 2 Mg(X)Cl",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

In the process, the metal is oxidised, CO is evolved, and the organic ligand is released for further manipulation. For example, with the Wulff–Dötz reaction an alkyne, carbon monoxide, and a chromium carbene are combined to form a chromium half-sandwich complex and the phenol ligand can be isolated by mild CAN oxidation. CAN is used to cleave para-methoxybenzyl and 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl ethers, which are protecting groups for alcohols. Two equivalents of CAN are required for each equivalent of para-methoxybenzyl ether. The alcohol is released, and the para-methoxybenzyl ether converts to para-methoxybenzaldehyde.

Perhaps the most intriguing application of the Zincke–Suhl reaction is its potential following von Auwers rearrangements. Demeunier and Jaeckh described how such rearrangements may result in the formation of high energy intermediates. For example, reformation of the aromatic ring from the semibenzene (cyclohexadienone) follows an energy drop of just under 36 kcal/mol. Such staunch drops have been experimentally shown to lead to efficient aromatization with high yields. Other products including dioxocins and polymers can form depending upon the location of the initial addition of carbon tetrachloride. Furthermore, changes to the reagents such as the use of chloroform instead of carbon tetrachloride can form additional products.",

The addition is syn unless a coordinating group is nearby in the substrate, in which case the addition becomes anti and yields improve. (6)",

Both of these mechanisms predict inversion at the electrophilic carbon, which is observed in a number of cases.

Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

It was developed in the laboratory of Edward M. Burgess at Georgia Tech. The Burgess reagent is used to convert secondary and tertiary alcohols with an adjacent proton into alkenes. Dehydration of primary alcohols does not work well. The reagent is soluble in common organic solvents and alcohol dehydration takes place with syn elimination through an intramolecular elimination reaction. The Burgess reagent is a carbamate and an inner salt. A general mechanism is shown below. Preparation The reagent is prepared from chlorosulfonylisocyanate by reaction with methanol and triethylamine in benzene: References Reagents for organic chemistry Quaternary ammonium compounds Carbamates Zwitterions Dehydrating agents",

Negligible kinetic isotope effect with fully deuterated reactants (=1.07). Hence, it is inferred that hydride transfer is not rate-determining. Significant competitive isotope effect with C2H2D2, (= ~1.9), suggests that rate determining step be prior to formation of acetaldehyde.

For a carbon center, the result of α-elimination is the formation of a carbene, which includes \"stable carbenes\" such as carbon monoxide or isocyanides. For instance, α-elimination the elements of HCl from chloroform (CHCl3) in the presence of strong base is a classic approach for the generation of dichlorocarbene, :CCl2, as a reactive intermediate. On the other hand, formic acid undergoes α-elimination to afford the stable products water and carbon monoxide under acidic conditions. α-Elimination may also occur on a metal center, one particularly common result of which is lowering of both the metal oxidation state and coordination number by 2 units in a process known as reductive elimination. (Confusingly, in organometallic terminology, the terms α-elimination and α-abstraction refer to processes that result in formation of a metal-carbene complex.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Triflates tend to react comparably to bromides in the Stille reaction. Acyl chlorides are also used as coupling partners and can be used with a large range of organostannane, even alkyl-tin reagents, to produce ketones (see example below). However, it is sometimes difficult to introduce acyl chloride functional groups into large molecules with sensitive functional groups. An alternative developed to this process is the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling reaction, which introduces the carbonyl group via carbon monoxide insertion.",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material.

Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition. The 1,4-addition mechanism of cuprates to enones goes through the nucleophilic addition of the Cu(I) species at the beta-carbon of the alkene to form a Cu(III) intermediate, followed by reductive elimination of Cu(I). In the original paper describing this reaction, methylmagnesium bromide is reacted with isophorone with and without 1 mole percent of added copper(I) chloride (see figure).",

Proton exchange with carboxylic acid 4 activates the iminium ion 5 for nucleophilic addition of the isocyanide 6 with its terminal carbon atom to nitrilium ion 7. A second nucleophilic addition takes place at this intermediate with the carboxylic acid anion to 8. The final step is a Mumm rearrangement with transfer of the R4 acyl group from oxygen to nitrogen. All reaction steps are reversible except for the Mumm rearrangement, which drives the whole reaction sequence. In the related Passerini reaction (lacking the amine) the isocyanide reacts directly with the carbonyl group but other aspects of the reaction are the same. This reaction can take place concurrently with the Ugi reaction, acting as a source of impurities. Variations",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

A much more precise control over the stoichiometry of reactions is possible, especially because the instable (1-butene)zirconocene cannot be formed quantitatively. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents. While for titanium complexes, a dissociative reaction mechanism has been observed, zirconium complexes favor an associative pathway. The combination of these organometallic complexes with different suitable substrates (e.g. carbonyl compounds, acetylenes, imines, azoles, etc.) often leads to novel bond types and reactivities.

Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

This increases the δ+ on the α-carbon, thus 1,2-addition of sodium amide is favored over 1,4-addition. The proximity of the amino group to the α-carbon once the coordination complex is formed also makes the 1,2-addition more likely to occur.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

This work foreshadowed extensive studies on the conjugate additions to enones with organocuprates. Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition. The 1,4-addition mechanism of cuprates to enones goes through the nucleophilic addition of the Cu(I) species at the beta-carbon of the alkene to form a Cu(III) intermediate, followed by reductive elimination of Cu(I). In the original paper describing this reaction, methylmagnesium bromide is reacted with isophorone with and without 1 mole percent of added copper(I) chloride (see figure).",

In the 1980s and 1990s multiple research efforts were pursued by academic investigators and petrochemical companies. Hundreds of catalysts have been tested, and several promising candidates were extensively studied. Researchers were unable to achieve the required chemoselectivity for economic operation. Instead of producing ethylene, the majority of methane was non-selectively oxidized to carbon dioxide. The lack of selectivity was related to the poor C-H activation of known catalysts, requiring high reaction temperatures (750 ˚C and 950 ˚C) to activate the C-H bond. This high reaction temperature establishes a secondary gas-phase reaction mechanism pathway, whereby the desired reaction of methyl radical coupling to products (leading to ethylene) strongly competes with COx side reactions.",

Organocopper complexes very often need Lewis acid activation in order to react efficiently; magnesium bromide generated in situ serves as an activating Lewis acid in this case. (7) Alkenylcopper complexes, easily generated through carbocupration, are useful for the introduction of a vinyl group in the β position of a carbonyl compound.

Unlike Negishi's reagent, Rosenthal's reagent is stable at room temperature and can be stored indefinitely under an inert atmosphere. A much more precise control over the stoichiometry of reactions is possible, especially because the instable (1-butene)zirconocene cannot be formed quantitatively. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents. While for titanium complexes, a dissociative reaction mechanism has been observed, zirconium complexes favor an associative pathway. The combination of these organometallic complexes with different suitable substrates (e.g. carbonyl compounds, acetylenes, imines, azoles, etc.) often leads to novel bond types and reactivities.

It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

The terms reactant and reagent are often used interchangeably—however, a reactant is more specifically a substance consumed in the course of a chemical reaction. Solvents, though involved in the reaction mechanism, are usually not called reactants. Similarly, catalysts are not consumed by the reaction, so they are not reactants. In biochemistry, especially in connection with enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the reactants are commonly called substrates. __notoc__",

In the process, the metal is oxidised, CO is evolved, and the organic ligand is released for further manipulation. For example, with the Wulff–Dötz reaction an alkyne, carbon monoxide, and a chromium carbene are combined to form a chromium half-sandwich complex and the phenol ligand can be isolated by mild CAN oxidation. CAN is used to cleave para-methoxybenzyl and 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl ethers, which are protecting groups for alcohols. Two equivalents of CAN are required for each equivalent of para-methoxybenzyl ether. The alcohol is released, and the para-methoxybenzyl ether converts to para-methoxybenzaldehyde. The balanced equation is as follows: 2 (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 + H3COC6H4CH2OR + H2O → 4 NH4+ + 2 Ce3+ + 12 NO3− + 2 H+ + H3COC6H4CHO + HOR",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition.

Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents.

Secondary reactions are nucleophilic additions, transmetalations, conjugate additions, coupling reactions, carbonylation and halogenation. Computational studies indicate that hydrozirconation occurs from the interior portion. When treated with one equivalent of Cp2ZrClH, diphenylacetylene gives the corresponding alkenylzirconium as a mixture of cis and trans isomers. With two equivalents of hydride, the endproduct was a mixture of erythro and threo zircono alkanes:",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 reaction is often known as the dissociative substitution. This",

This is accomplished by activation from some catalyst - either cyanide (CN−) or thiazolium salt. For the use of either catalyst, the mechanism is very similar; the only difference is that with thiazolium salts, the catalyst must be deprotonated first to form the active catalytic species. The active catalyst can be described as the combination of two contributing resonance forms - an ylide or a carbene, both of which portray the nucleophilic character at carbon. The thiazolium ylide or CN− can then add into the aldehyde substrate, forming a cyanohydrin in the case of CN− or the Breslow intermediate in the case of thiazolium salt.

If an attempt is made to perform an SN1 reaction using a strongly basic nucleophile such as hydroxide or methoxide ion, the alkene will again be formed, this time via an E2 elimination. This will be especially true if the reaction is heated.

For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

The Gilman reagent is an effective nucleophile for 1,4-additions to conjugated carbonyls. The Michael reaction involves conjugate additions of enolates to conjugated carbonyls. The Stork enamine reaction involves the conjugate addition of enamines to conjugated carbonyls. Scope Conjugate addition is effective in the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds with the help of organometallic reagents such as the organozinc iodide reaction with methylvinylketone.",

In 2017 a patent application was submitted where the inventors introduced a novel method of NH4+ production without the need of any form of ammonia. In this method N2 and water vapor are introduced into the hollow cathode ion source and by adjusting electric fields and pressures NH4+ can be produced at the same or even higher purity levels than H3O+. It is expected that this invention, which eliminates the problems connected to the use of NH4+ so far, will lead to a widespread use of NH4+ reagent ions in the near future.",

Alcohol synthesis from organoboranes and borates relies on either nucleophilic group transfer to a carbonyl group or oxidation of an intermediate organoborane. Homologated primary alcohols result from the treatment of organoboranes with carbon monoxide and a hydride.",

This oxidant is useful for the dehydrogenation of alcohols, phenols, and steroid ketones. DDQ decomposes in water, but is stable in aqueous mineral acid. Preparation Synthesis of DDQ involves cyanation of chloranil. J. Thiele and F. Günther first reported a 6-step preparation in 1906. The substance did not receive interest until its potential as a dehydrogenation agent was discovered. A single-step chlorination from 2,3-dicyanohydroquinone was reported in 1965. Reactions The reagent removes pairs of H atoms from organic molecules. The stoichiometry of its action is illustrated by the conversion of tetralin to naphthalene: 2 C6Cl2(CN)2O2 + C10H12 → 2 C6Cl2(CN)2(OH)2 + C10H8 The resulting hydroquinone is poorly soluble in typical reaction solvents (dioxane, benzene, alkanes), which facilitates workup.",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

A nucleophilic addition follows of the amine with formation of 4a and its tautomer 4b loses water to form the resonance stabilized cation 5a. This compound is deprotonated to the imine 5b or the enamine 5c but an equilibrium exists between both species. The enamine eliminates sodium bisulfite with formation of naphthylamine 6.

The catalytic cycle begins with dissociation of one CO ligand forming bis(alkyne) intermediate.

Although monoalkyne complexes CpCo(CO)(R1C2R2) have not been isolated, their analogues, CpCo(PPh3)(R1C2R2) are made by the following reactions: CpCo(CO)2 + PR3 → CO + CpCo(CO)(PR3) CpCoL(PR3) + R2C2 → L + CpCo(PR3)(R2C2) (where L = CO or PR3) CpCo(CO)2 catalyzes the formation of pyridines from a mixture of alkynes and nitriles. Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2].

(5) The addition of Grignard reagents to alkynes is facilitated by a catalytic amount of copper halide.

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents.

The addition is syn unless a coordinating group is nearby in the substrate, in which case the addition becomes anti and yields improve. (6)",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product. It does not matter if the hydrogens from the protic solvent react with the nucleophile since the nucleophile is not involved in the rate determining step.",

It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",

This compound is deprotonated to the imine 5b or the enamine 5c but an equilibrium exists between both species. The enamine eliminates sodium bisulfite with formation of naphthylamine 6. It is important to stress that this is a reversible reaction. The reaction is summarized as follows: The Bucherer carbazole synthesis is a related reaction. References",

The cationic cobalt complex exists in two separable linkage isomers. In the yellow-coloured isomer, the nitro ligand is bound through nitrogen. In the red linkage isomer, the nitrito is bound through one oxygen atom. The O-bonded isomer is often written as [Co(NH3)5(ONO)]2+. Although the existence of the isomers had been known since the late 1800s, only in 1907 was the structural difference explained. It was later shown that the red isomer converted to the yellow isomer upon UV-irradiation. In this particular example, the formation of the nitro isomer (Co-NO2) from the nitrito isomer (Co-ONO) occurs by an intramolecular rearrangement.

This increases the δ+ on the α-carbon, thus 1,2-addition of sodium amide is favored over 1,4-addition. The proximity of the amino group to the α-carbon once the coordination complex is formed also makes the 1,2-addition more likely to occur.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

In planning the synthesis of phenylacetic acid, two synthons are identified. A nucleophilic \"-COOH\" group, and an electrophilic \"PhCH2+\" group. Of course, both synthons do not exist per se; synthetic equivalents corresponding to the synthons are reacted to produce the desired product. In this case, the cyanide anion is the synthetic equivalent for the −COOH synthon, while benzyl bromide is the synthetic equivalent for the benzyl synthon. The synthesis of phenylacetic acid determined by retrosynthetic analysis is thus: PhCH2Br + NaCN → PhCH2CN + NaBr PhCH2CN + 2 H2O → PhCH2COOH + NH3 In fact, phenylacetic acid has been synthesized from benzyl cyanide, itself prepared by the analogous reaction of benzyl chloride with sodium cyanide.

Note that if a Grignard reagent (such as RMgBr) is used, the reaction with an enone would instead proceed through a 1,2-addition.

Also analogous to the Wittig reagent, the reactivity appears to be driven by the high oxophilicity of Ti(IV). The Schrock carbene (1) reacts with carbonyl compounds (2) to give a postulated oxatitanacyclobutane intermediate (3). This cyclic intermediate has never been directly isolated, presumably because it breaks down immediately to the produce the desired alkene (5).",

Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge.

It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

(5) The addition of Grignard reagents to alkynes is facilitated by a catalytic amount of copper halide. Transmetalation to copper and carbocupration are followed by transmetalation of the product alkene back to magnesium.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

These three reaction mechanisms can really be split into two pathways of peroxyacid attack - on either the oxygen or the carbon of the carbonyl group. Attack on oxygen could lead to two possible intermediates: Baeyer and Villiger suggested a dioxirane intermediate, while Georg Wittig and Gustav Pieper suggested a peroxide with no dioxirane formation. Carbon attack was suggested by Rudolf Criegee. In this pathway, the peracid attacks the carbonyl carbon, producing what is now known as the Criegee intermediate.",

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

CAN is used to cleave para-methoxybenzyl and 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl ethers, which are protecting groups for alcohols. Two equivalents of CAN are required for each equivalent of para-methoxybenzyl ether.

Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

The constitution of organocopper compounds depends on their method of preparation and the various kinds of organocopper reagents exhibit different reactivity profiles. As a result, the scope of reactions involving organocopper reagents is extremely broad. Organocopper complexes (RCu) are produced when a copper(I) halide and organolithium are combined. In conjunction with Lewis acidic additives such as boron trifluoride etherate, these reagents are used for conjugate addition reactions.",

It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

It was claimed in a German patent that the reaction of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with dialkyl cyanamides formed plant protection agents which contained six-membered (P-N=C-N=C-S-) rings. It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",

It was claimed in a German patent that the reaction of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with dialkyl cyanamides formed plant protection agents which contained six-membered (P-N=C-N=C-S-) rings. It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",

In the 1980s and 1990s multiple research efforts were pursued by academic investigators and petrochemical companies. Hundreds of catalysts have been tested, and several promising candidates were extensively studied. Researchers were unable to achieve the required chemoselectivity for economic operation. Instead of producing ethylene, the majority of methane was non-selectively oxidized to carbon dioxide. The lack of selectivity was related to the poor C-H activation of known catalysts, requiring high reaction temperatures (750 ˚C and 950 ˚C) to activate the C-H bond. This high reaction temperature establishes a secondary gas-phase reaction mechanism pathway, whereby the desired reaction of methyl radical coupling to products (leading to ethylene) strongly competes with COx side reactions.",

Regarding reactions using α, β-unsaturated carboxylic acids, Kuang et al. modified the reaction with using a new halogenating agent, N-halosuccinimide, and lithium acetate as the catalyst, which resulted in higher yield of β-Halostyrenes. They found that using the microwave irradiation could synthesize (E)-β-arylvinyl halide much quicker with higher yields. This is useful because synthesizing (E'')-vinyl bromide in general is not very practical due to the complexity of alternative reagents (e.g. organometallic compounds), longer reaction times, and lower yields. Using microwave irradiation also allows the synthesized arylvinyl halide to carry electron-donating groups (in addition to electron-withdrawing groups),",

For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

In the example below, conducting the reaction in THF led to transfer of the vinyl moiety, while other solvents promoted methyl transfer. (6)",

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge. In this case, tertiary carbocation will react faster than a secondary which will react much faster than a primary. It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

Acyl chlorides are also used as coupling partners and can be used with a large range of organostannane, even alkyl-tin reagents, to produce ketones (see example below). However, it is sometimes difficult to introduce acyl chloride functional groups into large molecules with sensitive functional groups. An alternative developed to this process is the Stille-carbonylative cross-coupling reaction, which introduces the carbonyl group via carbon monoxide insertion.",

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, K. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K > 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system.

Attack on oxygen could lead to two possible intermediates: Baeyer and Villiger suggested a dioxirane intermediate, while Georg Wittig and Gustav Pieper suggested a peroxide with no dioxirane formation. Carbon attack was suggested by Rudolf Criegee. In this pathway, the peracid attacks the carbonyl carbon, producing what is now known as the Criegee intermediate.",

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

Thus, the rate equation is often shown as having first-order dependence on electrophile and zero-order dependence on nucleophile. This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 reaction is often known as the dissociative substitution. This",

This similarity points to a likely mechanism. The zinc at the active site is tetrahedral, being coordinated by Cys 35, His 88, Cys 91 and water. The water is deprotonated to give a zinc hydroxide that adds the substrate to give a Zn-O-C(S)SH intermediate. A similar process is proposed to convert COS into .

Instead of producing ethylene, the majority of methane was non-selectively oxidized to carbon dioxide. The lack of selectivity was related to the poor C-H activation of known catalysts, requiring high reaction temperatures (750 ˚C and 950 ˚C) to activate the C-H bond.

Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents.

This increases the δ+ on the α-carbon, thus 1,2-addition of sodium amide is favored over 1,4-addition. The proximity of the amino group to the α-carbon once the coordination complex is formed also makes the 1,2-addition more likely to occur.

Elevated temperatures are typically required to effect the oxidation of less acidic carbonyl compounds.",

It was claimed in a German patent that the reaction of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with dialkyl cyanamides formed plant protection agents which contained six-membered (P-N=C-N=C-S-) rings. It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",
