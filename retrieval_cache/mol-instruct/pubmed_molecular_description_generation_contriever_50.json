The bimetallic complex [Co(Me-tpa)O2COZnCl3] results from the unexpected coordination of ZnCl3- to the exo O atom of a chelated carbonate ligand. This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution. The trimetallic complex [Co(trpyn)O2COZn(OH2)4OCO2Co(trpyn)](ZnCl4)2.H2O crystallises on prolonged standing of [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4 in a neutral solution having [Zn2+]=1.0 M. The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",

It was shown that CCl3 radicals add oxygen to form CCl3O2 radicals, which eventually yield three chloride ions and CO2. A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations. The rate constant for the oxygen addition to CCl3 radicals was determined by pulse radiolysis to 3.3 X 10(9) M-1 s-1.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

Ab initio calculations indicate that CH2=CCHO has a linear C-C-C backbone with Cs symmetry, where the formyl group is in the Cs plane and perpendicular to the methylene group. The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons. The crystal structures of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), p-ClC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) and p-BrC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) were determined by X-ray crystallography using single crystals. The coordination around the phosphorus center in these compounds is best described as distorted tetrahedral and the P(O) and C(O) groups are anti with respect to each other. In the compound Br-C(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) (with two independent molecules in the unit cell), two conformers are connected to each other via two different N-H...O hydrogen bonds forming a non-centrosymmetric dimer. In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Other chelating agents assayed, including o-phenanthroline, cannot replace NC in promoting the O2 formation. O2 is also produced by adding NC to a mixture of Cu(II) and H2O2. Concomitant with the O2 evolution, the typical absorbance of the (NC)2Cu(I) complex appears to account for the complete reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I).

The product is isolated after repeated trap-to-trap condensation. The solid compound melts at -84 degrees C, and the extrapolated boiling point is 80 degrees C. ClC(O)OONO(2) is characterized by IR, Raman, (13)C NMR, and UV spectroscopy. According to the IR matrix spectra, the compound exists at room temperature only as a single conformer. The molecular structure of ClC(O)OONO(2) is determined by gas electron diffraction. The molecule possesses a gauche structure with a dihedral angle of phi(COON) = 86.7(19) degrees , and the C=O bond is oriented syn with respect to the O-O bond. The short O-O bond (1.418(6) A) and the long N-O bond (1.511(8) A) are consistent with the facile dissociation of ClC(O)OONO(2) into the radicals ClC(O)OO and NO(2). The experimental geometry of ClC(O)OONO(2) is reproduced reasonably well by B3LYP/6-311+G(2df) calculations, whereas the MP2 approximation predicts the N-O bond considerably too long and the dihedral angle too small.",

From the theoretical aspects, a new pathway via isomerization transition state (TS) at 391 ± 8 kJ∕mol is found leading to the CO + CH3NC products. An amount of 60% reactant molecules at 300 K is estimated to successfully surpass the average TS barrier lying above the excitation energy by 3.5 kJ∕mol. Further, a prior distribution method is conducted to characterize the vibrational energy distribution of CO on a statistical basis. The pathway to CH3NC + CO yields a vibrational branching ratio (v = 0:v = 1:v = 2:v = 3∼0.63:0.25:0.093:0.032) in excellent agreement with the observation (0.62:0.25:0.09:0.05). ",

The molecular conformations and electronic structure of these three compounds were investigated by HeI photoelectron spectroscopy, photoionization mass spectroscopy, FT-IR, and theoretical calculations. They were theoretically predicted to prefer the [ss-c] conformation, with each C═O bond syn with respect to the opposite O-C bond and the C═C bond in cis orientation to the adjacent C═O bond. The experimental first vertical ionization potential for CH(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2), and CCl(3)C(O)OC(O)CHCH(2) was determined to be 10.91, 11.42, and 11.07 eV, respectively.

Molecular constants including the hyperfine interaction constants of CH2=CCHO in the (2)A(″) ground electronic state were precisely determined. Ab initio calculations indicate that CH2=CCHO has a linear C-C-C backbone with Cs symmetry, where the formyl group is in the Cs plane and perpendicular to the methylene group. The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom. The ground state CH2=CCHO can, thus, be described as taking the formylvinyl (CH2=Ċ-CH=O) form rather than as the allenyloxy (CH2=C=CH-Ȯ) form. ",

The UVC-photolysis (254 nm) of H2O2 added to aqueous solutions of CCl4 is leading to the homolysis of the oxidant yielding hydroxyl radicals (HO) that subsequently react with added methanol to generate hydroxymethyl radicals (CH2OH). The latter radicals initiate mineralization of CCl4 by reductive C-Cl bond splitting. CHCl3, C2Cl4 and C2Cl6 were found as reaction intermediates, but are quantitatively depleted in a parallel oxidative reaction manifold leading to mineralization. Carbon dioxide radical anion, CO2(-), an intermediate in the mineralization pathway of methanol, is also shown to initiate the mineralization of CCl4 by reductive dechlorination.

Neutrals MeCCCO, CCC(O)Me and PhCCCO are stable for the microsecond duration of the neutralisation experiment. A joint experimental and theoretical study (energies calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) suggests that the neutral radical CCC(O)Ph rearranges via a four-centred ipso radical cyclisation/ring opening to form the isomer PhCCCO in an exothermic reaction. (13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

A distinctive EPR spectrum with g = 2.08 is consistent with each W(2) carboxylate being a mixed-valent W(II)-W(III) species. The reaction of W(2)(OOCCF(3))(4) with (CO)(9)Co(3)CCOOH in THF in the absence of Na[OOCCF(3)] leads to the expected diamagnetic W(II)-W(II) cluster carboxylate W(2){OOCCCo(3)(CO)(9)}(3)(OOCCF(3))(THF)(2), 3.",

A weak cross-reaction of O-antiserum against P. mirabilis OC with the lipopolysaccharide of P. mirabilis O49 was accounted for by a similarity in the O-polysaccharide structures.",

Molecular weight determinations indicated mononuclear nature of the complexes. LMCT bands were observed in the electronic spectra. Infrared spectra suggested bidentate nature of the ligands. Fluorescent behaviour of the complexes was noticed on the basis of fluorescence spectra. Powder XRD indicated them to be semi-crystalline having the crystallite size in 136-185 nm range. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated spherical particles of ~ 200 nm diameter. On the basis of physico-chemical studies, it is suggested that titanium is having coordination number 7 or 8 in these complexes.",

An X-ray structure revealed a layered 2D arrangement of the heterometallic [[Rh(2)(O(2)CCF(3))(4)].micro(2)-OCMe(2).[Cu(4)(O(2)CCF(3))(4)]] units built by axial intermolecular interactions of the open electrophilic Rh(II) and Cu(I) centers and O-atoms of neighboring carboxylate groups. The coordination of the acetone molecules within the [[Rh(2)(O(2)CCF(3))(4)].micro(2)-OCMe(2).[Cu(4)(O(2)CCF(3))(4)]] unit is asymmetric with the Rh-O and Cu-O distances being 2.2173(15) and 2.7197(17) A, respectively. This work shows the potential of gas-phase deposition that may provide additional possibilities in supramolecular synthesis by utilizing intermolecular interactions and coordination bonds in a new way compared with conventional solution chemistry.",

The species formed are identified by the effects of isotopic substitution on their infrared spectra as well as density functional calculations. The results show that the ground state ScO molecule reacts with carbon dioxide to form the carbonate complex ScCO3 spontaneously on annealing. The ground state Sc atom reacts with two carbon dioxide molecules to give the carbonate carbonyl complex OCScCO3 via the previously reported OScCO insertion intermediate on annealing. The observation of these spontaneous reactions is consistent with theoretical predictions that both the Sc + 2CO2 → OCScCO3 and ScO + CO2 → ScCO3 reactions are thermodynamically exothermic and are kinetically facile, requiring little or no activation energy.

Isolation of bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and identification of bis(trifluoromethyl)trioxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3.\nThe synthesis of CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 is accomplished by the photolysis of a mixture of (CF3CO)2O, CO, and O2. Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy.

The results indicate that the half-wave potential of the ferrocenyl moieties is influenced by the Pb(II) ions in polymer 1 and strongly influenced by Zn(II), Cd(II), or Pb(II) ions in polymers 2-4. The thermal properties of the four polymers were also investigated.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates.

The new trioxide is obtained from the gas-phase photolytic reaction of CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CF(3) and FC(O)C(O)F at 223-228 K. It is a very thermally labile molecule that decomposes at room temperature by rupture of either of the CF(3)OC(O)O-O-OC(O)F bonds. These bonds are nonequivalent, and a branching ratio of 0.8 for fragmentation through the CF(3)OC(O)OO-OC(O)F bond was obtained.

Despite the fundamental role of this step, direct measurements of binding to transporters are rare. We investigated ion binding and selectivity in CLC-ec1, a H(+)-Cl(-) exchanger of the CLC family of channels and transporters. Cl(-) affinity depends on the conformation of the protein: it is highest with the extracellular gate removed and weakens as the transporter adopts the occluded configuration and with the intracellular gate removed. The central ion-binding site determines selectivity in CLC transporters and channels. A serine-to-proline substitution at this site confers NO(3)(-) selectivity upon the Cl(-)-specific CLC-ec1 transporter and CLC-0 channel. We propose that CLC-ec1 operates through an affinity-switch mechanism and that the bases of substrate specificity are conserved in the CLC channels and transporters.",

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

ClC(O)OONO(2) is characterized by IR, Raman, (13)C NMR, and UV spectroscopy. According to the IR matrix spectra, the compound exists at room temperature only as a single conformer. The molecular structure of ClC(O)OONO(2) is determined by gas electron diffraction. The molecule possesses a gauche structure with a dihedral angle of phi(COON) = 86.7(19) degrees , and the C=O bond is oriented syn with respect to the O-O bond. The short O-O bond (1.418(6) A) and the long N-O bond (1.511(8) A) are consistent with the facile dissociation of ClC(O)OONO(2) into the radicals ClC(O)OO and NO(2). The experimental geometry of ClC(O)OONO(2) is reproduced reasonably well by B3LYP/6-311+G(2df) calculations, whereas the MP2 approximation predicts the N-O bond considerably too long and the dihedral angle too small.",

Experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions.",

An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS.

Isolation of bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and identification of bis(trifluoromethyl)trioxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3.\nThe synthesis of CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 is accomplished by the photolysis of a mixture of (CF3CO)2O, CO, and O2. Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2.

The apparent resistance towards deprotonation to the target compound led to a reinvestigation of the electronic structure of NHC→CC←NHC, which showed that the highest occupied molecular orbital/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO/LUMO) gap is likely too small to allow for isolation of this species. This is in contrast to the recent isolation of the cyclic alkylaminocarbene analogue (cAAC=C=C=cAAC), which has a large HOMO-LUMO gap. A detailed theoretical study illuminates the differences in electronic structures between these molecules, highlighting another case of the potential advantages of using cAAC rather than NHC as a ligand.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points.

The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable. The fine and hyperfine constants also agree with those derived from the calculated spin density, where the unpaired electron is located mainly on the central carbon atom.

From the theoretical aspects, a new pathway via isomerization transition state (TS) at 391 ± 8 kJ∕mol is found leading to the CO + CH3NC products. An amount of 60% reactant molecules at 300 K is estimated to successfully surpass the average TS barrier lying above the excitation energy by 3.5 kJ∕mol. Further, a prior distribution method is conducted to characterize the vibrational energy distribution of CO on a statistical basis. The pathway to CH3NC + CO yields a vibrational branching ratio (v = 0:v = 1:v = 2:v = 3∼0.63:0.25:0.093:0.032) in excellent agreement with the observation (0.62:0.25:0.09:0.05). ",

The rearrangement of CCCCCHO to HCCCCCO.\nThe neutrals HCCCCCO and CCCCCHO have been studied by experiment and by molecular modelling at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Neutral HCCCCCO has been made by one-electron reduction of [HCCCCCO]+ in the dual collision cell of a VG ZAB 2HF mass spectrometer. The isomer CCCCCHO is also formed in the dual collision cell, but this time by one-electron oxidation of the anion [CCCCCHO]-. Comparison of the CID and +NR+ mass spectra of [HCCCCCO]+ indicates that neutral HCCCCCO, when energised, retains its structural integrity. If the excess energy of HCCCCCO is &gt; or = 170 kJ mol-1, decomposition can occur to give HCCCC and CO (calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory). The situation with the isomer CCCCCHO is different. Comparison of the -CR+ and -NR+ spectra of [CCCCCHO]- shows that both neutral and cationic forms of CCCCCHO partially rearrange to a species which decomposes by loss of CO. The peak corresponding to loss of CO is more pronounced in the -NR+ spectrum, indicating that the rearrangement is more prevalent for the neutral than the cation. Theoretical calculations suggest that the species losing CO could be CCCCHCO or HCCCCCO, but that HCCCCCO is the more likely. The lowest-energy rearrangement pathway occurs by successive H transfers, namely CCCCCHO--&gt;CCCCHCO--&gt;CCCHCCO--&gt;HCCCCCO. The rearrangement of CCCCCHO to HCCCCCO requires CCCCCHO to have an excess energy of &gt; or = 94 kJ mol-1. The species HCCCCCO formed by this exothermic sequence (214 kJ mol-1) has a maximum excess energy of 308 kJ mol-1: this is sufficient to effect decomposition to HCCCC and CO.",
