Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)].

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Since the first introduction of the energy span model, we started to believe that indeed there is. Herein we will evaluate from mathematical, physical and applied perspectives the advantages in using the energy representation for the depiction of the kinetics of catalysis, compared to the usual rate constant representation. We will discuss many concepts such as the energy span, the determining states, the determining zone, graph theory, affinity, degrees of rate control, robustness and volcano plots. Special emphasis will be put on the effect of reactants' and products' concentrations, and how to easily and accurately understand their influence on the kinetics. Ultimately, we will try to explore if energy truly is the measure of all things.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

Nevertheless, several works on this reaction have been carried out over the years, many of them were written in Italian in the period 1929-1966. In this review article we extensively cover, in a chronological order, the most important applications of the Bargellini reaction reported to date, with the hope that this knowledge-sharing will help chemists to properly use this multicomponent transformation and imagine novel reactivities based on it.",

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

'One-pot' tandem reactions, where multiple catalysts and reagents, combined in a single reaction vessel undergo a sequence of precisely staged catalytic steps, are highly attractive from the standpoint of reducing both waste and time. Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

The plots reproduce experimentally known trends while quantifying the magnitude to which the overall activity depends on a substrate's intrinsic electronic and steric properties and how these energetics are altered by the addition of substituent groups or changes to the core structure. Overall, the information revealed by these substrate volcanoes can be used in tandem with conventional molecular volcano plots to identify general catalyst design principles for a series of substrates.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

This review compiles recent progress in synthetic methodology that merges the functionalization of C-H bonds along with the cleavage of C-C bonds, either in intra- or intermolecular fashion. The manuscript is organized in two main sections according to the type of substrate in which the cleavage of the C-C bond takes place, basically attending to the scission of strained or unstrained C-C bonds. Furthermore, the related research works have been grouped on the basis of the mechanistic aspects of the different transformations that are carried out, i.e.,: (a) classic transition metal catalysis where organometallic intermediates are involved; (b) processes occurring via radical intermediates generated through the use of radical initiators or photochemically; and (c) reactions that are catalyzed or mediated by suitable Lewis or Brønsted acid or bases, where molecular rearrangements take place. Thus, throughout the review a wide range of synthetic approaches show that the combination of C-H and C-C cleavage in single synthetic operations can serve as a platform to achieve complex molecular skeletons in a straightforward manner, among them interesting carbo- and heterocyclic scaffolds.",

This renaissance is undoubtedly due to the recent developments in NHC-catalyzed reactions, including new benzoin, Stetter, homoenolate, and aroylation processes. These transformations employ typical as well as Umpolung types of bond disconnections and have served as the key step in several new total syntheses.

This review compiles recent progress in synthetic methodology that merges the functionalization of C-H bonds along with the cleavage of C-C bonds, either in intra- or intermolecular fashion. The manuscript is organized in two main sections according to the type of substrate in which the cleavage of the C-C bond takes place, basically attending to the scission of strained or unstrained C-C bonds. Furthermore, the related research works have been grouped on the basis of the mechanistic aspects of the different transformations that are carried out, i.e.,: (a) classic transition metal catalysis where organometallic intermediates are involved; (b) processes occurring via radical intermediates generated through the use of radical initiators or photochemically; and (c) reactions that are catalyzed or mediated by suitable Lewis or Brønsted acid or bases, where molecular rearrangements take place. Thus, throughout the review a wide range of synthetic approaches show that the combination of C-H and C-C cleavage in single synthetic operations can serve as a platform to achieve complex molecular skeletons in a straightforward manner, among them interesting carbo- and heterocyclic scaffolds.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

In synthesis, as in other endeavors, beauty is very much in the eyes of the beholder.

Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.

In synthesis, as in other endeavors, beauty is very much in the eyes of the beholder. It is with this in mind that we will attempt to review an area of synthesis that has fascinated us and that we find extraordinarily beautiful, namely the combination of catalysis and sigmatropic rearrangements in consecutive and cascade sequences.",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with <iNSR</i the interesting field of C-H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.",

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4. In this case, computational results support electrochemical data in backing a direct electron transfer reaction.",

Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

Recently, the new concept of \"tandem catalysis\" in domino reactions, in which catalyst(s) sequentially activate more than two mechanistically distinct reactions, has been proposed. Tandem catalysis is categorized into three subclasses: orthogonal-, auto-, and assisted-tandem catalyses. Auto-tandem catalysis is defined as a process in which one catalyst promotes more than two fundamentally different reactions in a single reactor.

Similar to pericyclic reactions, an electron count can be used to predict reactivity and stereochemistry. The \"coarctate rules\" are derived from a topological variant of the aromaticity of the transition state principle. Pseudocoarctate transition states exhibit disconnections in the topology of orbital overlap and do not necessarily follow the coarctate rules.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

However, its applicability to large-scale synthesis is undermined by the fact that alcohol activation occurs at the expense of two stoichiometric reagents - a phosphine and an azodicarboxylate. The ideal Mitsunobu reaction would be sub-stoichiometric in the phosphine and azodicarboxylate species and employ innocuous terminal oxidants and reductants to achieve recycling. This Review article provides a summary and analysis of recent advances towards the development of such catalytic Mitsunobu reactions.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

Among the MCRs, those with isocyanides have developed into popular organic-chemical reactions in the pharmaceutical industry for the preparation of compound libraries of low-molecular druglike compounds. With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products. MCRs and especially MCRs with isocyanides offer many opportunities to attain new reactions and basic structures. However, this requires that the chemist learns the \"language\" of MCRs, something that this review wishes to stimulate.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Even the 35 or so building blocks from which these crucial molecules are made each contain, at most, six contiguous C-C bonds, except for the three aromatic amino acids. Taking our cue from nature's approach, we address here the development of a set of powerful, highly reliable, and selective reactions for the rapid synthesis of useful new compounds and combinatorial libraries through heteroatom links (C-X-C), an approach we call \"click chemistry\". Click chemistry is at once defined, enabled, and constrained by a handful of nearly perfect \"spring-loaded\" reactions.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Most notably, RMG can now generate heterogeneous catalysis models in addition to the previously available gas- and liquid-phase capabilities. For model analysis, new methods for local and global uncertainty analysis have been implemented to supplement first-order sensitivity analysis. The RMG database of thermochemical and kinetic parameters has been significantly expanded to cover more types of chemistry. The present release includes parallelization for faster model generation and a new molecule isomorphism approach to improve computational performance. RMG has also been updated to use Python 3, ensuring compatibility with the latest cheminformatics and machine learning packages. Overall, RMG v3.0 includes many changes which improve the accuracy of the generated chemical mechanisms and allow for exploration of a wider range of chemical systems.",

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples.

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis.

The \"coarctate rules\" are derived from a topological variant of the aromaticity of the transition state principle.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions.

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

With a small set of starting materials, very large libraries can be built up within a short time, which can then be used for research on medicinal substances. Due to the intensive research of the last few years, many new backbone types have become accessible. MCRs are also increasingly being employed in the total synthesis of natural products.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

It then transpired that Nierenstein was boycotted because it was deemed that he had not responded adequately to criticisms of his work made by his rival in catechin research, the German natural products chemist, Karl Freudenberg. It was not until 1929 that, as a result of a petition by a group of his former Bristol pupils and friends, that Nierenstein was again permitted to publish in the Society's journal. The paper explores the Chemical Society's treatment of Nierenstein in detail, sheds new light on his career and his reaction to the Society's unprecedented boycott, examines some of the structural chemistry involved in the disputes, and discusses whether Nierenstein's research deserves the label of 'bad science'.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For years, the goal was to develop catalysts that were highly selective for a single transformation. However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence. This Minireview focuses on methods in which the mechanisms of the transformations are fundamentally very different.",

In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions.

In addition this methodology allows the study of larger, periodic, systems, revealing computationally unique information which may be directly compared to experiments on realistic chemical systems.

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Direct measurements have allowed new or more detailed understanding of each type of gas-phase reaction that carbonyl oxides undergo, often acting as a complement to highly detailed ozonolysis experiments. Moreover, the use of direct characterization methods to validate increasingly accurate theoretical investigations can enhance their impact well beyond the set of specific reactions that have been measured.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

To date a multitude of new three- and four-component reactions have already been described; however, examples of \"higher-order\" MCRs where five or even more components are combined in a single reaction vessel are remarkably scarce. This tutorial review aims to critically describe the developments achieved in recent years, charting the ideas, challenges, and milestone reactions that were essential for the progress of this field.",

'One-pot' tandem reactions, where multiple catalysts and reagents, combined in a single reaction vessel undergo a sequence of precisely staged catalytic steps, are highly attractive from the standpoint of reducing both waste and time. Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.

For 40 years, Nozoe carried with him his autograph books and collected his treasures which The Chemical Record is now publishing. Vladimir Prelog signed first when he was 47 and signed last when he was almost 80. Derek Barton signed first when he was 35 and signed last when he was almost 70. Time! I was fascinated by Eva Wille's recommendation that we publish an essay by Eva-Maria Tanzer, a young organic chemist with already a lifetime's experience in exploring chemical research in laboratories around the world. Tanzer brings to us a charming, even innocent perspective that embraces so much of Tetsuo Nozoe's ideals. We are privileged to include Tanzer's vision and her experiences in the collection of essays that accompany the Nozoe Autograph Books.

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence. This Minireview focuses on methods in which the mechanisms of the transformations are fundamentally very different.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

The RMG database of thermochemical and kinetic parameters has been significantly expanded to cover more types of chemistry. The present release includes parallelization for faster model generation and a new molecule isomorphism approach to improve computational performance.

An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory.

This indicator was proposed to be especially useful for reactants with multiple reactive sites, especially if the nature of the reactivity at those sites was different. This suggests that this reactivity indicator is especially appropriate for ambidentate molecules; this paper confirms this hypothesis. The general-purpose reactivity indicator not only identifies the most reactive sites, it also identifies which substrates prefer which reactive sites. In particular, the reactivity indicator allows one to clearly distinguish which sites of an ambidentate molecule are most reactive when electron transfer from the attacking reagent is large (a soft reagent) and which sites are most reactive when the attacking reagent is hard and highly charged (so that electron transfer is relatively insignificant). To illustrate the efficacy of the indicator for nucleophiles we consider SCN(-), SeCN(-), NO(2)(-), SO(3)(2-). For electrophiles we consider dimethyl carbonate, N-methyl-N-nitrosotoluene-p-sulfonamide (MNTS), and 1-chloro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (CNB).",

There was then a continuous increase in papers on the chemistry of this complex reaction to identify its various pathways: in food science, to evaluate the influence of reaction parameters (pH, T degrees , time, sugar reactivity, concentration of the reagents, water activity, glass transition temperature) on the evolution of the reaction and on changes in food quality; in nutrition, to quantify the loss of bioavailability of essential amino acids; on the metabolism of the reaction products and on the physiological effects of the ingested Maillard reaction products. The significant scientific advances and the key persons and pioneers who contributed much to the understanding of the Maillard reaction are presented.

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide-ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.",

To examine the knowledgebase of machine-learning models-what does the machine learn-this article deconstructs black-box machine-learning models of a diverse chemical reaction data set. Through experimentation with chemical representations and modeling techniques, the analysis provides insights into the nature of how statistical accuracy can arise, even when the model lacks informative physical principles. By peeling back the layers of these complicated models we arrive at a minimal, chemically intuitive model (and no machine learning involved). This model is based on systematic reaction-type classification and Evans-Polanyi relationships within reaction types which are easily visualized and interpreted. Through exploring this simple model, we gain deeper understanding of the data set and uncover a means for expert interactions to improve the model's reliability.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

This review compiles recent progress in synthetic methodology that merges the functionalization of C-H bonds along with the cleavage of C-C bonds, either in intra- or intermolecular fashion. The manuscript is organized in two main sections according to the type of substrate in which the cleavage of the C-C bond takes place, basically attending to the scission of strained or unstrained C-C bonds. Furthermore, the related research works have been grouped on the basis of the mechanistic aspects of the different transformations that are carried out, i.e.,: (a) classic transition metal catalysis where organometallic intermediates are involved; (b) processes occurring via radical intermediates generated through the use of radical initiators or photochemically; and (c) reactions that are catalyzed or mediated by suitable Lewis or Brønsted acid or bases, where molecular rearrangements take place. Thus, throughout the review a wide range of synthetic approaches show that the combination of C-H and C-C cleavage in single synthetic operations can serve as a platform to achieve complex molecular skeletons in a straightforward manner, among them interesting carbo- and heterocyclic scaffolds.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols. The wide-ranging work of Menshutkin, the physical organic chemist, is discussed.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

These may at first appear unrelated to each other but may have the potential to be united into a greater hypothesis after repeated feedback. Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

As these compounds provide a multitude of reactivity options, we feel that a broad overview of their multiple reaction modes may reveal less familiar opportunities for successful total synthesis planning. This personal account article will thus focus on α-aminonitriles used as key intermediates in selected natural product synthesis sequences which have been reported in the two decades since Enders' and Shilvock's seminal review. Natural α-aminonitriles will also briefly be treated.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Catalysts in domino reactions have also been well studied. In these reactions, a catalyst activates the substrate(s) only once, and the structure of the product is delineated at that time. Recently, the new concept of \"tandem catalysis\" in domino reactions, in which catalyst(s) sequentially activate more than two mechanistically distinct reactions, has been proposed. Tandem catalysis is categorized into three subclasses: orthogonal-, auto-, and assisted-tandem catalyses. Auto-tandem catalysis is defined as a process in which one catalyst promotes more than two fundamentally different reactions in a single reactor. An overview of recent and significant achievements in auto-tandem catalysis is presented in this paper.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity.

Herein we will evaluate from mathematical, physical and applied perspectives the advantages in using the energy representation for the depiction of the kinetics of catalysis, compared to the usual rate constant representation. We will discuss many concepts such as the energy span, the determining states, the determining zone, graph theory, affinity, degrees of rate control, robustness and volcano plots. Special emphasis will be put on the effect of reactants' and products' concentrations, and how to easily and accurately understand their influence on the kinetics. Ultimately, we will try to explore if energy truly is the measure of all things.",

An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory.

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

For model analysis, new methods for local and global uncertainty analysis have been implemented to supplement first-order sensitivity analysis. The RMG database of thermochemical and kinetic parameters has been significantly expanded to cover more types of chemistry. The present release includes parallelization for faster model generation and a new molecule isomorphism approach to improve computational performance. RMG has also been updated to use Python 3, ensuring compatibility with the latest cheminformatics and machine learning packages.

Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data).

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Its implementation in Python3 using CGRTools toolkit has been used to clean three popular reaction databases Reaxys, USPTO and Pistachio. The curated USPTO database is available in the GitHub repository (Laboratoire-de-Chemoinformatique/Reaction_Data_Cleaning).",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives. Among all chemical bonds, the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond is one of the most common, and is present in almost every organic compound. Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field. His group developed a number of C-H activation catalysts-often consisting of metal centers and elaborately designed ligands-that drastically shorten the synthesis steps of diverse functional molecules and provide high reactivity and selectivity. Here, Professor Yu discussed with <iNSR</i the interesting field of C-H activation, as well as sharing reflections on his own research.",

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory.

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples.

This indicator was proposed to be especially useful for reactants with multiple reactive sites, especially if the nature of the reactivity at those sites was different. This suggests that this reactivity indicator is especially appropriate for ambidentate molecules; this paper confirms this hypothesis. The general-purpose reactivity indicator not only identifies the most reactive sites, it also identifies which substrates prefer which reactive sites. In particular, the reactivity indicator allows one to clearly distinguish which sites of an ambidentate molecule are most reactive when electron transfer from the attacking reagent is large (a soft reagent) and which sites are most reactive when the attacking reagent is hard and highly charged (so that electron transfer is relatively insignificant). To illustrate the efficacy of the indicator for nucleophiles we consider SCN(-), SeCN(-), NO(2)(-), SO(3)(2-). For electrophiles we consider dimethyl carbonate, N-methyl-N-nitrosotoluene-p-sulfonamide (MNTS), and 1-chloro-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (CNB).",

To examine the knowledgebase of machine-learning models-what does the machine learn-this article deconstructs black-box machine-learning models of a diverse chemical reaction data set. Through experimentation with chemical representations and modeling techniques, the analysis provides insights into the nature of how statistical accuracy can arise, even when the model lacks informative physical principles. By peeling back the layers of these complicated models we arrive at a minimal, chemically intuitive model (and no machine learning involved). This model is based on systematic reaction-type classification and Evans-Polanyi relationships within reaction types which are easily visualized and interpreted. Through exploring this simple model, we gain deeper understanding of the data set and uncover a means for expert interactions to improve the model's reliability.",

Benchmarking is accomplished via an online game that links the decisions made by expert chemists and engineers to real experiments run in the laboratory. Our findings demonstrate that Bayesian optimization outperforms human decisionmaking in both average optimization efficiency (number of experiments) and consistency (variance of outcome against initially available data).

However, reactive chemical hazard evaluation at the R&amp;D scale presents special challenges. The typical hazard testing program requires a significant amount of sample, often takes time (&gt;3 days) to complete, and is can be quite costly. On the other hand, the synthesis of new molecules in the R&amp;D environment often produces only a few grams, occurs quickly (&lt;2 days), may only happen once and many synthetic reactions may be carried out before a suitable candidate for scale-up will be found. However, with each new synthesis there is the risk of injury, possibly serious or fatal, caused by unexpected and maybe violent reactivity. While it may not be possible at the R&amp;D stage of product development to define the critical limits of temperature, pressure, concentration, and safe dosing rates of processes it is possible to identify the potential hazards of the planned synthesis. This paper describes a staged approach for chemical reactivity hazard evaluation and assessment applicable to an R&amp;D environment.

However, the role of Lawesson's reagent in synthesis has changed drastically, and now its use can help the chemistry community to understand innovative ideas. These include constructing biologically valuable heterocycles, coupling reactions, and the thionation of natural compounds. The ease of availability and the convenient usage of LR as a thionating agent made us compile a review on the new diverse applications on some common functional groups, such as ketones, esters, amides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids, with biological applications. Since the applications of LR are now diverse, we have also included some new classes of heterocycles such as thiazepines, phosphine sulfides, thiophenes, and organothiophosphorus compounds. Thionation of some biologically essential steroids and terpenoids has also been compiled.

This review compiles recent progress in synthetic methodology that merges the functionalization of C-H bonds along with the cleavage of C-C bonds, either in intra- or intermolecular fashion. The manuscript is organized in two main sections according to the type of substrate in which the cleavage of the C-C bond takes place, basically attending to the scission of strained or unstrained C-C bonds. Furthermore, the related research works have been grouped on the basis of the mechanistic aspects of the different transformations that are carried out, i.e.,: (a) classic transition metal catalysis where organometallic intermediates are involved; (b) processes occurring via radical intermediates generated through the use of radical initiators or photochemically; and (c) reactions that are catalyzed or mediated by suitable Lewis or Brønsted acid or bases, where molecular rearrangements take place. Thus, throughout the review a wide range of synthetic approaches show that the combination of C-H and C-C cleavage in single synthetic operations can serve as a platform to achieve complex molecular skeletons in a straightforward manner, among them interesting carbo- and heterocyclic scaffolds.",

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)].

Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility.

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner. Whereas much early work was focused on using a catalyst for several similar transformations, recent investigations have shown that it is also possible to employ a single catalyst for several very different transformations in a single reaction sequence.

We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples.

This is consistent with experimental evidence that there is a transition region, not simply a specific point. We show graphically that significant nonsynchronicity in the process is associated with the development of a maximum of κ(R) in the transition region, which increases as the process becomes more nonsynchronous. (We speculate that for a nonconcerted process this maximum is actually positive.) Thus, κ(R) can serve as an indicator of the level of nonsynchronicity.",

Starting from Arrhenius [Z. Phys. Chem. 4, 226 (1889)], we follow especially the formulation of transition state theory by Wigner [Z. Phys. Chem. Abt. B 19, 203 (1932)] and Eyring [J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935)]. Transition state theory (TST) made it possible to obtain quick estimates for reaction rates for a broad variety of processes even during the days when sophisticated computers were not available. Arrhenius' suggestion that a transition state exists which is intermediate between reactants and products was central to the development of rate theory. Although Wigner gave an abstract definition of the transition state as a surface of minimal unidirectional flux, it took almost half of a century until the transition state was precisely defined by Pechukas [Dynamics of Molecular Collisions B, edited by W. H. Miller (Plenum, New York, 1976)], but even this only in the realm of classical mechanics. Eyring, considered by many to be the father of TST, never resolved the question as to the definition of the activation energy for which Arrhenius became famous. In 1978, Chandler [J. Chem. Phys. 68, 2959 (1978)] finally showed that especially when considering condensed phases, the activation energy is a free energy, it is the barrier height in the potential of mean force felt by the reacting system. Parallel to the development of rate theory in the chemistry community, Kramers published in 1940 [Physica (Amsterdam) 7, 284 (1940)] a seminal paper on the relation between Einstein's theory of Brownian motion [Einstein, Ann. Phys. 17, 549 (1905)] and rate theory. Kramers' paper provided a solution for the effect of friction on reaction rates but left us also with some challenges. He could not derive a uniform expression for the rate, valid for all values of the friction coefficient, known as the Kramers turnover problem. He also did not establish the connection between his approach and the TST developed by the chemistry community. For many years, Kramers' theory was considered as providing a dynamic correction to the thermodynamic TST. Both of these questions were resolved in the 1980s when Pollak [J. Chem. Phys. 85, 865 (1986)] showed that Kramers' expression in the moderate to strong friction regime could be derived from TST, provided that the bath, which is the source of the friction, is handled at the same level as the system which is observed. This then led to the Mel'nikov-Pollak-Grabert-Hanggi [Mel'nikov and Meshkov, J. Chem. Phys. 85, 1018 (1986); Pollak, Grabert, and Hanggi, ibid. 91, 4073 (1989)] solution of the turnover problem posed by Kramers. Although classical rate theory reached a high level of maturity, its quantum analog leaves the theorist with serious challenges to this very day. As noted by Wigner [Trans. Faraday Soc. 34, 29 (1938)], TST is an inherently classical theory. A definite quantum TST has not been formulated to date although some very useful approximate quantum rate theories have been invented. The successes and challenges facing quantum rate theory are outlined. An open problem which is being investigated intensively is rate theory away from equilibrium. TST is no longer valid and cannot even serve as a conceptual guide for understanding the critical factors which determine rates away from equilibrium. The nonequilibrium quantum theory is even less well developed than the classical, and suffers from the fact that even today, we do not know how to solve the real time quantum dynamics for systems with \"many\" degrees of freedom.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained.

During its long history (almost as long as the history of organic chemistry itself), attitudes towards this famous statement of chemical reactivity have evolved from indifference up to the 1930s, through common acceptance as a useful educational paradigm with marginal use in research up to the 1990s, to its vigorous relaunch as an important designation of regioselectivity in the last few decades. The unexpected new popularity of the classical rule is accounted for by the rapid expansion in catalytic addition reactions and their critical importance as highly effective atom-economical, regioselective methods in modern organic synthesis. A historical outline of the life and achievements of Vladimir Markovnikov is included to reveal the very wide scope of his interests as well as his prophetic predictions on structure, reactivity, selectivity, stereochemistry, and other key issues of organic chemistry.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

However, having him listed among the authors of two name reactions, known as Norrish Type I and Type II, plus a subcase of the latter that is the Yang cyclization, is not coherent. Indeed, Norrish had no interest in organic synthesis, while this is a required feature of name reactions. And, at any rate, Professors Ciamician and Paternò had arrived at the same conclusions with the same compounds much earlier, except for the measurement of quantum yields. Things are too long away now for introducing any change, but one should remember that using Norrish name here is a mistake, while it would be appropriate to add the name of Ciamician for a different name reaction, the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of alkenes and conjugated carbonyls. In 1968, such an attribution was proposed by Professor Schömberg, but this had no effect and the present assignment has become a habit.

Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

However, having him listed among the authors of two name reactions, known as Norrish Type I and Type II, plus a subcase of the latter that is the Yang cyclization, is not coherent. Indeed, Norrish had no interest in organic synthesis, while this is a required feature of name reactions. And, at any rate, Professors Ciamician and Paternò had arrived at the same conclusions with the same compounds much earlier, except for the measurement of quantum yields. Things are too long away now for introducing any change, but one should remember that using Norrish name here is a mistake, while it would be appropriate to add the name of Ciamician for a different name reaction, the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of alkenes and conjugated carbonyls. In 1968, such an attribution was proposed by Professor Schömberg, but this had no effect and the present assignment has become a habit.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) is a software suite developed to automatically generate such models by incorporating and extrapolating from a database of known thermochemical and kinetic parameters. Here, we present the recent version 3 release of RMG and highlight improvements since the previously published description of RMG v1.0. Most notably, RMG can now generate heterogeneous catalysis models in addition to the previously available gas- and liquid-phase capabilities. For model analysis, new methods for local and global uncertainty analysis have been implemented to supplement first-order sensitivity analysis. The RMG database of thermochemical and kinetic parameters has been significantly expanded to cover more types of chemistry. The present release includes parallelization for faster model generation and a new molecule isomorphism approach to improve computational performance. RMG has also been updated to use Python 3, ensuring compatibility with the latest cheminformatics and machine learning packages. Overall, RMG v3.0 includes many changes which improve the accuracy of the generated chemical mechanisms and allow for exploration of a wider range of chemical systems.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

Very little is known, however, about the large-scale patterns of this exploration. Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

These reaction classes include coupling reactions of halobenzenes and arenes, reductive cleavages of dithianes, and SRN1 reactions. Direct electron transfer would imply that alkali metal alkoxides are willing partners in these electron transfer reactions, but the literature reports provide little or no experimental evidence for this. This paper examines each of these classes of reaction in turn, and contests the roles proposed for KOtBu; instead, it provides new mechanistic information that in each case supports the in situ formation of organic electron donors. We go on to show that direct electron transfer from KOtBu can however occur in appropriate cases, where the electron acceptor has a reduction potential near the oxidation potential of KOtBu, and the example that we use is CBr4.

They differ from other concerted reactions, such as S(N)2, E2, or pericyclic reactions, in such a way that atoms are involved in the transition state at which two bonds are made and two bonds are broken simultaneously. Similar to pericyclic reactions, an electron count can be used to predict reactivity and stereochemistry. The \"coarctate rules\" are derived from a topological variant of the aromaticity of the transition state principle. Pseudocoarctate transition states exhibit disconnections in the topology of orbital overlap and do not necessarily follow the coarctate rules.",

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

Special emphasis will be put on the effect of reactants' and products' concentrations, and how to easily and accurately understand their influence on the kinetics. Ultimately, we will try to explore if energy truly is the measure of all things.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Yet a rigorous method for identifying the rate-determining step in a reaction mechanism was only recently introduced, via the \"degree of rate control\" of elementary steps. By extending that idea, we argue that even more useful than identifying the rate-determining step is identifying the rate-controlling transition states and the rate-controlling intermediates. These identify a few distinct chemical species whose relative energies we could adjust to achieve a faster or slower net reaction rate. Their relative energies could be adjusted by a variety of practical approaches, such as adding or modifying a catalyst, modifying the solvent, or simply modifying a reactant's molecular structure to affect electronic or steric control on the relative energies of the key species. Since these key species are the ones whose relative energies most strongly influence the net reaction rate, they also identify the species whose energetics must be most accurately measured or calculated to achieve an accurate kinetic model for any reaction mechanism. Thus, it is very important to identify these rate-controlling transition states and rate-controlling intermediates for both applied and basic research. Here, we present a method for doing that.",

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed. Stereocontrolled MCRs, rarely observed without the presence of a catalytic system, are also presented and discussed in this review. Perspectives on the use of catalytic systems for improved and greener MCRs are finally presented.",

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\". Thus, it can be said that by reviewing what we had done before, we were able to expand on it to achieve new outcomes.",

By breaking and forming chemical bonds, chemists can transform one molecule into another, and provide a variety of chemicals that we use in our daily lives.

Breaking C-H bonds and connecting the carbon atoms with other atoms or groups is an essential step for the synthesis of a large variety of chemicals-from bulk chemicals to functional materials and drug candidates. However, the C-H bond is extremely stable and difficult to break, and C-H activation and functionalization has been a challenging fundamental problem for decades. Professor Jin-Quan Yu () from the Scripps Research Institute is one of the most active scientists in this field.

Orthogonal tandem catalysis is a subset of one-pot reactions in which more than one catalyst is used to promote two or more mechanistically distinct reaction steps. This Perspective summarizes and analyses some of the recent developments and successes in orthogonal tandem catalysis, with particular focus on recent strategies to address catalyst incompatibility. We also highlight the concept of thermodynamic leveraging by coupling multiple catalyst cycles to effect challenging transformations not observed in single-step processes, and to encourage application of this technique to energetically unfavourable or demanding reactions.

Three scenarios from our research are presented: the \"oxidative-reductive condensation reaction\" devised in 1960, which after an interval of nearly 40 years brought forth the new concept of using compounds of structure Ph(2)POR as reducing reagents; the \"TiCl(4)-aldol reaction\" of 1973 that eventually led to the present \"base-promoted aldol reaction\" through a chain of ideas; and the \"glycosylation reaction using fluorosugars\" from 1984 which recently bloomed into \"stereocontrolled glycosylation\".

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation. Key parameters, such as temperature, catalyst amounts and reagent quantities, were analyzed. Solvent effects, which are likely the most neglected topic in MCRs, as well as their combined roles with catalysis, are critically discussed.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Here we show, by analyzing millions of reactions stored in the Reaxys database, that chemists have reported new compounds in an exponential fashion from 1800 to 2015 with a stable 4.4% annual growth rate, in the long run neither affected by World Wars nor affected by the introduction of new theories. Contrary to general belief, synthesis has been the means to provide new compounds since the early 19th century, well before Wöhler's synthesis of urea. The exploration of chemical space has followed three statistically distinguishable regimes. The first one included uncertain year-to-year output of organic and inorganic compounds and ended about 1860, when structural theory gave way to a century of more regular and guided production, the organic regime. The current organometallic regime is the most regular one. Analyzing the details of the synthesis process, we found that chemists have had preferences in the selection of substrates and we identified the workings of such a selection. Regarding reaction products, the discovery of new compounds has been dominated by very few elemental compositions. We anticipate that the present work serves as a starting point for more sophisticated and detailed studies of the history of chemistry.",

A Critical Review.\nWe review the most innovative efforts and greatest challenges faced when elucidating multicomponent reactions (MCRs) mechanisms. When compared to traditional reactions, the often two or more concurrent reactions pathways and the greater number of possible intermediates in MCRs turn their mechanistic investigation both a harder and trickier task. The common approaches used to investigate reaction mechanisms are often unable to clarify MCRs mechanisms; hence few but clever approaches are currently used to determine these mechanisms and to depict their key transformations. Their complexity has required most innovative approaches and the use of a number of unique techniques that have shed light over the favored pathway selected from the myriad of alternatives theoretically available for MCRs. This review focuses on the most successful efforts applied by a few leading groups to perform these puzzlingly investigations.",

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

However, having him listed among the authors of two name reactions, known as Norrish Type I and Type II, plus a subcase of the latter that is the Yang cyclization, is not coherent. Indeed, Norrish had no interest in organic synthesis, while this is a required feature of name reactions. And, at any rate, Professors Ciamician and Paternò had arrived at the same conclusions with the same compounds much earlier, except for the measurement of quantum yields. Things are too long away now for introducing any change, but one should remember that using Norrish name here is a mistake, while it would be appropriate to add the name of Ciamician for a different name reaction, the 2 + 2 cycloaddition of alkenes and conjugated carbonyls. In 1968, such an attribution was proposed by Professor Schömberg, but this had no effect and the present assignment has become a habit.

Besides improving yields and shortening reaction times, catalysis is vital to achieving greener protocols and to furthering the MCR field of research. Considering that MCRs typically have two or more possible reaction pathways to explain the transformation, catalysis is essential for selecting a reaction route and avoiding byproduct formation.

In these studies, he deduced an order of reactivity of alcohols in esterification on the basis of their reactions with acetic acid, and the effects of acid structure on the rates of esterification based on the reaction of the carboxylic acid with isobutyl alcohol. When his attention later turned to the substitution chemistry of amines, he defined the parameters that affected their reactions: anilines were less reactive than alkylamines, secondary more reactive than primary amines, and the reaction was accelerated by replacing benzene as a solvent with alcohols.

For each stage, a division is made between simple kinetics and complex kinetics. Simple kinetics means that the general rate law is used and results are reported as zero-, first- or second-order reactions (sometimes a fractional order). It is emphasized that this approach for a complex reaction as the Maillard reaction only results in a mathematical fit procedure, not in mechanistic insight. The rate constants and activation energies derived are in fact composed of several elementary rate constants. With complex kinetics, i.e. trying to establish the kinetics for individual reaction steps, more mechanistic information can be extracted. However, there are conflicting results in literature and the interpretation is not always correct, as is shown in several examples. A summary of activation energies reported for the various stages in the Maillard reaction reveals large discrepancies, probably reflecting strong effects of experimental conditions on results that are obtained. Careful control of experimental conditions and proper kinetic analysis of the various stages in the Maillard reaction should lead to more consistent results in the future.",

Undoubtedly, both reactions are very important multicomponent reactions but the Ugi reactions outperform the Passerini reactions in terms of combinatorial space according to the equation <ix<supy</sup</i [<ix</i is the number of building blocks per component, and <iy</i is the order of the multicomponent reaction (for Passerini, <iy</i = 3; for Ugi, <iy</i = 4)]. In this work, a historical but contemporary perspective of the discoveries and innovations of the two reactions is given. From a bird's eye view and in a more general sense, the discovery of novel reactions is discussed and how it relates to inventions and innovations.",

However, a promising current area of research is the use of a single catalyst to mediate more than one transformation in a selective manner.
