Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO. For the mixed valence CcO, starting from the [FeOO] complex, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound I of the oxo heme.

These anions provide access to the corresponding neutral reactive intermediates: the OCCO diradical and the HOCCO and OHCCO radicals. Contrasting the straightforward deprotonation pathway in the reaction of O(-) with glyoxal (OHCCHO), which is expected to yield glyoxalide (OHCCO(-)), OHCCO(-) is shown to be a minor product, with HOCCO(-) being the dominant observed isomer of the m/z = 57 anion. In the HOCCO/OHCCO anion photoelectron spectrum, we identify several electronic states of this radical system and determine the adiabatic electron affinity of HOCCO as 1.763(6) eV. This result is compared to the corresponding 1.936(8) eV value for ethylenedione (OCCO), reported in our recent study of this transient diradical [A. R. Dixon, T. Xue, and A. Sanov, Angew.

We have investigated the products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 3-hexene-2,5-dione in the presence of NO at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of air using in situ atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2. Our observation of a molecular weight 102 species indicates that the CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 radical dominantly decomposes to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO plus CH3(*C)O, rather than decomposing to CH3C(O)CHO plus CH3C(O)(*C)HOH, isomerizing, or reacting with O2.

We have investigated the products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 3-hexene-2,5-dione in the presence of NO at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of air using in situ atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

In this study, we have elucidated the structure of this novel adduct with the use of mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 13C NMR as a substitution product of a -C(Cl) = CCl2 moiety for a beta-hydrogen atom on the prosthetic heme's ring I vinyl group.

A mechanism that involves multiple reductive events and a radical cation heme intermediate is proposed. Consistent with this mechanism, cellular reductants were found to selectively enhance the amount of this novel dissociable heme adduct.

Transitions with spin and hyperfine splittings were observed for two isotopologs, CCC(35)Cl and CCC(37)Cl, in the region from 11.4 GHz for N=2-1 to 34.2 GHz for N=6-5. The molecular constants including the hyperfine coupling constants due to the Cl nucleus have been determined precisely. From the rotational analyses and high-level ab initio calculations, the molecular structure of the CCCCl radical is concluded to be bent in the ground electronic state.",

In this study, we have elucidated the structure of this novel adduct with the use of mass spectrometry, as well as 1H and 13C NMR as a substitution product of a -C(Cl) = CCl2 moiety for a beta-hydrogen atom on the prosthetic heme's ring I vinyl group. From studies with the use of 13C-enriched BrCCl3, it was determined that the added carbon atoms were derived from 2 eq of BrCCl3. A mechanism that involves multiple reductive events and a radical cation heme intermediate is proposed. Consistent with this mechanism, cellular reductants were found to selectively enhance the amount of this novel dissociable heme adduct.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Subsequently, 5 can undergo either C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         ) (CH(2)CHCCH+H) or C-C bond cleavage to generate P                         (                            7                         ) (C(2)H(2)+C(2)H(3)).

Various possible isomerization and dissociation pathways are probed. The initial association between C((3)P) and trans-C(4)H(8) is found to be the C((3)P) addition to the C=C bond of trans-C(4)H(8) to barrierlessly generate the three-membered cyclic isomer 1 CH(3)-cCHCCH-CH(3). Subsequently, 1 undergoes a ring-opening process to form the chainlike isomer 3a cis-trans-CH(3)CHCCHCH(3), which can either lead to P(6)((2)CH(3)CHCCCH(3) + (2)H) via the C-H bond cleavage or to P(7)((2)CH(3)CHCCH + (2)CH(3)) via C-C bond rupture. These two paths are the most favorable channels of the title reaction. Other channels leading to products P(1)((2)CH(3)-cCHCCH + (2)CH(3)), P(2)((2)CH(3)-cCHCC-CH(3) + (2)H), P(3)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(4)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCH + (2)C(2)H(3)), P(5)((3)CH(3)CH + (1)CH(3)CCH), P(8)(cis-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(9)(trans-(2)CH(3)CHCHCCH(2) + (2)H), P(10)((2)CH(3)CCCH(2) + (2)CH(3)), and P(11)((2)CH(3)CHCCHCH(2) + (2)H), however, are much less competitive due to either kinetic or thermodynamic factors. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the C((3)P) + trans-C(4)H(8) reaction all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, as is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

The NHC esters are also effective. Tuning the reaction conditions for NHC transfer can give either mono- or bis-NHCs, or bis- and tris-NHCs. A net N to C rearrangement of the N-alkyl imidazole complex to the corresponding NHC complex was seen with (MeO)2CO (DMC). DFT calculations identify the steps needed to form the carboxylate from imidazole and DMC: SN2 methyl transfer from DMC to imidazole, followed by proton transfer from the imidazolium CH to the carboxylate counterion, produces the free NHC H-bonded to MeOH with a weakly associated CO2. The nucleophilic NHC attacks CO2 to form NHC-CO2. NHC transfer to the metal with loss of CO2 has been calculated for Rh(cod)Cl. A proposed two-cis-site reactivity model rationalizes the experimental data: two such vacant sites at the metal are needed to allow coordination of the NHC-CO2 carboxylate and subsequent CC cleavage with NHC transfer. Partial cod decoordination or chloride loss is thus required for Rh(cod)Cl. Chloride dissociation, calculated to be easier in polar solvent, is confirmed experimentally from the retarding effect of excess chloride.",

In this study, we have used the oocyte expression system to determine whether the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporters (KCCs) can also transport NH4(+) and whether they play a role in pH regulation. Our results demonstrate that all of the CCCs examined (NKCC1, NKCC2, KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4) can promote NH4(+) translocation, presumably through binding of the ion at the K(+) site. Moreover, kinetic studies for both NKCCs and KCCs suggest that NH4(+) is an excellent surrogate of Rb(+) or K(+) and that NH4(+) transport and cellular acidification resulting from CCC activity are relevant physiologically. In this study, we have also found that CCCs are strongly and differentially affected by changes in intracellular pH (independently of intracellular [NH4(+)]). Indeed, NKCC2, KCC1, KCC2, and KCC3 are inhibited at intracellular pH &lt;7.5, whereas KCC4 is activated. These results indicate that certain CCC isoforms may be specialized to operate in acidic environments.

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations. The rate constant for the oxygen addition to CCl3 radicals was determined by pulse radiolysis to 3.3 X 10(9) M-1 s-1.

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO. For the mixed valence CcO, starting from the [FeOO] complex, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound I of the oxo heme.

The intermediate subsequently decomposes to eventually yield a mixture of cystine, higher oxides of Cys, and other uncharacterized species. Spectral titrations, transitory (1)H NMR and UV-vis spectra, and the reaction properties of the intermediate are consistent with a formulation of N,N'-dichlorocystine {NDC = [-SCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)](2)}. The reaction of equimolar amounts of HOCl with cystine at pH 11.3 does not yield N-chlorocystine [NCC = (-O2C)(H3N+)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)] but rather a 1:1 mixture of NDC and cystine. This result could be explained by two mechanisms: rapid disproportionation of NCC to produce NDC and cystine or a faster reaction of the second equivalent of HOCl with NCC than the first equivalent of HOCl reacts with cystine. The latter mechanism is favored because of our observation by NMR spectroscopy that NDC decomposes via a species that we have assigned as NCC. Thus, disproportionation of NCC is apparently a relatively slow process. The rates of reaction of cystine(0) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](2) degrees , cystine(1-) = [((-)O(2)C)(H(2)N)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](-), and cystine(2-) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH2)(CO2)(-))]2(2-) have been investigated, and it is clear that cystine(0) is unreactive, whereas cystine(2-) is about four times more reactive than cystine(1-). Accordingly, the following mechanism is proposed (constants for 5 degrees C): HOCl = H+ + OCl-, pK1 = 7.47; cystine(0) = cystine(1-) + H+, pK2 = 8.15; cystine(1-) = cystine(2-) + H+, pK3 = 9.00; cystine(1-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(1-) + H2O, k4 = 4.3(2) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1); cystine(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(2)(-) + H2O, k5 = 1.6(2) x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1); NCC(1-) --&gt; NCC(2-) + H+, k6 = fast; NCC(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NDC(2-) + H2O, k7 = fast. At physiologic pH, the k4 pathway dominates.

The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

HCN, HCCN, and NO reaction products were directly detected. In some experiments, (15)N(18)O reagent was included in the reaction mixtures in order to suppress possible secondary chemistry due to NCO radicals. Several other possible secondary reactions were also investigated and found to be very slow. The resulting product branching fractions of φ(1a) = 0.98 ± 0.07 for NO + HCCN and φ(1b) ≤ 0.07 for HCN + NCO, respectively, were obtained at 298 K. The potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction was calculated by ab initio methods at several levels of coupled-cluster theory.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of CH to the terminal C atom of CH(3)CCH, forming CH(3)CCHCH 1 (1a,1b). Starting from 1 (1a,1b), the most feasible pathway is the ring closure of 1a to CH(3)-cCCHCH 2 followed by dissociation to P                         (                            3                         )(CH(3)-cCCCH+H), or a 2,3 H shift in 1a to form CH(3)CHCCH 3 followed by C-H bond cleavage to form P                         (                            5                         )(CH(2)CHCCH+H), or a 1,2 H-shift in 1 (1a, 1b) to form CH(3)CCCH(2)                         4 followed by C-H bond fission to form P                         (                            6                         )(CH(2)CCCH(2)+H).

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO. For the mixed valence CcO, starting from the [FeOO] complex, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound I of the oxo heme.

O(2)(a) adds across a bond at the site of the negative charge, resulting in the cleavage of this bond and the O=O bond. Oxyanions react through a hydride transfer to produce their major products. Proton transfer within these product ion-dipole complexes can occur, where the final branching ratios reflect the basicity of the resulting anions. Several of these anions (CF(3)(-), HC(2)(-), CH(3)OC(O)CH(2)(-)) were also found to undergo several sequential reactions within a single encounter. These three basic types of mechanisms are supported by calculations; a potential energy diagram for each type of reaction has been calculated.

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

The NHC esters are also effective. Tuning the reaction conditions for NHC transfer can give either mono- or bis-NHCs, or bis- and tris-NHCs. A net N to C rearrangement of the N-alkyl imidazole complex to the corresponding NHC complex was seen with (MeO)2CO (DMC). DFT calculations identify the steps needed to form the carboxylate from imidazole and DMC: SN2 methyl transfer from DMC to imidazole, followed by proton transfer from the imidazolium CH to the carboxylate counterion, produces the free NHC H-bonded to MeOH with a weakly associated CO2. The nucleophilic NHC attacks CO2 to form NHC-CO2. NHC transfer to the metal with loss of CO2 has been calculated for Rh(cod)Cl. A proposed two-cis-site reactivity model rationalizes the experimental data: two such vacant sites at the metal are needed to allow coordination of the NHC-CO2 carboxylate and subsequent CC cleavage with NHC transfer. Partial cod decoordination or chloride loss is thus required for Rh(cod)Cl. Chloride dissociation, calculated to be easier in polar solvent, is confirmed experimentally from the retarding effect of excess chloride.",

Isolation of bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and identification of bis(trifluoromethyl)trioxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3.\nThe synthesis of CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 is accomplished by the photolysis of a mixture of (CF3CO)2O, CO, and O2. Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2. Its characterization is discussed along with a possible mechanism for formation and decomposition reactions.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-).

Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III).

From the value of k(OH + HFE-7500) an estimate of 2.2 years for the atmospheric lifetime of HFE-7500 is obtained. Two competing loss mechanisms for n-C3F7-CF(OCHO.CH3)CF(CF3)2 radicals were identified in 700 Torr of N2/O2 diluent at 295 K; reaction with O2 and decomposition via C-C bond scission with kO2/k(decomp) = 0.013+/-0.006 Torr(-1). The Cl atom initiated oxidation of HFE-7500 in N2/O2 diluent gives n-C3F7CF(OC(O)CH3)CF(CF3)2 as the major product and n-C3F7CF(OC(O)H)CF(CF3)2 as a minor product. The atmospheric oxidation of HFE-7500 gives n-C3F7-CF(OC(O)CH3)CF(CF3)2 and n-C3F7CF(OC(O)H)CF(CF3)2 as oxidation products.

The NHC esters are also effective. Tuning the reaction conditions for NHC transfer can give either mono- or bis-NHCs, or bis- and tris-NHCs. A net N to C rearrangement of the N-alkyl imidazole complex to the corresponding NHC complex was seen with (MeO)2CO (DMC). DFT calculations identify the steps needed to form the carboxylate from imidazole and DMC: SN2 methyl transfer from DMC to imidazole, followed by proton transfer from the imidazolium CH to the carboxylate counterion, produces the free NHC H-bonded to MeOH with a weakly associated CO2. The nucleophilic NHC attacks CO2 to form NHC-CO2. NHC transfer to the metal with loss of CO2 has been calculated for Rh(cod)Cl. A proposed two-cis-site reactivity model rationalizes the experimental data: two such vacant sites at the metal are needed to allow coordination of the NHC-CO2 carboxylate and subsequent CC cleavage with NHC transfer. Partial cod decoordination or chloride loss is thus required for Rh(cod)Cl. Chloride dissociation, calculated to be easier in polar solvent, is confirmed experimentally from the retarding effect of excess chloride.",

The NHC esters are also effective. Tuning the reaction conditions for NHC transfer can give either mono- or bis-NHCs, or bis- and tris-NHCs. A net N to C rearrangement of the N-alkyl imidazole complex to the corresponding NHC complex was seen with (MeO)2CO (DMC). DFT calculations identify the steps needed to form the carboxylate from imidazole and DMC: SN2 methyl transfer from DMC to imidazole, followed by proton transfer from the imidazolium CH to the carboxylate counterion, produces the free NHC H-bonded to MeOH with a weakly associated CO2. The nucleophilic NHC attacks CO2 to form NHC-CO2. NHC transfer to the metal with loss of CO2 has been calculated for Rh(cod)Cl. A proposed two-cis-site reactivity model rationalizes the experimental data: two such vacant sites at the metal are needed to allow coordination of the NHC-CO2 carboxylate and subsequent CC cleavage with NHC transfer. Partial cod decoordination or chloride loss is thus required for Rh(cod)Cl. Chloride dissociation, calculated to be easier in polar solvent, is confirmed experimentally from the retarding effect of excess chloride.",

Presently known organic noble gas compounds have a coordination number of two at most. The Ng(-C[triple bond]CH)(4) molecules have D(4h) symmetry, and Ng(-C[triple bond]CH)(6) molecules have O(h) symmetry. The bonding in all these compounds is partly ionic and partly covalent, with significant contributions from both types of bonding. The relatively high vibrational frequencies and the substantial Ng-(C[triple bond]CH) binding energy in these species indicate that these compounds should be fairly stable, at least in cryogenic conditions. These compounds could be a very interesting addition to the range of known organic noble gas compounds. Suggestions are made on possible approaches to their preparation.",

A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations. The rate constant for the oxygen addition to CCl3 radicals was determined by pulse radiolysis to 3.3 X 10(9) M-1 s-1. Possible reaction mechanisms leading to the observed end products are discussed.",

Molecular weight determinations indicated mononuclear nature of the complexes. LMCT bands were observed in the electronic spectra. Infrared spectra suggested bidentate nature of the ligands. Fluorescent behaviour of the complexes was noticed on the basis of fluorescence spectra. Powder XRD indicated them to be semi-crystalline having the crystallite size in 136-185 nm range. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicated spherical particles of ~ 200 nm diameter. On the basis of physico-chemical studies, it is suggested that titanium is having coordination number 7 or 8 in these complexes.",

These anions provide access to the corresponding neutral reactive intermediates: the OCCO diradical and the HOCCO and OHCCO radicals. Contrasting the straightforward deprotonation pathway in the reaction of O(-) with glyoxal (OHCCHO), which is expected to yield glyoxalide (OHCCO(-)), OHCCO(-) is shown to be a minor product, with HOCCO(-) being the dominant observed isomer of the m/z = 57 anion. In the HOCCO/OHCCO anion photoelectron spectrum, we identify several electronic states of this radical system and determine the adiabatic electron affinity of HOCCO as 1.763(6) eV. This result is compared to the corresponding 1.936(8) eV value for ethylenedione (OCCO), reported in our recent study of this transient diradical [A. R. Dixon, T. Xue, and A. Sanov, Angew.

The NHC esters are also effective. Tuning the reaction conditions for NHC transfer can give either mono- or bis-NHCs, or bis- and tris-NHCs. A net N to C rearrangement of the N-alkyl imidazole complex to the corresponding NHC complex was seen with (MeO)2CO (DMC). DFT calculations identify the steps needed to form the carboxylate from imidazole and DMC: SN2 methyl transfer from DMC to imidazole, followed by proton transfer from the imidazolium CH to the carboxylate counterion, produces the free NHC H-bonded to MeOH with a weakly associated CO2. The nucleophilic NHC attacks CO2 to form NHC-CO2. NHC transfer to the metal with loss of CO2 has been calculated for Rh(cod)Cl. A proposed two-cis-site reactivity model rationalizes the experimental data: two such vacant sites at the metal are needed to allow coordination of the NHC-CO2 carboxylate and subsequent CC cleavage with NHC transfer. Partial cod decoordination or chloride loss is thus required for Rh(cod)Cl. Chloride dissociation, calculated to be easier in polar solvent, is confirmed experimentally from the retarding effect of excess chloride.",

After 3 days of heating under hydrothermal conditions, the reaction between KI and CuCN produces [Cu(II)(OH(2))(4)][Cu(I)(2)(CN)I(2)](2) (VII), in which the CuCN chains are broken into single Cu-CN-Cu units, which in turn are linked into chains via iodine atoms and then into layers via long Cu-C and Cu-Cu interactions.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

HCN, HCCN, and NO reaction products were directly detected. In some experiments, (15)N(18)O reagent was included in the reaction mixtures in order to suppress possible secondary chemistry due to NCO radicals. Several other possible secondary reactions were also investigated and found to be very slow. The resulting product branching fractions of φ(1a) = 0.98 ± 0.07 for NO + HCCN and φ(1b) ≤ 0.07 for HCN + NCO, respectively, were obtained at 298 K. The potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction was calculated by ab initio methods at several levels of coupled-cluster theory.

Experimental studies with the 13C labeled analogues indicate that the loss of C occurs subsequent to or accompanying partial carbon scrambling of the CCCN backbone.

The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O2COH)]ZnCl(4).3H2O is isolated as a crystalline solid from an acidic solution of the parent carbonate [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4, and X-ray structural analysis shows that lengthening of the C=Oexo bond and shortening of the C-Oendo bond accompanies protonation. The bimetallic complex [Co(Me-tpa)O2COZnCl3] results from the unexpected coordination of ZnCl3- to the exo O atom of a chelated carbonate ligand. This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution. The trimetallic complex [Co(trpyn)O2COZn(OH2)4OCO2Co(trpyn)](ZnCl4)2.H2O crystallises on prolonged standing of [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4 in a neutral solution having [Zn2+]=1.0 M. The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom. They also show that such coordination of Zn2+ decreases the C-Oexo bond order.",

A comparison of the charge reversal (-CR+) and neutralization/reionization (-NR+) mass spectra of [CCCN]- indicate that neutral C3N species (formed by charge stripping of the anion) decompose by loss of C. Experimental studies with the 13C labeled analogues indicate that the loss of C occurs subsequent to or accompanying partial carbon scrambling of the CCCN backbone. Theoretical studies suggest that this scrambling may occur during equilibration of CCCN and CCNC via a decomposing \"rhombic\" C3N intermediate.",

HCN, HCCN, and NO reaction products were directly detected. In some experiments, (15)N(18)O reagent was included in the reaction mixtures in order to suppress possible secondary chemistry due to NCO radicals. Several other possible secondary reactions were also investigated and found to be very slow. The resulting product branching fractions of φ(1a) = 0.98 ± 0.07 for NO + HCCN and φ(1b) ≤ 0.07 for HCN + NCO, respectively, were obtained at 298 K. The potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction was calculated by ab initio methods at several levels of coupled-cluster theory. The calculations show pathways to channels (1a) and (1b) with nearly identical energetics and a substantial dependence on the level of theory used, suggesting that multireference calculations are needed to accurately predict the experimental results.",

The NHC esters are also effective. Tuning the reaction conditions for NHC transfer can give either mono- or bis-NHCs, or bis- and tris-NHCs. A net N to C rearrangement of the N-alkyl imidazole complex to the corresponding NHC complex was seen with (MeO)2CO (DMC). DFT calculations identify the steps needed to form the carboxylate from imidazole and DMC: SN2 methyl transfer from DMC to imidazole, followed by proton transfer from the imidazolium CH to the carboxylate counterion, produces the free NHC H-bonded to MeOH with a weakly associated CO2. The nucleophilic NHC attacks CO2 to form NHC-CO2. NHC transfer to the metal with loss of CO2 has been calculated for Rh(cod)Cl. A proposed two-cis-site reactivity model rationalizes the experimental data: two such vacant sites at the metal are needed to allow coordination of the NHC-CO2 carboxylate and subsequent CC cleavage with NHC transfer. Partial cod decoordination or chloride loss is thus required for Rh(cod)Cl. Chloride dissociation, calculated to be easier in polar solvent, is confirmed experimentally from the retarding effect of excess chloride.",

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO.

O-[methyl-C]vanillate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzoate) was used as the labeled C(1) substrate. The data showed that for every O-methyl carbon converted to [C]acetate, two were oxidized to CO(2).

DFT calculations were used to determine the nature of the bonding for the Ti=NNCPh2 moiety in 8 and in the previously reported [Cp2Ti(NNCPh2)(PMe3)].

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

The UVC-photolysis (254 nm) of H2O2 added to aqueous solutions of CCl4 is leading to the homolysis of the oxidant yielding hydroxyl radicals (HO) that subsequently react with added methanol to generate hydroxymethyl radicals (CH2OH). The latter radicals initiate mineralization of CCl4 by reductive C-Cl bond splitting. CHCl3, C2Cl4 and C2Cl6 were found as reaction intermediates, but are quantitatively depleted in a parallel oxidative reaction manifold leading to mineralization. Carbon dioxide radical anion, CO2(-), an intermediate in the mineralization pathway of methanol, is also shown to initiate the mineralization of CCl4 by reductive dechlorination. A reaction mechanism is proposed and validated with computer simulations of all the experimental results.",

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO. For the mixed valence CcO, starting from the [FeOO] complex, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound I of the oxo heme.

These anions provide access to the corresponding neutral reactive intermediates: the OCCO diradical and the HOCCO and OHCCO radicals. Contrasting the straightforward deprotonation pathway in the reaction of O(-) with glyoxal (OHCCHO), which is expected to yield glyoxalide (OHCCO(-)), OHCCO(-) is shown to be a minor product, with HOCCO(-) being the dominant observed isomer of the m/z = 57 anion. In the HOCCO/OHCCO anion photoelectron spectrum, we identify several electronic states of this radical system and determine the adiabatic electron affinity of HOCCO as 1.763(6) eV. This result is compared to the corresponding 1.936(8) eV value for ethylenedione (OCCO), reported in our recent study of this transient diradical [A. R. Dixon, T. Xue, and A. Sanov, Angew.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons. The crystal structures of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), p-ClC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) and p-BrC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) were determined by X-ray crystallography using single crystals. The coordination around the phosphorus center in these compounds is best described as distorted tetrahedral and the P(O) and C(O) groups are anti with respect to each other. In the compound Br-C(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) (with two independent molecules in the unit cell), two conformers are connected to each other via two different N-H...O hydrogen bonds forming a non-centrosymmetric dimer. In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

XAFS and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) analysis imply that besides ZnCl(3)(-) and Zn(2)Cl(5)(-) anions, the Cl-Zn-Cl ion pair is a main species in the ionic liquid at higher x(ZnCl(2)). This newly discovered Zn species has substantial influence on the properties of the ionic liquid. From the analysis of the coordination numbers and coordination distance, a new mechanism of interactions between Ch(+) cation and Cl-Zn-Cl ion pairs or Cl(-) is proposed.",

In contrast to transition metal catalysis, the alkenes are not activated by metal-alkene orbital interactions. Instead it is proposed that alkene activation proceeds through an electrostatic interaction with a Lewis acidic Ca(2+) . The role of the metal was evaluated by a study using the metal-free catalysts: [Ph2 N(-) ][Me4 N(+) ] and [Ph3 C(-) ][Me4 N(+) ]. These \"naked\" amides and carbanions can act as catalysts in the conversion of activated double bonds (CO and CN) in the hydroamination of ArNCO and RNCNR (R=alkyl) by Ph2 NH. For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination. The influence of the cation in catalysis is further evaluated by a DFT study. ",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO.

The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The association of CCO with NO2 was found to be a barrierless process forming an energy-rich adduct a (OCCNO2) followed by oxygen shift to give b (O2CCNO). Our results show that the product P1 (CO2 + CNO) is the major product with absolute yield, while the product P4 (2CO + NO) is the minor product with less abundance. The other products may be undetectable. The product P1 (CO2 + CNO) can be obtained through R --&gt; a --&gt; b --&gt; P1 (CO2 + CNO), whereas the product P4 (2CO + NO) can be obtained through two channels R --&gt; a--&gt; b --&gt; c --&gt; (d, g) --&gt; P2 (OCNO + CO) --&gt; P4 (2CO + NO) and R --&gt; a --&gt; b --&gt; f --&gt; P3 (c-OCC-O + NO) --&gt; P4 (2CO + NO).

It was shown that CCl3 radicals add oxygen to form CCl3O2 radicals, which eventually yield three chloride ions and CO2. A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations. The rate constant for the oxygen addition to CCl3 radicals was determined by pulse radiolysis to 3.3 X 10(9) M-1 s-1.

The base-promoted eliminations from 1 proceeded by the E2 mechanism when Y = Cl, CF3, and NO2.

The values of beta = 0.14 and beta(lg) = 0.10-0.21 calculated for elimination from 1 (Y = NO2) indicate a reactant-like transition state with small extents of proton transfer and C(alpha)-OAr bond cleavage. The extent of proton transfer increased with a poorer leaving group, and the degree of leaving group bond cleavage increased with a weaker base.

For the intramolecular hydroamination of unactivated CC bonds in H2 CCHCH2 CPh2 CH2 NH2 the presence of a metal cation is crucial. A new type of hybrid catalyst consisting of a strong organic Schwesinger base and a simple metal salt can act as catalyst for the intramolecular alkene hydroamination.

In some experiments, isotopically labeled (18)O2, (15)N(18)O and C2D6 reagents were included into the photolysis mixture in order to suppress and/or isotopically label possible secondary reactions. HCN, OC(18)O, C(18)O, NCO, DCN, and NH molecules were detected upon laser photolysis of HCNO/reagents/buffer gas mixtures.

Corresponding reactants, products, intermediates, and interconversion and dissociation transition states are located on the reaction potential energy profiles. Computation results show that in the reaction of CP with CH(2)CCH(2) the dominant reaction product should be species CH(2)CCHCP. Also, we can suggest species HCCCH(2)CP as a secondary reaction product despite of only minor contribution to reaction products. In the reaction of CP with CH(3)CCH, the primary and secondary products are suggested to be two important molecules HCCCP and CH(3)CCCP, respectively. The predicted mechanisms for the two reactions are not in parallel with the reactions of CN with allene CH(2)CCH(2) and methylacetylene CH(3)CCH given in previous studies.

With the H atom, for comparison, the reaction [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + H((2)S)] evolves along the PES of the X(2)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN(-) (or HNC(-)) until the crossing with the X(1)Σ(+) electronic ground state of HCN (or HNC), where electron detachment occurs. The process is rather similar to the two halogen atoms F and Cl, with some differences due to the larger electron affinity of the halogens, making possible the existence of ClCN(-) in a (2)Σ(+) state. The reaction of CN(-) with O and S atoms proceeds via a multistep mechanism. The lowest electronic state at long distance, the (3)Π state arising from the [CN(-)((1)Σ(+)) + O/S((3)P)] reaction channel, does not correlate with the X(1)Σ(+) ground state of the XCN(-) anion (X = O or S).

For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place. For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed. The gas-phase proton affinity of L shows instructive correlations with structural parameters and energy gaps for the investigated reactions.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Collision induced dissociations of these anions, together with calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory indicate that the anions do not rearrange under conditions used to charge strip them to their neutrals. A comparison of the charge reversal (-CR+) and neutralization/reionization (-NR+) mass spectra of [CCCN]- indicate that neutral C3N species (formed by charge stripping of the anion) decompose by loss of C. Experimental studies with the 13C labeled analogues indicate that the loss of C occurs subsequent to or accompanying partial carbon scrambling of the CCCN backbone. Theoretical studies suggest that this scrambling may occur during equilibration of CCCN and CCNC via a decomposing \"rhombic\" C3N intermediate.",

A total of nine kinds of dissociation products, including P(1) (HCN + C(2)H(4)(+)), P(2) (HCNCHCH(2)(+) + H), P(3) (NCCH(2) + CH(3)(+)), P(4) (CN + C(2)H(5)(+)), P(5) (NCCHCH(2)(+) + H(2)), P(6) (HNCCHCH(2)(+) + H), P(7) (c-CHCCH(2)N(+) + H(2)), P(8) (c-NHCCH(2)C(+) + H(2)), and P(9) (HNCCCH(+) + H(2) + H), are obtained. Among the nine products, P(1) is the most abundant product. P(2) is the second feasible product but is much less competitive than P(1). P(3), P(4), P(5), and P(6) may have the lowest yields observed. Other products, P(7), P(8), and P(9), may become feasible at high temperature. Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the most favorable pathway all lie below the reactant, the HCN(+) + C(2)H(4) reaction is expected to be rapid, which is confirmed by experiment. The present calculation results may provide a useful guide for understanding the mechanism of HCN(+) toward other unsaturated hydrocarbons.",

The reaction was monitored spectroscopically and by high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with the aim to elucidate mechanistic aspects. NaOCl reacts with 1 in acetonitrile to form the transient species [(L)Ni(II)-OCl(S)](+) (A) (L = (Me,H)PyTACN, S = solvent), which was identified by ESI-MS. UV/vis absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance, and resonance Raman spectroscopy indicate that intermediate A decays to the complex [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) presumably through homolytic cleavage of the O-Cl bond, which liberates a Cl(•) atom. Hydrolysis of acetonitrile to acetic acid under the applied conditions results in the formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (C), which undergoes subsequent reduction to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](2+) (D), presumably via reaction with OCl(-) or ClO2(-). Subsequent addition of NaOCl to [(L)Ni(II)-OOCCH3(S)](+) (D) regenerates [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) to a much greater extent and at a faster rate. Addition of acids such as acetic and triflic acid enhances the rate and extent of formation of [(L)Ni(III)-OH(S)](2+) (B) from 1, suggesting that O-Cl homolytic cleavage is accelerated by protonation. Overall, these reactions generate Cl(•) atoms and ClO2 in a catalytic cycle where the nickel center alternates between Ni(II) and Ni(III). Chlorine atoms in turn react with the C-H bonds of alkanes, forming alkyl radicals that are trapped by Cl(•) to form alkyl chlorides. ",

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms.

The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

C2 carbon as the most probable site of attack and C3 as the least probable one are proposed.",

The majority of neutrals H2CCCCO are stable for the microsecond duration of the NR experiment, but some are energized and decompose to give H2CCC and CO. A similar NR+ experiment with [HCCCCDO]-. yields neutrals HCCCCDO, some of which are excited and rearrange. Calculations show that it is the singlet form of HCCCCHO which rearranges (the singlet lies 36 kJ mol-1 above the ground state triplet): the rearrangement occurs by the sequential H transfer process, HCCCCHO--&gt;HCC(CH)CO&lt;--H2CCCCO.

The complete reaction consists of an associative binding of one H(2)O from the second coordination sphere leading to a six-coordinate intermediate [Zn(H(2)O)(5)(L)](2+)·H(2)O, followed by the dissociation of a water molecule to reach the product state [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O. For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place. For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed. The gas-phase proton affinity of L shows instructive correlations with structural parameters and energy gaps for the investigated reactions.",

Alcohols are selectively acylated in the presence of amines by cooperative carbene catalysis. Quantum chemical calculations support the suggested mechanism.",
