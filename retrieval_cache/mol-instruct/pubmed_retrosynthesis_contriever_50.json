Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

Density functional calculations on a simplified model system suggest that the reactions occur through oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(III) species followed by C(carbene)-halogen reductive eliminations from NHC Cu(III) halide complexes. Remarkably short C(carbene)-chloride contacts and rare interactions between the chloride lone pair electrons and the C(carbene)p(π) orbital were found for the calculated NHC Cu(III) chlorides.

The CH3C(O)OCH2O* radical is formed during the Cl atom initiated oxidation of ethylene glycol diacetate, and two loss mechanisms were identified: reaction with O2 to give CH3C(O)OC(O)H and alpha-ester rearrangement to give CH3C(O)OH and HC(O) radicals. The reaction of CH3C(O)OCH2O2* with NO gives chemically activated CH3C(O)OCH2O* radicals which are more likely to undergo decomposition via the alpha-ester rearrangement than CH3C(O)OCH2O* radicals produced in the peroxy radical self-reaction.",

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The other products may be undetectable. The product P1 (CO2 + CNO) can be obtained through R --&gt; a --&gt; b --&gt; P1 (CO2 + CNO), whereas the product P4 (2CO + NO) can be obtained through two channels R --&gt; a--&gt; b --&gt; c --&gt; (d, g) --&gt; P2 (OCNO + CO) --&gt; P4 (2CO + NO) and R --&gt; a --&gt; b --&gt; f --&gt; P3 (c-OCC-O + NO) --&gt; P4 (2CO + NO).

Two different experimental arrangements have been used. Arrangement A consisted of a laser-flash photolysis set up combined with quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and allowed the determination of the stable products at 4 mbar. The c-C5H9 radicals were produced via the reaction c-C5H10 + Cl with chlorine atoms from the photolysis of CFCl3; the O atoms were generated by photolysis of SO2. Arrangement B, a conventional discharge flow-reactor with molecular beam sampling, was used to determine the rate coefficient. Here, the hydrocarbon radicals (c-C5H9, C2H5, CH2OCH3) were produced via the reaction of atomic fluorine with c-C5H10, C2H6, and CH3OCH3, respectively, and detected by mass spectrometry after laser photoionization. For the c-C5H9 + O reaction, the relative contributions of intermediate formation (c-C5H9O) and direct abstraction (c-C5H8 + OH) were found to be 68 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 4%, respectively. The decomposition products of the chemically activated intermediate could be identified, and the following relative branching fractions were obtained: c-C5H8O + H (31 +/- 2%), CH2CH(CH2)2CHO + H (40 +/- 5%), 2 C2H4 + H + CO (17 +/- 5%), and C3H4O + C2H4 + H (12 +/- 5%). Additionally, the product formation of the c-C5H8 + O reaction was studied, and the following relative yields were obtained (mol %): C2H4, 24%; C3H4O, 18%; c-C5H8O, 30%; c-C5H8O, 23%; 4-pentenal, 5%. The rate coefficient of the c-C5H9 + O reaction was determined relative to the reactions C2H5 + O and CH3OCH2 + O leading to k = (1.73 +/- 0.05) x 10(14) cm3 mol(-1) s(-1). The experimental branching fractions are analyzed in terms of statistical rate theory with molecular and transition-state data from quantum chemical calculations, and high-pressure limiting Arrhenius parameters for the unimolecular decomposition reactions of C5H9O species are derived.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Several of these anions (CF(3)(-), HC(2)(-), CH(3)OC(O)CH(2)(-)) were also found to undergo several sequential reactions within a single encounter. These three basic types of mechanisms are supported by calculations; a potential energy diagram for each type of reaction has been calculated. Additionally, six of these reactions had been qualitatively studied before; our results are in agreement with previous data.",

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO. For the mixed valence CcO, starting from the [FeOO] complex, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound I of the oxo heme. For the fully reduced CcO, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound II of the oxo heme which is a reduced state of the compound I.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO.

Compound 8 was prepared from [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(NtBu)] and Ph2CNNH2. DFT calculations were used to determine the nature of the bonding for the Ti=NNCPh2 moiety in 8 and in the previously reported [Cp2Ti(NNCPh2)(PMe3)]. Reaction of 8 with CO2 gave dimeric [(Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{μ-OC(NNCPh2)O})2] and the \"double-insertion\" dicarboxylate species [Cp*Ti-{MeC(NiPr)2}{OC(O)N(NCPh2)C(O)O}] through an initial [2+2] cycloaddition product [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{N(NCPh2)C(O)O}], the congener of which could be isolated in the corresponding reaction with CS2.

The reaction proceeds with C-N bond cleavage in the carbinolamine intermediate, shows excellent functional group tolerance, and delivers the alcohol products in very high yields. The expected C-O cleavage products are not formed under the reaction conditions. The observed reactivity is opposite to the electrophilicity of polar carbonyl groups resulting from the n(X) → π*(C═O) (X = O, N) conjugation. Mechanistic studies suggest that coordination of Sm to the carbonyl and then to Lewis basic nitrogen in the tetrahedral intermediate facilitate electron transfer and control the selectivity of the C-N/C-O cleavage. Notably, the method provides direct access to acyl-type radicals from unactivated amides under mild electron transfer conditions.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

They react with AgClO4 and the appropriate neutral ligand or with [Ag(NH=CMe2)2]ClO4 to give [Ir(Cp*)(R-imam)L](ClO4)2 (R = H, L = (t)BuNC (20), XyNC (21); R = Me, L = MeCN (22)) or [Ir(Cp*)(H-imam)(NH=CMe2)](ClO4)2 (23a), respectively. The later reacts with PPNCl to give [Ir(Cp*)(H-imam)(NH=CMe2)]Cl(ClO4) (23b). The reaction of 22 with XyNC gives [Ir(Cp*)(Me-imam)(CNXy)](ClO4)2 (24). The structures of complexes 15, 16c and 18b have been solved by X-ray diffraction methods.",

The calculated results show that the title reaction mainly occurs through the singlet oxygen-to-oxygen coupling mechanism with the formation of entrance tetroxide intermediates, and the most dominant product is C(2)H(5)O + HO(2) + CH(3)CHO (P5) generated in channel R5. Beginning from the radical products of P5 (C(2)H(5)O, HO(2)) and reactant (C(2)H(5)O(2)), five secondary reactions HO(2) + HO(2) (a), HO(2) + C(2)H(5)O (b), C(2)H(5)O + C(2)H(5)O (c), HO(2) + C(2)H(5)O(2) (d), and C(2)H(5)O + C(2)H(5)O(2) (e) mainly proceed on the triplet potential energy surface.

The thermal rate coefficients for the formation of three major products, CS + SO ((3)Σ(-)), OCS + S ((3)P) and CO + S(2) ((3)Σ(-)(g)) were computed by using transition state and RRKM statistical rate theories over the temperature range of 200-2000 K.

Although this reaction is typically assumed to form hydroperoxides as the major products (R1a), acetyl peroxy radicals and acetonyl peroxy radicals have been shown to undergo other reactions (R1b) and (R1c) with substantial branching ratios: RO(2) + HO(2) → ROOH + O(2) (R1a), RO(2) + HO(2) → ROH + O(3) (R1b), RO(2) + HO(2) → RO + OH + O(2) (R1c). Theoretical work suggests that reactions (R1b) and (R1c) may be a general feature of acyl peroxy and α-carbonyl peroxy radicals. In this work, branching ratios for R1a-R1c were derived for six carbonyl-containing peroxy radicals: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), and CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO. Branching ratios for reactions of Cl-atoms with butanal, butanone, methacrolein, and methyl vinyl ketone were also measured as a part of this work. Product yields were determined using a combination of long path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The following branching ratios were determined: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.35 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0.25 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.4 ± 0.1; C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.24 ± 0.15, Y(R1b) = 0.29 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.47 ± 0.15; CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.75 ± 0.13, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.25 ± 0.13; CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.42 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.58 ± 0.1; CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO, Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.2, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2; and CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2.

DFT calculations were used to determine the nature of the bonding for the Ti=NNCPh2 moiety in 8 and in the previously reported [Cp2Ti(NNCPh2)(PMe3)].

Ab initio calculations are presented for CCN+ and CNC+; a saddle point for the reaction CCN+ --&gt; CNC+ is calculated to be 195 kJ mol-1 above the CNC+.  The results provide evidence that the more reactive CCN+ isomer is unlikely to be present in measurable densities in interstellar clouds.",

Although CO was also detected, its generation could be attributed to subsequent reactions of OCSe with O atoms. The corresponding reaction for O + SCSe gives OCS and OCSe as observable products, with their yields given as 32.2 +/- 4.5 and 30.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively. Computational studies using UB3LYP/aug-cc-PVTZ methods have been used particularly to determine the reaction pathways for the channels in which OCS or OCSe is produced.",

Interestingly, only regioisomers 2a-d with the oxygen atom bonded to C4/C5 and the nitrogen atom bonded to C3/C6 are generated as demonstrated by heteronuclear multiple bond coherence (HMBC) NMR, while the alternative regioisomers 3a-d, which have the oxygen and nitrogen atoms at C3/C6 and C4/C5, respectively, are not formed from the reactions, even though the DFT (density functional theory) calculations have predicted that the energy differences between the two types of regioisomers are very small, with regioisomers 3a-d actually having lower energies than 2a-d. The results are rationalized by the charge distributions of C(61)HPh(3-), where computational calculations have shown that the negative charges on C4 and C5 are greater than those on C3 and C6, indicating that the exhibited site selectivity of heteroatoms is a result of the charge-directed addition process.",

The characterization was performed by (31)P{(1)H}, (1)H, (13)C NMR, IR spectroscopy besides (19)F NMR for fluorine containing compounds (1) and (2), and X-ray single-crystal structure analysis for (1), (3), (4) and (5). In each molecule the P atom has a distorted tetrahedral environment. The N atoms bonded to P atom have mainly sp(2) character with a very slight tendency to a pyramidal coordination for some amido groups. Different types of N-H···O hydrogen bonds have been analyzed for (1), (3), (4) and (5) and 118 other structures (including 194 hydrogen bonds) deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database, containing either C(O)-NH-P(O)[N(C)(C)]2 or C(O)-NH-P(O)[NH(C)]2. The participation of N(CP)-H···O=P [N(CP) = the nitrogen atom of the C(O)-NH-P(O) fragment], N-H···O=P, N-H···O=C and N(CP)-H···O=C hydrogen bonds in different hydrogen-bonded motifs are discussed. Moreover, the involvement of the O atoms of C=O or P=O in the [N(CP)-H][N-H]···O=P, [N-H]2···O=P, [N-H]2···O=C and [N-H]3···O=C groups are considered. A histogram of N···O distances, the distribution of N-H···O angles and the scatterplot of N-H···O angles versus N···O distances are studied.",

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO. For the mixed valence CcO, starting from the [FeOO] complex, the final products are single H(2)O molecule and compound I of the oxo heme.

Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

Unlike the comparable ring expansion of the (1)A(2) state of phenylnitrene (1b) to 1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraene (3b), ring expansion of 1c to 3c is computed to be quite endothermic.

The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated.

The determined rotational constants and the inertial defect agree well with those derived from the calculations, implying that the calculated molecular structure is reasonable.

Theoretical work suggests that reactions (R1b) and (R1c) may be a general feature of acyl peroxy and α-carbonyl peroxy radicals. In this work, branching ratios for R1a-R1c were derived for six carbonyl-containing peroxy radicals: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), and CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO.

When H(2)O is involved as a reactant, equcalcrx must be used because H(2)O is not in the stoichiometric number matrix.

Thermal decomposition of adsorbed CH(3)NO(2) species leads to the formation of two types of NCO species (NCO on Ag and NCO on Al(2)O(3)) above 298K. In order to investigate the reaction mechanism, we have designed the calculated models (a-g) for the NCO intermediate.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Unlike the comparable ring expansion of the (1)A(2) state of phenylnitrene (1b) to 1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraene (3b), ring expansion of 1c to 3c is computed to be quite endothermic. Nevertheless, cyclization of 1c, to form the bicyclic intermediate 2c in the ring expansion reaction, is computed to be only slightly more endothermic than the comparable cyclization reaction of 1b to 2b. The origins of these differences between the ring expansion reactions of 1b and 1c have been elucidated through the calculation of the energies of relevant isodesmic reactions.",

The association of CCO with NO2 was found to be a barrierless process forming an energy-rich adduct a (OCCNO2) followed by oxygen shift to give b (O2CCNO). Our results show that the product P1 (CO2 + CNO) is the major product with absolute yield, while the product P4 (2CO + NO) is the minor product with less abundance. The other products may be undetectable. The product P1 (CO2 + CNO) can be obtained through R --&gt; a --&gt; b --&gt; P1 (CO2 + CNO), whereas the product P4 (2CO + NO) can be obtained through two channels R --&gt; a--&gt; b --&gt; c --&gt; (d, g) --&gt; P2 (OCNO + CO) --&gt; P4 (2CO + NO) and R --&gt; a --&gt; b --&gt; f --&gt; P3 (c-OCC-O + NO) --&gt; P4 (2CO + NO). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the above three channels are all lower than the reactants in energy, the CCO + NO2 reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the experimental measurement in quality. The present study may be helpful for further experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

The construction of the C-N bond is of significant importance as it opens avenues for the introduction of nitrogen in organic molecules. Despite significant advancements in this field, the construction of the C-N bond is still a major challenge for organic chemists, due to the involvement of harsh reaction conditions or the use of expensive catalysts in many cases. Thus, it is a challenge to develop alternative, milder and cheaper methodologies for the construction of C-N bonds. Herein, we have selected some prime literature reports that may serve this purpose.

It was shown that CCl3 radicals add oxygen to form CCl3O2 radicals, which eventually yield three chloride ions and CO2. A constant ratio of G(Cl-)/G(CO2) = 4 is found in solutions containing 1.5 X 10(-4) M or more oxygen. Competing reactions of the CCl3 radical increase this ratio at lower oxygen concentrations.

The complete reaction consists of an associative binding of one H(2)O from the second coordination sphere leading to a six-coordinate intermediate [Zn(H(2)O)(5)(L)](2+)·H(2)O, followed by the dissociation of a water molecule to reach the product state [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O. For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place. For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed.

Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy.

The measurements have been accomplished by calibrating against the literature value of the rate coefficient for O(3P) with CS2 (4 x 10(-12) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1)). A product channel giving OCSe in 32.0 +/- 4.2% yield has been found for the O + CSe2 reaction. Although CO was also detected, its generation could be attributed to subsequent reactions of OCSe with O atoms. The corresponding reaction for O + SCSe gives OCS and OCSe as observable products, with their yields given as 32.2 +/- 4.5 and 30.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively.

In addition to the known species ClCO*, OCCl2, syn-ClC(O)SCl, syn-ClC(O)SSCl, IC(O)Cl, IC(O)Br, and syn-BrC(O)SBr, syn-iodocarbonylsulfenyl bromide, syn-IC(O)SBr, has thus been identified for the first time as a photoproduct of the reactions involving IBr. The first product to be formed in the reactions with Cl2 or ICl is the ClCO* radical which reacts subsequently with halogen or sulfur atoms or other matrix guests to give the corresponding carbonyl dihalide (OCCl2 and IC(O)Cl), syn-ClC(O)SCl or syn-ClC(O)SSCl.

We have investigated the products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 3-hexene-2,5-dione in the presence of NO at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of air using in situ atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2. Our observation of a molecular weight 102 species indicates that the CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 radical dominantly decomposes to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO plus CH3(*C)O, rather than decomposing to CH3C(O)CHO plus CH3C(O)(*C)HOH, isomerizing, or reacting with O2.

Recent calculations on the C(2)H(3)N(+*) potential energy surface have suggested that it may be difficult to generate pure CH(3)CN(+*) when ionizing acetonitrile. We have probed the interconversion of CH(3)CN(+*) and its lower energy isomer CH(2)CNH(+*) by calculation, collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry and ion-molecule reaction. The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS. CH(3)CN(+*) reacts by proton-transfer with CO(2) and charge transfer with COS, whereas CH(2)CNH(+*) is unreactive.",

O(2)(a) adds across a bond at the site of the negative charge, resulting in the cleavage of this bond and the O=O bond. Oxyanions react through a hydride transfer to produce their major products. Proton transfer within these product ion-dipole complexes can occur, where the final branching ratios reflect the basicity of the resulting anions.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Recent calculations on the C(2)H(3)N(+*) potential energy surface have suggested that it may be difficult to generate pure CH(3)CN(+*) when ionizing acetonitrile. We have probed the interconversion of CH(3)CN(+*) and its lower energy isomer CH(2)CNH(+*) by calculation, collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry and ion-molecule reaction. The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS. CH(3)CN(+*) reacts by proton-transfer with CO(2) and charge transfer with COS, whereas CH(2)CNH(+*) is unreactive.",
