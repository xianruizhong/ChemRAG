By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition.

A carbonyl condensation reaction takes place between two carbonyl partners and involves both nucleophilic addition and $\\alpha$-substitution processes. One carbonyl partner is converted by base into a nucleophilic enolate ion, which then adds to the electrophilic carbonyl group of the second partner. The first partner thus undergoes an $\\alpha$ substitution, while the second undergoes a nucleophilic addition.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { Nucleophilic } & \\text { Electrophilic } \\\\\n\\text { donor } & \\text { acceptor }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe aldol reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two aldehyde or ketone molecules. Aldol reactions are reversible, leading first to $\\beta$-hydroxy aldehydes/ketones and then to $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated products after dehydration. Mixed aldol condensations between two different aldehydes or ketones generally give a mixture of all four possible products. A mixed reaction can be successful, however, if one of the two partners is an unusually good donor (ethyl acetoacetate, for instance) or if it can act only as an acceptor (formaldehyde and benzaldehyde, for instance). Intramolecular aldol condensations of 1,4- and 1,5-diketones are also successful and provide a good way to make five- and six-membered rings.\n\nThe Claisen condensation reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two ester components and gives a $\\beta$-keto ester product. Mixed Claisen condensations between two different esters are successful only when one of the two partners has no acidic $\\alpha$ hydrogens (ethyl benzoate and ethyl formate, for instance) and thus can function only as the acceptor partner.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms.

A carbonyl condensation reaction takes place between two carbonyl partners and involves both nucleophilic addition and $\\alpha$-substitution processes. One carbonyl partner is converted by base into a nucleophilic enolate ion, which then adds to the electrophilic carbonyl group of the second partner. The first partner thus undergoes an $\\alpha$ substitution, while the second undergoes a nucleophilic addition.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\text { Nucleophilic } & \\text { Electrophilic } \\\\\n\\text { donor } & \\text { acceptor }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe aldol reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two aldehyde or ketone molecules. Aldol reactions are reversible, leading first to $\\beta$-hydroxy aldehydes/ketones and then to $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated products after dehydration. Mixed aldol condensations between two different aldehydes or ketones generally give a mixture of all four possible products. A mixed reaction can be successful, however, if one of the two partners is an unusually good donor (ethyl acetoacetate, for instance) or if it can act only as an acceptor (formaldehyde and benzaldehyde, for instance). Intramolecular aldol condensations of 1,4- and 1,5-diketones are also successful and provide a good way to make five- and six-membered rings.\n\nThe Claisen condensation reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two ester components and gives a $\\beta$-keto ester product. Mixed Claisen condensations between two different esters are successful only when one of the two partners has no acidic $\\alpha$ hydrogens (ethyl benzoate and ethyl formate, for instance) and thus can function only as the acceptor partner. Intramolecular Claisen condensations, called Dieckmann cyclization reactions, yield five- and six-membered cyclic $\\beta$-keto esters starting from 1,6-and 1,7-diesters.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

With that accomplished, we have now begun to study the oxygen-containing functional groups that lie at the heart of organic and biological chemistry.\n\nAlcohols are among the most versatile of all organic compounds. They occur widely in nature, are important industrially, and have an unusually rich chemistry. The most widely used methods of alcohol synthesis start with carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids are reduced by reaction with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to give primary alcohols $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{OH}\\right)$; ketones are reduced to yield secondary alcohols ( $\\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{CHOH}$ ).\n\nAlcohols are also prepared by reaction of carbonyl compounds with Grignard reagents, RMgX. Addition of a Grignard reagent to formaldehyde yields a primary alcohol, addition to an aldehyde yields a secondary alcohol, and addition to a ketone or an ester yields a tertiary alcohol. The Grignard reaction is limited by the fact that Grignard reagents can't be prepared from alkyl halides that contain reactive functional groups in the same molecule. This problem can sometimes be avoided by protecting the interfering functional group. Alcohols are often protected by formation of trialkylsilyl ethers.\n\nAlcohols undergo many reactions and can be converted into many other functional groups. They can be dehydrated to give alkenes by treatment with $\\mathrm{POCl}_{3}$ and can be transformed into alkyl halides by treatment with $\\mathrm{PBr}_{3}$ or $\\mathrm{SOCl}_{2}$. Furthermore, alcohols are weakly acidic ( $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}} \\approx 16-18$ ) and react with strong bases and with alkali metals to form alkoxide anions, which are used frequently in organic synthesis. Perhaps the most important reaction of alcohols is their oxidation to carbonyl compounds. Primary alcohols yield either aldehydes or carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols yield ketones, but tertiary alcohols are not normally oxidized.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Put another way, optical activity can't appear from nowhere; an optically active product can only result by starting with an optically active reactant or chiral environment (Section 5.12).\n\nIn contrast to laboratory reactions, enzyme-catalyzed biological reactions often give a single enantiomer of a chiral product, even when the substrate is achiral. One step in the citric acid cycle of food metabolism, for instance, is the aconitase-catalyzed addition of water to (Z)-aconitate (usually called cis-aconitate) to give isocitrate.\n\n\nEven though cis-aconitate is achiral, only the ( $2 R, 3 S$ ) enantiomer of the product is formed. As discussed in Section 5.11 and Section 5.12, cis-aconitate is a prochiral molecule, which is held in a chiral environment by the aconitase enzyme during the reaction. In this environment, the two faces of the double bond are chemically distinct, and addition occurs on only the Re face at C2.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

For the alcohol (in this case, methanol), the carbon atom has an oxidation number of -2 (the oxygen atom is assigned -2 , the four hydrogen atoms each are assigned +1 , and the carbon atom balances the sum by having an oxidation number of -2 ; note that compared to the carbon atom in $\\mathrm{CH}_{4}$, this carbon atom has lost two electrons so it was oxidized); for the aldehyde, the carbon atom's oxidation number is 0 ( -2 for the oxygen atom and +1 for each hydrogen atom already balances to 0 , so the oxidation number for the carbon atom is 0 ); for the carboxylic acid, the carbon atom's oxidation number is +2 (two oxygen atoms each at -2 and two hydrogen atoms at +1 ); and for carbon dioxide, the carbon atom's oxidation number is +4 (here, the carbon atom needs to balance the -4 sum from the two oxygen atoms).",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

New reactions and new principles come from such situations, and it is in this way that the science of organic chemistry grows richer.

Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

We'll look both at acids and at their close relatives, nitriles ( $\\mathrm{RC} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ), in this chapter and at carboxylic acid derivatives in the next chapter.\n\nCarboxylic acids, $\\mathbf{R C O}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\mathbf{H}$, occupy a central place among carbonyl compounds. Not only are they valuable in themselves, they also serve as starting materials for preparing numerous carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides, esters, amides, and thioesters. In addition, carboxylic acids are present in the majority of biological pathways.\n\nAn acid chloride $\\quad$ An ester",

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition. Aldehydes and ketones have no such leaving group and thus do not usually undergo this reaction.\n\nThe Cannizzaro reaction takes place by nucleophilic addition of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to an aldehyde to give a tetrahedral intermediate, which expels hydride ion as a leaving group and is thereby oxidized. A second aldehyde molecule accepts the hydride ion in another nucleophilic addition step and is thereby reduced. Benzaldehyde, for instance, yields benzyl alcohol plus benzoic acid when heated with aqueous NaOH .",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

(b) A higher transition-state energy level (red curve) corresponds to a slower reaction (larger $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ ).",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Mixed aldol condensations between two different aldehydes or ketones generally give a mixture of all four possible products. A mixed reaction can be successful, however, if one of the two partners is an unusually good donor (ethyl acetoacetate, for instance) or if it can act only as an acceptor (formaldehyde and benzaldehyde, for instance). Intramolecular aldol condensations of 1,4- and 1,5-diketones are also successful and provide a good way to make five- and six-membered rings.\n\nThe Claisen condensation reaction is a carbonyl condensation that occurs between two ester components and gives a $\\beta$-keto ester product.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield. The extent to which a reaction's theoretical yield is achieved is commonly expressed as its percent yield:\n\n$$\n\\text { percent yield }=\\frac{\\text { actual yield }}{\\text { theoretical yield }} \\times 100 \\%\n$$\n\nActual and theoretical yields may be expressed as masses or molar amounts (or any other appropriate property; e.g., volume, if the product is a gas).

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

We'll look both at acids and at their close relatives, nitriles ( $\\mathrm{RC} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ), in this chapter and at carboxylic acid derivatives in the next chapter.\n\nCarboxylic acids, $\\mathbf{R C O}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\mathbf{H}$, occupy a central place among carbonyl compounds. Not only are they valuable in themselves, they also serve as starting materials for preparing numerous carboxylic acid derivatives such as acid chlorides, esters, amides, and thioesters. In addition, carboxylic acids are present in the majority of biological pathways.\n\nAn acid chloride $\\quad$ An ester",

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

In particular, it doesn't explain the stereochemistry of the addition reaction. That is, the mechanism doesn't account for which product stereoisomer is formed.\n\nWhen the halogenation reaction is carried out on a cycloalkene, such as cyclopentene, only the trans stereoisomer of the dihalide addition product is formed, rather than the mixture of cis and trans isomers that might have been expected if a planar carbocation intermediate were involved. We say that the reaction occurs with anti stereochemistry, meaning that the two bromine atoms come from opposite faces of the double bond-one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n\n\nAn explanation for the observed stereochemistry of addition was suggested in 1937 by George Kimball and Irving Roberts, who proposed that the reaction intermediate is not a carbocation but is instead a bromonium ion, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\mathbf{B r}^{+}$, formed by electrophilic addition of $\\mathrm{Br}^{+}$to the alkene. (Similarly, a chloronium ion contains a positively charged, divalent chlorine, $\\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{Cl}^{+}$.) The bromonium ion is formed in a single step by interaction of the alkene with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and the simultaneous loss of $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nHow does the formation of a bromonium ion account for the observed anti stereochemistry of addition to cyclopentene? If a bromonium ion is formed as an intermediate, we can imagine that the large bromine atom might \"shield\" one side of the molecule. Reaction with $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$ion in the second step could then occur only from the opposite, unshielded side to give the trans product.",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

New reactions and new principles come from such situations, and it is in this way that the science of organic chemistry grows richer.

From synthesizing vitamin $\\mathrm{B}_{12}$ to understanding pericyclic reactions-no one could have possibly predicted such a link at the beginning of the synthesis, but that is the way of science.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Nucleophilic substitution reactions are one of the most common and versatile reaction types in organic chemistry.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{X}+\\mathrm{Nu}:^{-} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{R}-\\mathrm{Nu}+\\mathrm{X}:^{-}\n$$\n\nFollowing the work of Walden, further investigations were undertaken during the 1920s and 1930s to clarify the mechanism of nucleophilic substitution reactions and to find out how inversions of configuration occur. Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

The reason for the difference is structural. As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

The reaction is favored when carried out with an unhindered substrate and a negatively charged nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, but is disfavored when carried out with a hindered substrate and a neutral nucleophile in a protic solvent. You might therefore expect the reaction of a tertiary substrate (hindered) with water (neutral, protic) to be among the slowest of substitution reactions. Remarkably, however, the opposite is true. The reaction of the tertiary halide 2-bromo-2-methylpropane $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{CBr}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to give the alcohol 2-methyl-2-propanol is more than 1 million times faster than the corresponding reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ to give methanol.\n\n\nWhat's going on here? A nucleophilic substitution reaction is occurring-a hydroxyl group is replacing a halogen-yet the reactivity order seems backward. These reactions can't be taking place by the $S_{N} 2$ mechanism we've been discussing, so we must therefore conclude that they are occurring by an alternative substitution\nmechanism.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Under acidic conditions, however, the reactivity of the carbonyl group is increased by protonation, so addition of an alcohol occurs rapidly.\n\n\nA neutral carbonyl group is moderately electrophilic because of the polarity of the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond.\n\n\nA protonated carbonyl group is strongly electrophilic because of the positive charge on carbon.\n\nAs shown in FIGURE 19.11, nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the carbonyl group initially yields a hydroxy ether called a hemiacetal, analogous to the gem diol formed by addition of water. Hemiacetals are formed reversibly, with equilibrium normally favoring the carbonyl compound. In the presence of acid, however, a further reaction occurs. Protonation of the - OH group, followed by an E1-like loss of water, leads to an oxonium ion, $\\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{C}=\\mathrm{O}^{+} \\mathrm{R}$, which undergoes a second nucleophilic addition of alcohol to yield the protonated acetal.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

With that accomplished, we have now begun to study the oxygen-containing functional groups that lie at the heart of organic and biological chemistry.\n\nAlcohols are among the most versatile of all organic compounds. They occur widely in nature, are important industrially, and have an unusually rich chemistry. The most widely used methods of alcohol synthesis start with carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids are reduced by reaction with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to give primary alcohols $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{OH}\\right)$; ketones are reduced to yield secondary alcohols ( $\\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{CHOH}$ ).\n\nAlcohols are also prepared by reaction of carbonyl compounds with Grignard reagents, RMgX. Addition of a Grignard reagent to formaldehyde yields a primary alcohol, addition to an aldehyde yields a secondary alcohol, and addition to a ketone or an ester yields a tertiary alcohol. The Grignard reaction is limited by the fact that Grignard reagents can't be prepared from alkyl halides that contain reactive functional groups in the same molecule. This problem can sometimes be avoided by protecting the interfering functional group. Alcohols are often protected by formation of trialkylsilyl ethers.\n\nAlcohols undergo many reactions and can be converted into many other functional groups. They can be dehydrated to give alkenes by treatment with $\\mathrm{POCl}_{3}$ and can be transformed into alkyl halides by treatment with $\\mathrm{PBr}_{3}$ or $\\mathrm{SOCl}_{2}$. Furthermore, alcohols are weakly acidic ( $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}} \\approx 16-18$ ) and react with strong bases and with alkali metals to form alkoxide anions, which are used frequently in organic synthesis. Perhaps the most important reaction of alcohols is their oxidation to carbonyl compounds. Primary alcohols yield either aldehydes or carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols yield ketones, but tertiary alcohols are not normally oxidized.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

With that accomplished, we have now begun to study the oxygen-containing functional groups that lie at the heart of organic and biological chemistry.\n\nAlcohols are among the most versatile of all organic compounds. They occur widely in nature, are important industrially, and have an unusually rich chemistry. The most widely used methods of alcohol synthesis start with carbonyl compounds. Aldehydes, esters, and carboxylic acids are reduced by reaction with $\\mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ to give primary alcohols $\\left(\\mathrm{RCH}_{2} \\mathrm{OH}\\right)$; ketones are reduced to yield secondary alcohols ( $\\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{CHOH}$ ).\n\nAlcohols are also prepared by reaction of carbonyl compounds with Grignard reagents, RMgX. Addition of a Grignard reagent to formaldehyde yields a primary alcohol, addition to an aldehyde yields a secondary alcohol, and addition to a ketone or an ester yields a tertiary alcohol. The Grignard reaction is limited by the fact that Grignard reagents can't be prepared from alkyl halides that contain reactive functional groups in the same molecule. This problem can sometimes be avoided by protecting the interfering functional group. Alcohols are often protected by formation of trialkylsilyl ethers.\n\nAlcohols undergo many reactions and can be converted into many other functional groups. They can be dehydrated to give alkenes by treatment with $\\mathrm{POCl}_{3}$ and can be transformed into alkyl halides by treatment with $\\mathrm{PBr}_{3}$ or $\\mathrm{SOCl}_{2}$. Furthermore, alcohols are weakly acidic ( $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}} \\approx 16-18$ ) and react with strong bases and with alkali metals to form alkoxide anions, which are used frequently in organic synthesis. Perhaps the most important reaction of alcohols is their oxidation to carbonyl compounds. Primary alcohols yield either aldehydes or carboxylic acids, secondary alcohols yield ketones, but tertiary alcohols are not normally oxidized.",

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6). We'll see examples of all these effects as we look at $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction variables.\n\n\nFIGURE 11.6 The effects of changes in reactant and transition-state energy levels on reaction rate.

Mixed aldol condensations between two different aldehydes or ketones generally give a mixture of all four possible products. A mixed reaction can be successful, however, if one of the two partners is an unusually good donor (ethyl acetoacetate, for instance) or if it can act only as an acceptor (formaldehyde and benzaldehyde, for instance).

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst. The catalyzed pathway involves a two-step mechanism (note the presence of two transition states) and an intermediate species (represented by the valley between the two transitions states).",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

As noted in Section 8.7, an organic oxidation results in a loss of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a more electronegative atom (usually $\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{N}$, or a halogen) or by bond-breaking between carbon and a less electronegative atom (usually H). Conversely, an organic reduction results in a gain of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a less electronegative atom or by bond-breaking between carbon and a more electronegative atom (Section 8.6).\n\nOxidation $\\quad$| Decreases electron density on carbon by: |  |  |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n|  | - forming one of these: $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O} \\quad \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{N}$ | $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ |\n|  | $\\quad$ or breaking this: $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ |  |\n\nBased on these definitions, the chlorination reaction of methane to yield chloromethane is an oxidation because a $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond is broken and a $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond is formed.

Mixed aldol condensations between two different aldehydes or ketones generally give a mixture of all four possible products.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile.

Thus, an understanding of their properties and reactions is fundamental to understanding biological chemistry. In this chapter, we've looked both at acids and at their close relatives, nitriles ( $\\mathrm{RC} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ).\n\nCarboxylic acids are named systematically by replacing the terminal -e of the corresponding alkane name with -oic acid. Like aldehydes and ketones, the carbonyl carbon atom is $s p^{2}$-hybridized; like alcohols, carboxylic acids are associated through hydrogen-bonding and therefore have high boiling points.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of carboxylic acids is their acidity. Although weaker than mineral acids such as HCl , carboxylic acids dissociate much more readily than alcohols because the resultant carboxylate ions are stabilized by resonance between two equivalent forms.\n\nMost carboxylic acids have $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ values near 5, but the exact $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ of a given acid depends on structure. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic (have a lower $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ) because their carboxylate ions are stabilized. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-donating groups are less acidic (have a higher $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ) because their carboxylate ions are destabilized. The extent of dissociation of a carboxylic acid in a buffered solution of a given pH can be calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular.

Finally, deprotonation by water gives the neutral addition product and regenerates the $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}^{+}$catalyst.\n\nNote the key difference between the base-catalyzed and acid-catalyzed reactions. The base-catalyzed reaction takes place rapidly because water is converted into hydroxide ion, a much better nucleophile. The acidcatalyzed reaction takes place rapidly because the carbonyl compound is converted by protonation into a much better electrophile.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

As with nucleophilic additions and nucleophilic acyl substitutions, many laboratory schemes, pharmaceutical syntheses, and biochemical pathways make frequent use of carbonyl $\\alpha$-substitution reactions. Their great value comes from the fact that they constitute one of the few general methods for forming carbon-carbon bonds, thereby making it possible to build larger molecules from smaller precursors. In this chapter, we'll see how and why these reactions occur.\n\nWe said in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry that much of the chemistry of carbonyl compounds can be explained by just four fundamental reaction types: nucleophilic additions, nucleophilic acyl substitutions, $\\alpha$ substitutions, and carbonyl condensations. Having studied the first two of these reactions in the past three chapters, let's now look in more detail at the third major carbonyl-group process-the $\\boldsymbol{a}$-substitution reaction.\n\nAlpha-substitution reactions occur at the position next to the carbonyl group-the $\\alpha$ position-and involve the substitution of an $\\alpha$ hydrogen atom by an electrophile, E, through either an enol or enolate ion intermediate. Let's begin by learning more about these two species.",

In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

This occurs through a transition state in which the new $\\mathrm{Nu}-\\mathrm{C}$ bond is partially formed at the same time that the old $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ bond is partially broken and in which the negative charge is shared by both the incoming nucleophile and the outgoing halide ion. The transition state for this inversion has the remaining three bonds to carbon in a planar arrangement (FIGURE 11.5).\n\n\nFIGURE 11.5 The transition state of an $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} 2$ reaction has a planar arrangement of the carbon atom and the remaining three groups. Electrostatic potential maps show that negative charge is delocalized in the transition state.\n\nThe mechanism proposed by Hughes and Ingold is fully consistent with experimental results, explaining both stereochemical and kinetic data. Thus, the requirement for a backside approach of the entering nucleophile ( $180^{\\circ}$ away from the departing X group) causes the stereochemistry of the substrate to invert, much like an umbrella turning inside-out in the wind. The Hughes-Ingold mechanism also explains why second-order kinetics are observed: the $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction occurs in a single step that involves both alkyl halide and nucleophile.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

Percent Yield - \nThe amount of product that may be produced by a reaction under specified conditions, as calculated per the stoichiometry of an appropriate balanced chemical equation, is called the theoretical yield of the reaction. In practice, the amount of product obtained is called the actual yield, and it is often less than the theoretical yield for a number of reasons. Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter). Some products are difficult to collect without some loss, and so less than perfect recovery will reduce the actual yield.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Among the first series studied was one that interconverted the two enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol (FIGURE 11.3). Although this particular series of reactions involves nucleophilic substitution of an alkyl para-toluenesulfonate (called a tosylate) rather than an alkyl halide, exactly the same type of reaction is involved as that studied by Walden. For all practical purposes, the entire tosylate group acts as if it were simply a halogen substituent. (In fact, when you see a tosylate substituent in a molecule, do a mental substitution and tell yourself that you're\ndealing with an alkyl halide.)\n\n\nFIGURE 11.3 A Walden cycle interconverting (+) and (-) enantiomers of 1-phenyl-2-propanol.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

As noted in Section 8.7, an organic oxidation results in a loss of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a more electronegative atom (usually $\\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{N}$, or a halogen) or by bond-breaking between carbon and a less electronegative atom (usually H). Conversely, an organic reduction results in a gain of electron density by carbon, caused either by bond formation between carbon and a less electronegative atom or by bond-breaking between carbon and a more electronegative atom (Section 8.6).\n\nOxidation $\\quad$| Decreases electron density on carbon by: |  |  |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n|  | - forming one of these: $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O} \\quad \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{N}$ | $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{X}$ |\n|  | $\\quad$ or breaking this: $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ |  |\n\nBased on these definitions, the chlorination reaction of methane to yield chloromethane is an oxidation because a $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bond is broken and a $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ bond is formed.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value.

A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level.

Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

When we measure this relationship, we measure the kinetics of the reaction. For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation. As either [ RX ] or [ ${ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}$ ] changes, the rate of the reaction changes proportionately.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text { Reaction rate } & =\\text { Rate of disappearance of reactant } \\\\\n& =k \\times[\\mathrm{RX}] \\times\\left[{ }^{-} \\mathrm{OH}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n$[\\mathrm{RX}]=\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ concentration in molarity\n$[-\\mathrm{OH}]=-\\mathrm{OH}$ concentration in molarity\n$k=$ a constant value (the rate constant)\nA mechanism that accounts for both the inversion of configuration and the second-order kinetics that are observed with nucleophilic substitution reactions was suggested in 1937 by the British chemists E. D. Hughes\nand Christopher Ingold, who formulated what they called the $\\mathbf{S}_{\\mathbf{N}} \\mathbf{2}$ reaction-short for substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular. (Bimolecular means that two molecules, nucleophile and alkyl halide, take part in the step whose kinetics are measured.)",

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Some $\\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{N}} 2$ reactions are fast, and some are slow; some take place in high yield and others in low yield. Understanding the factors involved can be of tremendous value. Let's begin by recalling a few things about reaction rates in general.\n\nThe rate of a chemical reaction is determined by the activation energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, the energy difference between reactant ground state and transition state. A change in reaction conditions can affect $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ either by changing the reactant energy level or by changing the transition-state energy level. Lowering the reactant energy or raising the transition-state energy increases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and decreases the reaction rate; raising the reactant energy or\ndecreasing the transition-state energy decreases $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and increases the reaction rate (FIGURE 11.6).

Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

As discussed previously in the Preview of Carbonyl Chemistry, and shown in FIGURE 19.12, the tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to a carboxylic acid derivative can eliminate a leaving group, leading to a net nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group. One exception to this rule is the Cannizzaro reaction, discovered in 1853.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\text { Reaction occurs when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{2} \\\\\n\\text { Reaction does NOT occur when: } & \\mathrm{Y}=-\\mathrm{H},-\\mathrm{R}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFIGURE 19.12 Carboxylic acid derivatives have an electronegative substituent $\\mathbf{Y}=-\\mathrm{Br},-\\mathrm{Cl},-\\mathrm{OR},-\\mathrm{NR}_{\\mathbf{2}}$ that can be expelled as a leaving group from the tetrahedral intermediate formed by nucleophilic addition. Aldehydes and ketones have no such leaving group and thus do not usually undergo this reaction.\n\nThe Cannizzaro reaction takes place by nucleophilic addition of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to an aldehyde to give a tetrahedral intermediate, which expels hydride ion as a leaving group and is thereby oxidized. A second aldehyde molecule accepts the hydride ion in another nucleophilic addition step and is thereby reduced. Benzaldehyde, for instance, yields benzyl alcohol plus benzoic acid when heated with aqueous NaOH .",

In this chapter, we've looked both at acids and at their close relatives, nitriles ( $\\mathrm{RC} \\equiv \\mathrm{N}$ ).\n\nCarboxylic acids are named systematically by replacing the terminal -e of the corresponding alkane name with -oic acid. Like aldehydes and ketones, the carbonyl carbon atom is $s p^{2}$-hybridized; like alcohols, carboxylic acids are associated through hydrogen-bonding and therefore have high boiling points.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic of carboxylic acids is their acidity. Although weaker than mineral acids such as HCl , carboxylic acids dissociate much more readily than alcohols because the resultant carboxylate ions are stabilized by resonance between two equivalent forms.\n\nMost carboxylic acids have $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ values near 5, but the exact $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ of a given acid depends on structure. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-withdrawing groups are more acidic (have a lower $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ) because their carboxylate ions are stabilized. Carboxylic acids substituted by electron-donating groups are less acidic (have a higher $\\mathrm{p} K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ) because their carboxylate ions are destabilized.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reaction is favored when carried out with an unhindered substrate and a negatively charged nucleophile in a polar aprotic solvent, but is disfavored when carried out with a hindered substrate and a neutral nucleophile in a protic solvent. You might therefore expect the reaction of a tertiary substrate (hindered) with water (neutral, protic) to be among the slowest of substitution reactions. Remarkably, however, the opposite is true. The reaction of the tertiary halide 2-bromo-2-methylpropane $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3}\\right)_{3} \\mathrm{CBr}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ to give the alcohol 2-methyl-2-propanol is more than 1 million times faster than the corresponding reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ to give methanol.\n\n\nWhat's going on here? A nucleophilic substitution reaction is occurring-a hydroxyl group is replacing a halogen-yet the reactivity order seems backward.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Some reactions are inherently inefficient, being accompanied by side reactions that generate other products. Others are, by nature, incomplete (consider the partial reactions of weak acids and bases discussed earlier in this chapter).

The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

For example, let's look at the kinetics of a simple nucleophilic substitution-the reaction of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$ with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to yield $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ plus $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nWith a given temperature, solvent, and concentration of reactants, the substitution occurs at a certain rate. If we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the frequency of encounters between reaction partners doubles and we find that the reaction rate also doubles. Similarly, if we double the concentration of $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{Br}$, the reaction rate again doubles. We call such a reaction, in which the rate is linearly dependent on the concentrations of two species, a second-order reaction. Mathematically, we can express this second-order dependence of the nucleophilic substitution reaction by setting up a rate equation.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds.

Aldehydes and Ketones - \nFIGURE 21.14 The carbonyl group is polar, and the geometry of the bonds around the central carbon is trigonal planar.\n\nThe importance of molecular structure in the reactivity of organic compounds is illustrated by the reactions that produce aldehydes and ketones. We can prepare a carbonyl group by oxidation of an alcohol-for organic molecules, oxidation of a carbon atom is said to occur when a carbon-hydrogen bond is replaced by a carbonoxygen bond. The reverse reaction-replacing a carbon-oxygen bond by a carbon-hydrogen bond-is a reduction of that carbon atom. Recall that oxygen is generally assigned a -2 oxidation number unless it is elemental or attached to a fluorine. Hydrogen is generally assigned an oxidation number of +1 unless it is attached to a metal. Since carbon does not have a specific rule, its oxidation number is determined algebraically by factoring the atoms it is attached to and the overall charge of the molecule or ion. In general, a carbon atom attached to an oxygen atom will have a more positive oxidation number and a carbon atom attached to a hydrogen atom will have a more negative oxidation number. This should fit nicely with your understanding of the polarity of $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds. The other reagents and possible products of these reactions are beyond the scope of this chapter, so we will focus only on the changes to the carbon atoms:\n\n\nEXAMPLE 21.10",

Inspection of the diagrams reveals several traits of these reactions. Consistent with the fact that the two diagrams represent the same overall reaction, both curves begin and end at the same energies (in this case, because products are more energetic than reactants, the reaction is endothermic). The reaction mechanisms, however, are clearly different. The uncatalyzed reaction proceeds via a one-step mechanism (one transition state observed), whereas the catalyzed reaction follows a two-step mechanism (two transition states observed) with a notably lesser activation energy. This difference illustrates the means by which a catalyst functions to accelerate reactions, namely, by providing an alternative reaction mechanism with a lower activation energy. Although the catalyzed reaction mechanism for a reaction needn't necessarily involve a different number of steps than the uncatalyzed mechanism, it must provide a reaction path whose rate determining step is faster (lower $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ ).\n\n\nFIGURE 17.21 Reaction diagrams for an endothermic process in the absence (red curve) and presence (blue curve) of a catalyst.

The reason for the difference is structural.

The tetrahedral intermediate produced by addition of a nucleophile to an aldehyde or ketone, however, has only alkyl or hydrogen substituents and thus can't usually expel a leaving group.

In particular, it doesn't explain the stereochemistry of the addition reaction. That is, the mechanism doesn't account for which product stereoisomer is formed.\n\nWhen the halogenation reaction is carried out on a cycloalkene, such as cyclopentene, only the trans stereoisomer of the dihalide addition product is formed, rather than the mixture of cis and trans isomers that might have been expected if a planar carbocation intermediate were involved. We say that the reaction occurs with anti stereochemistry, meaning that the two bromine atoms come from opposite faces of the double bond-one from the top face and one from the bottom face.\n\n\nAn explanation for the observed stereochemistry of addition was suggested in 1937 by George Kimball and Irving Roberts, who proposed that the reaction intermediate is not a carbocation but is instead a bromonium ion, $\\mathbf{R}_{\\mathbf{2}} \\mathbf{B r}^{+}$, formed by electrophilic addition of $\\mathrm{Br}^{+}$to the alkene. (Similarly, a chloronium ion contains a positively charged, divalent chlorine, $\\mathrm{R}_{2} \\mathrm{Cl}^{+}$.) The bromonium ion is formed in a single step by interaction of the alkene with $\\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ and the simultaneous loss of $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$.\n\n\nHow does the formation of a bromonium ion account for the observed anti stereochemistry of addition to cyclopentene? If a bromonium ion is formed as an intermediate, we can imagine that the large bromine atom might \"shield\" one side of the molecule. Reaction with $\\mathrm{Br}^{-}$ion in the second step could then occur only from the opposite, unshielded side to give the trans product.",
