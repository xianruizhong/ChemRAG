The (NHC)borane adduct was prepared then reduced with Co(Cp*)2. One equivalent of reductant yielded an aminoboryl radical and a second reduction event lead to the desired (CAAC)borylene. Another group followed a similar synthetic strategy using DAC(diamidocarbene); the reduction of a (DAC)borane derivative afforded an analogous (DAC)borylene (see figure).

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Although monoalkyne complexes CpCo(CO)(R1C2R2) have not been isolated, their analogues, CpCo(PPh3)(R1C2R2) are made by the following reactions: CpCo(CO)2 + PR3 → CO + CpCo(CO)(PR3) CpCoL(PR3) + R2C2 → L + CpCo(PR3)(R2C2) (where L = CO or PR3) CpCo(CO)2 catalyzes the formation of pyridines from a mixture of alkynes and nitriles. Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2].

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC.

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law .

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

Stereochemistry SMILES permits, but does not require, specification of stereoisomers. Configuration around double bonds is specified using the characters / and \\ to show directional single bonds adjacent to a double bond.

For example, aqueous sodium chloride may be written as [Na+].[Cl-] to show the dissociation. An aromatic \"one and a half\" bond may be indicated with :; see below. Single bonds adjacent to double bonds may be represented using / or \\ to indicate stereochemical configuration; see below.",

In the latter case, bonds between two aromatic atoms are assumed (if not explicitly shown) to be aromatic bonds. Thus, benzene, pyridine and furan can be represented respectively by the SMILES c1ccccc1, n1ccccc1 and o1cccc1.

Example for two reactants Consider the combustion of benzene, represented by the following chemical equation: 2 C6H6(l) + 15 O2(g) -> 12 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l) This means that 15 moles of molecular oxygen (O2) is required to react with 2 moles of benzene (C6H6) The amount of oxygen required for other quantities of benzene can be calculated using cross-multiplication (the rule of three).

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

Most chemical reactions are stepwise, that is they take more than one elementary step to complete. An intermediate is the reaction product of each of these steps, except for the last one, which forms the final product. Reactive intermediates are usually short lived and are very seldom isolated. Also, owing to the short lifetime, they do not remain in the product mixture. For example, consider this hypothetical stepwise reaction: A + B → C + D The reaction includes these elementary steps: A + B → X* X* → C + D The chemical species X* is an intermediate.",

Although monoalkyne complexes CpCo(CO)(R1C2R2) have not been isolated, their analogues, CpCo(PPh3)(R1C2R2) are made by the following reactions: CpCo(CO)2 + PR3 → CO + CpCo(CO)(PR3) CpCoL(PR3) + R2C2 → L + CpCo(PR3)(R2C2) (where L = CO or PR3) CpCo(CO)2 catalyzes the formation of pyridines from a mixture of alkynes and nitriles. Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2]. Ketones are produced by carbonylation of these dialkyl complexes, regenerating CpCo(CO)2.",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2.

The net reaction is: The rate law for this process is k[CH4][Cl2]. This can be shown using the steady-state approximation.",

Thus, benzoyl peroxide readily undergoes homolysis (symmetrical fission), forming free radicals: (C6H5CO)2O2 → 2 The symbol • indicates that the products are radicals; i.e., they contain at least one unpaired electron. Such species are highly reactive. The homolysis is usually induced by heating. The half-life of benzoyl peroxide is one hour at 92 °C. At 131 °C, the half-life is one minute.

At physiological conditions, ketopantoic acid exists as its conjugate base, ketopantoate (HOCH2(CH3)2CC(O)CO2−). Biosynthetic context Its biosynthesis proceeds from ketoisovalerate by hydroxymethylation: (CH3)2CHC(O)CO2− + CH2O → HOCH2(CH3)2CC(O)CO2− This conversion is catalyzed by ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, which gives ketopantoate. Ketopantoate is substrate for 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, which produces pantoate, a precursor to pantothenic acid, a common prosthetic group. References",

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2.

Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

The layout should eventually look like this, for a balanced reaction of baking soda and vinegar (HC2H3O2 + NaHCO3 = NaC2H3O2 + H2CO3) From this, since the number of reactants for each element equals the number of products for each element, we can tell that each side is balanced in the equation.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

For example, F/C=C/F (see depiction) is one representation of trans-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorine atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond (as shown in the figure), whereas F/C=C\\F (see depiction) is one possible representation of cis-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorines are on the same side of the double bond.",

Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2].

This may be solved to find the steady-state concentration of •CH3 radicals as [•CH3] = (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]1/2. It follows that the rate of formation of CH4 is d[CH4]/dt = k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] = k2 (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]3/2 Thus the mechanism explains the observed rate expression, for the principal products CH4 and CO.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

One reactant (A) is chosen, and the balanced chemical equation is used to determine the amount of the other reactant (B) necessary to react with A. If the amount of B actually present exceeds the amount required, then B is in excess and A is the limiting reagent. If the amount of B present is less than required, then B is the limiting reagent. Example for two reactants Consider the combustion of benzene, represented by the following chemical equation: 2 C6H6(l) + 15 O2(g) -> 12 CO2(g) + 6 H2O(l) This means that 15 moles of molecular oxygen (O2) is required to react with 2 moles of benzene (C6H6) The amount of oxygen required for other quantities of benzene can be calculated using cross-multiplication (the rule of three).

It follows that the rate of formation of CH4 is d[CH4]/dt = k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] = k2 (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]3/2 Thus the mechanism explains the observed rate expression, for the principal products CH4 and CO. The exact rate law may be even more complicated, there are also minor products such as acetone (CH3COCH3) and propanal (CH3CH2CHO).

Most chemical reactions are stepwise, that is they take more than one elementary step to complete. An intermediate is the reaction product of each of these steps, except for the last one, which forms the final product. Reactive intermediates are usually short lived and are very seldom isolated. Also, owing to the short lifetime, they do not remain in the product mixture. For example, consider this hypothetical stepwise reaction: A + B → C + D The reaction includes these elementary steps: A + B → X* X* → C + D The chemical species X* is an intermediate.",

The catalytic cycle begins with dissociation of one CO ligand forming bis(alkyne) intermediate.

Although monoalkyne complexes CpCo(CO)(R1C2R2) have not been isolated, their analogues, CpCo(PPh3)(R1C2R2) are made by the following reactions: CpCo(CO)2 + PR3 → CO + CpCo(CO)(PR3) CpCoL(PR3) + R2C2 → L + CpCo(PR3)(R2C2) (where L = CO or PR3) CpCo(CO)2 catalyzes the formation of pyridines from a mixture of alkynes and nitriles. Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2].

However, an isolable example remained elusive until 2014. Betrand et al. argued that due to boron's electropositivity and thus preference to be electron-poor, CAAC (cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene) might serve as a better Lewis base than the more commonplace NHC. The (NHC)borane adduct was prepared then reduced with Co(Cp*)2. One equivalent of reductant yielded an aminoboryl radical and a second reduction event lead to the desired (CAAC)borylene. Another group followed a similar synthetic strategy using DAC(diamidocarbene); the reduction of a (DAC)borane derivative afforded an analogous (DAC)borylene (see figure). Although the C=B=NR2 structure is similar in nature to aminoboraalkenes, an exploration of molecular orbitals gives an entirely different picture: as expected, the HOMO is a bond of π symmetry derived from",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

The ozone decomposition consists of two elementary steps: The first one corresponds to a unimolecular reaction because one only molecule of ozone decomposes into two products (molecular oxygen and oxygen). Then, the oxygen from the first step is an intermediate because it participates as a reactant in the second step, which is a bimolecular reaction because there are two different reactants (ozone and oxygen) that give rise to one product, that corresponds to molecular oxygen in the gas phase.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene.
