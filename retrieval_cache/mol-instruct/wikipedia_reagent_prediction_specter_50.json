Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Although the catalyst takes part in the reaction, it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is",

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

Cannizzaro first accomplished this transformation in 1853, when he obtained benzyl alcohol and potassium benzoate from the treatment of benzaldehyde with potash (potassium carbonate). More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

This type of reaction is also referred to as a nitroaldol reaction (nitroalkane, aldehyde, and alcohol). It is nearly analogous to the aldol reaction that had been discovered 23 years prior that couples two carbonyl compounds to form β-hydroxy carbonyl compounds known as \"aldols\" (aldehyde and alcohol). The Henry reaction is a useful technique in the area of organic chemistry due to the synthetic utility of its corresponding products, as they can be easily converted to other useful synthetic intermediates. These conversions include subsequent dehydration to yield nitroalkenes, oxidation of the secondary alcohol to yield α-nitro ketones, or reduction of the nitro group to yield β-amino alcohols.",

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

It is an equilibrium reaction, but the reaction can be driven to completion by exploiting the differential solubility of halide salts, or by using a large excess of the halide salt. R–X + X′− R–X′ + X− Method The classic Finkelstein reaction entails the conversion of an alkyl chloride or an alkyl bromide to an alkyl iodide by treatment with a solution of sodium iodide in acetone. Sodium iodide is soluble in acetone while sodium chloride and sodium bromide are not. The reaction is driven toward products by mass action due to the precipitation of the poorly soluble NaCl or NaBr. An example involves the conversion of the ethyl ester of 5-bromovaleric acid to the iodide: EtO2C(CH2)4Br + NaI → EtO2C(CH2)4I + NaBr",

In the process, the catalyst is regenerated. In principle, often only small amounts of catalysts are required to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes slow or are even consumed in secondary processes. The catalyst does often appear in the rate equation. As a simple example in the gas phase, the reaction 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3 can be catalyzed by adding nitric oxide. The reaction mechanism occurs in two steps: 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2 (slow) NO2 + SO2 → NO + SO3 (fast, twice) The overall reaction is the first equation plus twice the second reaction, so that the NO catalyst is regenerated and does not participate in the net reaction. The overall rate is the rate of the slow step v = 2k1[NO]2[O2].",

Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction.

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The crushing disappointment at having lost out on his chance of scientific recognition led him first to withdraw from Science and then to suffer a nervous breakdown. He spent years in and out of an asylum. However, now that scientists were beginning to understand the way carbon combines with itself and other elements, it was possible to create new compounds by design and industrial chemistry was born.

Two German chemists also preceded Schlotterbeck in discovery of the reaction, Hans von Pechmann in 1895 and Viktor Meyer in 1905. The reaction has since been extended to the synthesis of β-keto esters from the condensation between aldehydes and diazo esters. The general reaction scheme is as follows: The reaction yields two possible carbonyl compounds (I and II) along with an epoxide (III).

This type of reaction is also referred to as a nitroaldol reaction (nitroalkane, aldehyde, and alcohol). It is nearly analogous to the aldol reaction that had been discovered 23 years prior that couples two carbonyl compounds to form β-hydroxy carbonyl compounds known as \"aldols\" (aldehyde and alcohol). The Henry reaction is a useful technique in the area of organic chemistry due to the synthetic utility of its corresponding products, as they can be easily converted to other useful synthetic intermediates. These conversions include subsequent dehydration to yield nitroalkenes, oxidation of the secondary alcohol to yield α-nitro ketones, or reduction of the nitro group to yield β-amino alcohols.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

In the strictest definition of the term, the reaction conditions do not change among the consecutive steps of a cascade and no new reagents are added after the initial step. By contrast, one-pot procedures similarly allow at least two reactions to be carried out consecutively without any isolation of intermediates, but do not preclude the addition of new reagents or the change of conditions after the first reaction.

Reactions between aldimines and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. The reaction is named after chemist Carl Mannich. The Mannich reaction is an example of nucleophilic addition of an amine to a carbonyl group followed by dehydration to the Schiff base. The Schiff base is an electrophile which reacts in the second step in an electrophilic addition with a compound containing an acidic proton (which is, or had become an enol). The Mannich reaction is also considered a condensation reaction.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

When R = OCH2CH3, the rate of the reaction is the fastest because the reaction has the smallest energy of activation (ΔG‡). The ethoxy and cyano groups are able to delocalize the radical ion in the transition state, thus stabilizing the radical center. The rate enhancement is due to the captodative effect. When R = H, the reaction has the largest energy of activation because the radical center is not stabilized by the captodative effect. The hydrogen atom is not able to delocalize the radical ion. Thus, the reaction is slow relative to the R = OCH2CH3 case. When R = CH3, the rate of the reaction is faster relative to when R = H because methyl groups have more electron donating capability. However, the reaction rate is slower relative to when R = OCH2CH3 because the radical ion is not delocalized over the methyl group . Thus, the captodative does not influence the reaction",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Theoretically, the reaction resembles the ideal Turing pattern, a system that emerges qualitatively from solving the reaction diffusion equations for a reaction that generates both a reaction inhibitor and a reaction promoter, of which the two diffuse across the medium at different rates. One of the most common variations on this reaction uses malonic acid (CH2(CO2H)2) as the acid and potassium bromate (KBrO3) as the source of bromine.

The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Among the tens of thousands of organic reactions that are known, hundreds of such reactions are well-known enough to be named after people. Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

Cannizzaro first accomplished this transformation in 1853, when he obtained benzyl alcohol and potassium benzoate from the treatment of benzaldehyde with potash (potassium carbonate). More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Reactions between aldimines and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. The reaction is named after chemist Carl Mannich. The Mannich reaction is an example of nucleophilic addition of an amine to a carbonyl group followed by dehydration to the Schiff base. The Schiff base is an electrophile which reacts in the second step in an electrophilic addition with a compound containing an acidic proton (which is, or had become an enol).

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

One hundred years later, the Bargellini reaction itself was used for the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and his own named reaction produced it.

One example, thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde is prepared by the reaction of hexamine with 2-chloromethylthiophene. The reaction is formally an oxidation of the carbon. Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that. One hundred years later, the Bargellini reaction itself was used for the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and his own named reaction produced it.

More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Also, owing to the short lifetime, they do not remain in the product mixture. For example, consider this hypothetical stepwise reaction: A + B → C + D The reaction includes these elementary steps: A + B → X* X* → C + D The chemical species X* is an intermediate.",

In 1820 Faraday reported the first synthesis of compounds made from carbon and chlorine, C2Cl6 and C2Cl4, and published his results the following year. Faraday also determined the composition of the chlorine clathrate hydrate, which had been discovered by Humphry Davy in 1810.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

In cascade reactions, isolation of intermediates is not required, as each reaction composing the sequence occurs spontaneously. In the strictest definition of the term, the reaction conditions do not change among the consecutive steps of a cascade and no new reagents are added after the initial step. By contrast, one-pot procedures similarly allow at least two reactions to be carried out consecutively without any isolation of intermediates, but do not preclude the addition of new reagents or the change of conditions after the first reaction. Thus, any cascade reaction is also a one-pot procedure, while the reverse does not hold true. Although often composed solely of intramolecular transformations, cascade reactions can also occur",

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that.

When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

The rule was formulated by Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov in 1870. Explanation The rule states that with the addition of a protic acid HX or other polar reagent to an asymmetric alkene, the acid hydrogen (H) or electropositive part gets attached to the carbon with more hydrogen substituents, and the halide (X) group or electronegative part gets attached to the carbon with more alkyl substituents. This is in contrast to Markovnikov's original definition, in which the rule is stated that the X component is added to the carbon with the fewest hydrogen atoms while the hydrogen atom is added to the carbon with the greatest number of hydrogen atoms.",

Reactions between aldimines and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. The reaction is named after chemist Carl Mannich. The Mannich reaction is an example of nucleophilic addition of an amine to a carbonyl group followed by dehydration to the Schiff base. The Schiff base is an electrophile which reacts in the second step in an electrophilic addition with a compound containing an acidic proton (which is, or had become an enol). The Mannich reaction is also considered a condensation reaction.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction.

The first chemical reaction in organic chemistry that utilized a catalyst was studied in 1811 by Gottlieb Kirchhoff who discovered the acid-catalyzed conversion of starch to glucose. The term catalysis was later used by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1835 to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Fulhame, who predated Berzelius, did work with water as opposed to metals in her reduction experiments. Other 18th century chemists who worked in catalysis were Eilhard Mitscherlich who referred to it as contact processes, and Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who spoke of contact action.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically feasible, and has experimental support in isolated intermediates (see next section) or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. It also describes each reactive intermediate, activated complex, and transition state, and which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the reactants and catalyst used, the stereochemistry observed in reactants and products, all products formed and the amount of each.",

However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

They mentioned that reaction of saturated primary alcohols with PDC, using dimethylformamide as solvent, results in oxidation to carboxylic acids rather than aldehydes.

One example, thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde is prepared by the reaction of hexamine with 2-chloromethylthiophene. The reaction is formally an oxidation of the carbon. Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Among the tens of thousands of organic reactions that are known, hundreds of such reactions are well-known enough to be named after people. Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

A very old named reaction is the Claisen rearrangement (1912) and a recent named reaction is the Bingel reaction (1993). When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

Although the catalyst takes part in the reaction, it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogeneous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors. Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is",

Sometimes the product will differ significantly enough from the reactant that it is easily purified following the reaction such as when a product is insoluble and precipitates out of solution while the reactants remained dissolved. History Ever since the mid nineteenth century chemists have been increasingly preoccupied with synthesizing chemical products. Disciplines focused on isolation and characterization of products, such as natural products chemists, remain important to the field, and the combination of their contributions alongside synthetic chemists has resulted in much of the framework through which chemistry is understood today.",

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

The reaction mechanism occurs in two steps: 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2 (slow) NO2 + SO2 → NO + SO3 (fast, twice) The overall reaction is the first equation plus twice the second reaction, so that the NO catalyst is regenerated and does not participate in the net reaction.

Initial findings by Pauson and Khand were intermolecular in nature, however many intramolecular examples have been highlighted in both synthesis and methodology reports, starting a decade later from reaction discovery. This reaction was originally mediated by stoichiometric amounts of dicobalt octacarbonyl, but newer versions are both more efficient and catalytic utilizing different chiral auxiliaries for stereo induction, main group transition-metals (Ti, Mo, W, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Ir and Pd), and additives to enhance",

When R = OCH2CH3, the rate of the reaction is the fastest because the reaction has the smallest energy of activation (ΔG‡). The ethoxy and cyano groups are able to delocalize the radical ion in the transition state, thus stabilizing the radical center. The rate enhancement is due to the captodative effect. When R = H, the reaction has the largest energy of activation because the radical center is not stabilized by the captodative effect. The hydrogen atom is not able to delocalize the radical ion. Thus, the reaction is slow relative to the R = OCH2CH3 case. When R = CH3, the rate of the reaction is faster relative to when R = H because methyl groups have more electron donating capability. However, the reaction rate is slower relative to when R = OCH2CH3 because the radical ion is not delocalized over the methyl group . Thus, the captodative does not influence the reaction",

A longstanding goal in organic synthesis, C–H activation would allow for inert, unreactive C–H bonds to be replaced with bonds to functional groups that can alter a molecule's reactivity and properties. One strategy to achieve selective C–H activation under mild conditions is to use metal-based catalysts that are guided to the targeted C–H bond by nearby directing functional groups. These directing groups often must be removed once the new functional group has been appended to the molecule. This style of C–H activation methodology could greatly simplify the synthesis of pharmaceutical drug molecules, agrochemicals, and natural products.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

In the process, the catalyst is regenerated. In principle, often only small amounts of catalysts are required to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes slow or are even consumed in secondary processes. The catalyst does often appear in the rate equation. As a simple example in the gas phase, the reaction 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3 can be catalyzed by adding nitric oxide. The reaction mechanism occurs in two steps: 2 NO + O2 → 2 NO2 (slow) NO2 + SO2 → NO + SO3 (fast, twice) The overall reaction is the first equation plus twice the second reaction, so that the NO catalyst is regenerated and does not participate in the net reaction. The overall rate is the rate of the slow step v = 2k1[NO]2[O2].",

No decade has gone by without an important addition or twist of the reaction taking place. In the author's own words, \"The first phase in the reaction is probably the formation of acetonechloroform--(which may, indeed, be used in place of the chloroform), this being then acted on by sodium hydroxide in presence of acetone, yielding α-hydroxyisobutyric acid, which, with the phenol, gives α-phenoxyisobutyric acid. The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that. One hundred years later, the Bargellini reaction itself was used for the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and his own named reaction produced it.

Well-known examples include the Grignard reaction, the Sabatier reaction, the Wittig reaction, the Claisen condensation, the Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the Diels-Alder reaction. Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic. Some cases of reactions that were not really discovered by their namesakes are known. Examples include the Pummerer rearrangement, the Pinnick oxidation and the Birch reduction.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate which obeys the rate law . Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps.

The first chemical reaction in organic chemistry that utilized a catalyst was studied in 1811 by Gottlieb Kirchhoff who discovered the acid-catalyzed conversion of starch to glucose. The term catalysis was later used by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1835 to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Fulhame, who predated Berzelius, did work with water as opposed to metals in her reduction experiments.

A reaction step involving one molecular entity is called unimolecular. A reaction step involving two molecular entities is called bimolecular. A reaction step involving three molecular entities is called trimolecular or termolecular. In general, reaction steps involving more than three molecular entities do not occur, because is statistically improbable in terms of Maxwell distribution to find such transition state.

In cascade reactions, isolation of intermediates is not required, as each reaction composing the sequence occurs spontaneously. In the strictest definition of the term, the reaction conditions do not change among the consecutive steps of a cascade and no new reagents are added after the initial step. By contrast, one-pot procedures similarly allow at least two reactions to be carried out consecutively without any isolation of intermediates, but do not preclude the addition of new reagents or the change of conditions after the first reaction. Thus, any cascade reaction is also a one-pot procedure, while the reverse does not hold true. Although often composed solely of intramolecular transformations, cascade reactions can also occur",

When R = OCH2CH3, the rate of the reaction is the fastest because the reaction has the smallest energy of activation (ΔG‡). The ethoxy and cyano groups are able to delocalize the radical ion in the transition state, thus stabilizing the radical center. The rate enhancement is due to the captodative effect. When R = H, the reaction has the largest energy of activation because the radical center is not stabilized by the captodative effect. The hydrogen atom is not able to delocalize the radical ion. Thus, the reaction is slow relative to the R = OCH2CH3 case. When R = CH3, the rate of the reaction is faster relative to when R = H because methyl groups have more electron donating capability.

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The final product is a β-amino-carbonyl compound also known as a Mannich base. Reactions between aldimines and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. The reaction is named after chemist Carl Mannich. The Mannich reaction is an example of nucleophilic addition of an amine to a carbonyl group followed by dehydration to the Schiff base. The Schiff base is an electrophile which reacts in the second step in an electrophilic addition with a compound containing an acidic proton (which is, or had become an enol). The Mannich reaction is also considered a condensation reaction.",

The chloroform may also be replaced by bromoform, bromal, chloral, or carbon tetrachloride or tetrabromide.\" Most textbooks describe the reaction as a way to make morpholinones or piperazinones, but it use extend much farther than that. One hundred years later, the Bargellini reaction itself was used for the condensation of coumarins, an ironic twist to the history of the reaction since this was Bargellini's primary compound of interest and his own named reaction produced it.

A longstanding goal in organic synthesis, C–H activation would allow for inert, unreactive C–H bonds to be replaced with bonds to functional groups that can alter a molecule's reactivity and properties. One strategy to achieve selective C–H activation under mild conditions is to use metal-based catalysts that are guided to the targeted C–H bond by nearby directing functional groups. These directing groups often must be removed once the new functional group has been appended to the molecule. This style of C–H activation methodology could greatly simplify the synthesis of pharmaceutical drug molecules, agrochemicals, and natural products.",

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction).

A chemical mechanism is a theoretical conjecture that tries to describe in detail what takes place at each stage of an overall chemical reaction. The detailed steps of a reaction are not observable in most cases. The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically feasible, and has experimental support in isolated intermediates (see next section) or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. It also describes each reactive intermediate, activated complex, and transition state, and which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the reactants and catalyst used, the stereochemistry observed in reactants and products, all products formed and the amount of each.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

This type of reaction is also referred to as a nitroaldol reaction (nitroalkane, aldehyde, and alcohol). It is nearly analogous to the aldol reaction that had been discovered 23 years prior that couples two carbonyl compounds to form β-hydroxy carbonyl compounds known as \"aldols\" (aldehyde and alcohol). The Henry reaction is a useful technique in the area of organic chemistry due to the synthetic utility of its corresponding products, as they can be easily converted to other useful synthetic intermediates. These conversions include subsequent dehydration to yield nitroalkenes, oxidation of the secondary alcohol to yield α-nitro ketones, or reduction of the nitro group to yield β-amino alcohols.",

In the strictest definition of the term, the reaction conditions do not change among the consecutive steps of a cascade and no new reagents are added after the initial step. By contrast, one-pot procedures similarly allow at least two reactions to be carried out consecutively without any isolation of intermediates, but do not preclude the addition of new reagents or the change of conditions after the first reaction.

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Disciplines focused on isolation and characterization of products, such as natural products chemists, remain important to the field, and the combination of their contributions alongside synthetic chemists has resulted in much of the framework through which chemistry is understood today.",

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure.

When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

The original reaction was a mixture of the reagents phenol, chloroform, and acetone in the presence of a sodium hydroxide solution. Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

Books have been published devoted exclusively to name reactions; the Merck Index, a chemical encyclopedia, also includes an appendix on name reactions. As organic chemistry developed during the 20th century, chemists started associating synthetically useful reactions with the names of the discoverers or developers; in many cases, the name is merely a mnemonic.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

Cannizzaro first accomplished this transformation in 1853, when he obtained benzyl alcohol and potassium benzoate from the treatment of benzaldehyde with potash (potassium carbonate). More typically, the reaction would be conducted with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, giving the sodium or potassium carboxylate salt of the carboxylic-acid product: 2 C6H5CHO + KOH → C6H5CH2OH + C6H5COOK The process is a redox reaction involving transfer of a hydride from one substrate molecule to the other: one aldehyde is oxidized to form the acid, the other is reduced to form the alcohol.",

A very old named reaction is the Claisen rearrangement (1912) and a recent named reaction is the Bingel reaction (1993). When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

Prior to Bargellini's research, the product attributed to this multi-component reaction (MCR) had been described as a phenol derivative in chemistry texts at the time. However, Bargellini demonstrated that a carboxylic acid derivative was actually the correct structure. Later, organic chemists have used the reaction as a general method of organic synthesis for highly hindered or bulky morpholinones or piperazinones from ketones (particularly acetone) and either β-amino alcohols or diamines.

The crushing disappointment at having lost out on his chance of scientific recognition led him first to withdraw from Science and then to suffer a nervous breakdown. He spent years in and out of an asylum. However, now that scientists were beginning to understand the way carbon combines with itself and other elements, it was possible to create new compounds by design and industrial chemistry was born.

The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation.

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

R–X + X′− R–X′ + X− Method The classic Finkelstein reaction entails the conversion of an alkyl chloride or an alkyl bromide to an alkyl iodide by treatment with a solution of sodium iodide in acetone. Sodium iodide is soluble in acetone while sodium chloride and sodium bromide are not. The reaction is driven toward products by mass action due to the precipitation of the poorly soluble NaCl or NaBr.

An intermediate is the reaction product of each of these steps, except for the last one, which forms the final product. Reactive intermediates are usually short lived and are very seldom isolated. Also, owing to the short lifetime, they do not remain in the product mixture. For example, consider this hypothetical stepwise reaction: A + B → C + D The reaction includes these elementary steps: A + B → X* X* → C + D The chemical species X* is an intermediate.",

A very old named reaction is the Claisen rearrangement (1912) and a recent named reaction is the Bingel reaction (1993). When the named reaction is difficult to pronounce or very long as in the Corey-House-Posner-Whitesides reaction it helps to use the abbreviation as in the CBS reduction. The number of reactions hinting at the actual process taking place is much smaller, for example the ene reaction or aldol reaction. Another approach to organic reactions is by type of organic reagent, many of them inorganic, required in a specific transformation. The major types are oxidizing agents such as osmium tetroxide, reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, bases such as lithium diisopropylamide and acids such as sulfuric acid.",

Reaction mechanism and scope The benzyl halide 1 reacts with hexamine to a quaternary ammonium salt 3, each time just alkylating one nitrogen atom. Then the benzylammonium undergoes an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis process. Depending on the hydrolysis conditions, the hexamine unit might instead break apart, leaving a benzyl amine (the Delépine reaction). The reaction can also be applied to the oxidation of benzylic amines. In this way, m-xylylenediamine can be converted to isophthalaldehyde. References Organic reactions Name reactions",

The final product is a β-amino-carbonyl compound also known as a Mannich base. Reactions between aldimines and α-methylene carbonyls are also considered Mannich reactions because these imines form between amines and aldehydes. The reaction is named after chemist Carl Mannich. The Mannich reaction is an example of nucleophilic addition of an amine to a carbonyl group followed by dehydration to the Schiff base. The Schiff base is an electrophile which reacts in the second step in an electrophilic addition with a compound containing an acidic proton (which is, or had become an enol). The Mannich reaction is also considered a condensation reaction.",
