E3 ligase is recruited to the AR by the E3 ligase recognition moiety and the AR target protein is tagged by ubiquitin. This causes ubiquitination and degradation of AR by the proteasome. This prevents the expression of AR target genes and halts AR-mediated signaling. This results in an inhibition of proliferation in AR-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the degradation of the AR protein releases the ARV-110 is released and can bind to additional AR target proteins.

E3 ligase is recruited to the AR by the E3 ligase recognition moiety and the AR target protein is tagged by ubiquitin. This causes ubiquitination and degradation of AR by the proteasome. This prevents the expression of AR target genes and halts AR-mediated signaling. This results in an inhibition of proliferation in AR-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the degradation of the AR protein releases the ARV-110 is released and can bind to additional AR target proteins.

This inhibits the activation of CCR2/CCR5-mediated signal transduction pathways and may inhibit inflammatory processes. The G-protein coupled chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 are expressed on the surface of monocytes and macrophages and stimulate their migration and infiltration; they play key roles in inflammation and autoimmune diseases.

Upon oral administration, cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase modulating agent CFT7455 specifically binds to cereblon (CRBN), thereby affecting the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, and targeting certain substrate proteins for ubiquitination. This induces proteasome-mediated degradation of certain transcription factors, including Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), which are transcriptional repressors in T-cells. This reduces the levels of these transcription factors, and modulates the activity of the immune system, which may include the activation of T-lymphocytes. This also leads to downregulation of the activity of other proteins, some of which play key roles in the proliferation of certain cancer cell types. CRBN, the substrate recognition component of the CRL4-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, plays a key role in the ubiquitination of certain proteins.']",

E3 ligase is recruited to the AR by the E3 ligase recognition moiety and the AR target protein is tagged by ubiquitin. This causes ubiquitination and degradation of AR by the proteasome. This prevents the expression of AR target genes and halts AR-mediated signaling. This results in an inhibition of proliferation in AR-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the degradation of the AR protein releases the ARV-110 is released and can bind to additional AR target proteins.

The goal of using of aprotinin was subsequently to minimize end-organ damage resulting from hypotension due to blood loss in surgery and to reduce the necessity for blood transfusions during surgery. Nevertheless, the drug was formally withdrawn worldwide in May of 2008 after studies confirmed that its use enhanced the risk of complications or death.

It is a derivative of the marine-derived agent ecteinascidin ([trabectedin]), an anticancer agent found in extracts of the tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata, with the primary difference being the substitution of the tetrahydroisoquinoline with a tetrahydro β‐carboline that results in increased antitumour activity of lurbinectedin as compared to its predecessor.  On June 15, 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval and orphan drug designation to lurbinectedin for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic SCLC who have experienced disease progression despite therapy with platinum-based agents. This accelerated approval is based on the rate and duration of therapeutic response observed in ongoing clinical trials and is contingent on the verification of these results in confirmatory trials.']",

Bavdegalutamide is composed of an AR ligand attached to an E3 ligase recognition moiety. Upon oral administration, bavdegalutamide targets and binds to the AR ligand binding domain. E3 ligase is recruited to the AR by the E3 ligase recognition moiety and the AR target protein is tagged by ubiquitin. This causes ubiquitination and degradation of AR by the proteasome. This prevents the expression of AR target genes and halts AR-mediated signaling. This results in an inhibition of proliferation in AR-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the degradation of the AR protein releases the ARV-110 is released and can bind to additional AR target proteins. AR plays a key role in the proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (CRPC).']",

It is hepatotoxic, although found to be up to 10-fold less toxic than microcystin-LR on intraperitoneal injection injection in mice. It is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Microcystins (also known as cyanoginosins) are a class of toxins produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria. Microcystins are chemically stable over a wide range of temperature and pH, possibly as a result of their cyclic structure. The toxins are also resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis (in guts of animals) by some general proteases, such as pepsin, trypsin, collagenase, and chymotrypsin.']",

Because ginsenosides appear to affect multiple pathways, their effects are complex and difficult to isolate. Rb1 appears to be most abundant in Panax quinquefolius (American Ginseng). Rb1 seems to affect the reproductive system in animal testicles. Recent research shows that Rb1 affects rat embryo development and has teratogenic effects, causing birth defects.

E3 ligase is recruited to the AR by the E3 ligase recognition moiety and the AR target protein is tagged by ubiquitin. This causes ubiquitination and degradation of AR by the proteasome. This prevents the expression of AR target genes and halts AR-mediated signaling. This results in an inhibition of proliferation in AR-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, the degradation of the AR protein releases the ARV-110 is released and can bind to additional AR target proteins.

Upon intravenous administration, AKR1C3-activated prodrug OBI-3424 is converted to its active form by AKR1C3, which is upregulated in certain tumor cell types while not expressed in normal healthy cells. The active metabolite selectively binds to and alkylates DNA in AKR1C3-overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in DNA base pair mismatching, interstrand crosslinking and inhibition of DNA repair and synthesis, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. As the expression of AKR1C3 is restricted to tumors, OBI-3424 is selectively converted to its active metabolite in tumor cells only while its conversion in normal, healthy tissue is absent; this allows for an increased cytotoxic effect of the alkylating agent in tumor cells while decreasing its toxicity.\"]",

Upon oral administration, zapnometinib selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK. This may prevent the export of the viral genome protein complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting the formation of new viral particles and the replication of various RNA viruses, including influenza virus, hantavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition, the inhibition of the activity of MEK may also decrease gene expression and inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1-beta, IL-8, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (interferon gamma-induced protein 10; IP-10), C-C motif chemokine 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCP-1) and C-C motif chemokine 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha; MIP-1a), thereby reducing inflammation. MEK, a dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinase family, plays a key role in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Many RNA viruses rely on this pathway inside human cells to replicate.']",

It is a potent synthetic agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with 3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine substitution at residue 6. Nafarelin has been used in the treatments of central precocious puberty and endometriosis. [PubChem]Like GnRH, initial or intermittent administration of nafarelin stimulates release of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland, which in turn transiently increases production of estradiol in females and testosterone in both sexes. However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. This causes a significant and sustained decline in the production of LH and FSH. A decline in gonadotropin production and release causes a dramatic reversible decrease in synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone by the ovaries or testes. Like normal endometrium, endometriotic implants contain estrogen receptors. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. Use of nafarelin induces anovulation and amenorrhea and decreases serum concentrations of estradiol to the postmenopausal range, which induces atrophy of endometriotic implants. However, nafarelin does not abolish the underlying pathophysiology of endometriosis. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels. This results in the supression of secondary sexual characteristics and decrased rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation. Following disconinuation of nafarelin, the effects of the drug is reversed, meaning FSH and LH concentrations usually return to pretreatment levels.']",
