Upon subcutaneous administration, roneparstat inhibits the activity of heparanase. This prevents the heparanase-mediated cleavage of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans on cell surfaces and within the extracellular matrix. In addition, this agent prevents the heparanase-induced production of a number of angiogenic growth factors, including matrix metalloproteinase-9, hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. Altogether, this leads to an inhibition of both tumor cell growth and angiogenesis. Heparanase, an enzyme that is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of proteoglycans, is upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types and promotes tumor cell growth; it plays a key role in tumor cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis.']",

                    "contents": "Name: Insulin human\nDescription: ['Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.  Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.   Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas\\' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.  Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA \"black box\" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU.   Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds.   Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.  Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.']",

Upon oral administration of pacritinib hydrochloride, pacritinib competes with JAK2 and the JAK2 mutant JAK2V617F for ATP binding, which may result in inhibition of JAK2 activation, inhibition of the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, pacritinib targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of FLT3. This inhibits FLT3-mediated signaling and the proliferation of FLT3-expressing cancer cells. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The JAK2V617F gain-of-function mutation involves a valine-to-phenylalanine modification at position 617. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a major mediator of cytokine activity. FLT3, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is overexpressed or mutated in most B-lineage neoplasms and in acute myeloid leukemias. In addition, JAK2 and FLT3 play a key role in the regulation of the inflammatory response and dendritic cell (DC) proliferation, differentiation and function. Inhibition of JAK2- and FLT3-mediated signaling may suppress the generation and differentiation of DCs, and may regulate inflammatory and immune responses.']",

After completing various phase-II and phase-III trials demonstrating its effectiveness in treating moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris the US Food and Drug Administration approved Barcelona based Almirall, S.A.'s Seysara (sarecylcine) as a new first in class narrow spectrum tetracycline derived oral antibiotic for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. Seysara (sarecycline) was originally part of Allergan's US Medical Dermatology portfolio, before Almirall acquired the portfolio in the second half of 2018 as a means of consolidating and reinforcing the dermatology-focused pharmaceutical company's presence in the United States.  Acne vulgaris itself is a common chronic skin condition associated with the blockage and/or inflammation of hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous glands. The acne often presents physically as a mixture of non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions mainly on the face but on the back and chest as well. Based upon data from Global Burden of Disease studies, the acne vulgaris condition affects up to 85% of young adults aged 12 to 25 years globally - with the possibility of permanent physical and mental scarring resulting from cases of severe acne.  Subsequently, while a number of first line tetracycline therapies like doxycycline and minocycline do exist for treating acne vulgaris, sarecycline presents a new and innovative therapy choice because it exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against relevant pathogens that cause acne vulgaris but also possesses a low propensity for resistance development in such pathogens and a narrower, more specific spectrum of antibacterial activity, resulting in fewer off-target antibacterial effects on endogenous intestinal flora and consequently fewer resultant adverse effects associated with diarrhea, fungal overgrowth, etc.\"]",

Loxoribine undergoes facilitated transport across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell and acts intracellularly, bypassing the biochemical steps involved in the membrane signal transduction pathway used by Ag or anti-IgM Abs to activate B cells. This agent activates the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a member of the TLR family of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors thereby activating the innate immune system. This activation requires endosomal maturation and recognition is restricted to TLR7. As a result, loxoribine induces cycling B cells to proliferate and differentiate non-specifically and recruit antigen-reactive B cells to undergo differentiation to antibody production, markedly amplifying the underlying response in the process.']",

Type I and II 5α-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. Dutasteride was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as monotherapy or in combination with the α-adrenergic antagonist [tamsulosin] to enhance the therapeutic response. Its clinical efficacy against benign prostate hyperplasia in male patients is comparable to that of [finasteride], a specific type II 5α-reductase inhibitor. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.']",

Ceftazidime binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, resulting in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and cell lysis. Compared to the second and first generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime is more active against gram-negative bacteria and less active against gram-positive bacteria. Ceftazidine also crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches therapeutic concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS). PBPs participate in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall, and in reshaping the cell wall during cell division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity.']",

Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. The activity of cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus is due to its high stability toward beta-lactamases. In general, cefepime seems to be well tolerated; however, patients treated with this antibiotic, especially those with renal impairment, may develop neurotoxicity.']",

Similar to carbenicillin in action, ticarcillin inactivates the penicillin-sensitive transpeptidase C-terminal domain by opening the lactam ring. This inactivation prevents the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan strands, thereby inhibiting the third and last stage of bacterial cell wall synthesis. This leads to incomplete bacterial cell wall synthesis and eventually causes cell lysis.",

The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Linkage of antibody and drug through a nonreducible linker has been reported to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this ADC compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers.']",

The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Linkage of antibody and drug through a nonreducible linker has been reported to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this ADC compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers.']",

Omidenepag isopropyl is quickly metabolized to its active metabolite, omidenepag, a molecule with high selectivity and agonistic activity towards the prostaglandin E2 (EP2) receptor. Prostanoid FP receptor agonists (FP agonists), such as [latanoprost], are part of the first-line therapy for ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma; however, not all patients achieve adequate IOP reduction with FP agonists and require changes in treatment. The use of an EP2 receptor agonist such as omidenepag represents an alternative in these scenarios. Omidenepag IOP-lowering effect is comparable to the one observed with [latanoprost]. In 2018, omidenepag isopropyl was approved in Japan for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. In September 2022, the FDA approved the use of omidenepag isopropyl.']",

This drug is considered a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and is thought to play a role in suppressing the central nervous system inflammation that is associated with MS.  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is chronic and inflammatory, disrupting communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Most patients diagnosed with this illness experience their initial disease symptoms between the age of 20 to 40, often the most productive years of life. Symptoms may include but are not limited to fatigue, gait changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, abnormal muscle twitching, vision disturbance, and depressing or mood swings. MS is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and is found to occur more frequently in women than in men.']",

Upon oral administration, PI3Kdelta inhibitor GS-9901 selectively binds to the delta isoform of PI3K and inhibits its activity. This inhibits the activation of the PI3Kdelta-mediated signaling pathway and prevents proliferation of PI3Kdelta-overexpressing tumor cells. Unlike other isoforms of PI3K, PI3Kdelta is expressed primarily in certain tumor cell types and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation, motility and survival. The targeted inhibition of PI3Kdelta is designed to preserve PI3K signaling in normal, non-neoplastic cells and thus reduces toxicity to normal, healthy cells.']",

The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2.

This disrupts chromatin remodeling and gene expression. Prevention of the expression of certain growth-promoting genes may lead to an inhibition of proliferation in BET-overexpressing tumor cells. BET proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) are transcriptional regulators that contain two homologous bromodomains, the BD1 and BD2 domains.
