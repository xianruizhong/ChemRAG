The dilactide derived from lactic acid (with the formula (OCHMeCO2)2) exists in three different stereoisomeric forms. All are colorless or white solids.

We report a hypoglycaemic clamp study in seven healthy controls and 10 people with T2D. Blood was withdrawn at four time points: at baseline after an overnight fast; after clamping to euglycaemia at 5 mmol/L; after clamping to hypoglycaemia at 2.8 mmol/L; and 24\u2009hours later, after overnight fast. Deep molecular phenotyping using non-targeted metabolomics and the SomaLogic aptamer-based proteomics platform was performed on collected samples. A total of 955 metabolites and 1125 proteins were identified, with significant alterations in &gt;90 molecules. A number of metabolites significantly increased during hypoglycaemia, but only cortisol, adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP), and pregnenolone sulphate, were independent of insulin. By contrast, identified protein changes were triggered by hypoglycaemia rather than insulin. The T2D group had significantly higher levels of fatty acids including 10-nonadecenoate, linolenate and dihomo-linoleate during hypoglycaemia compared with the control group. Molecules contributing to cardiovascular complications such as fatty-acid-binding protein-3 and pregnenolone sulphate were altered in the participants with T2D during hypoglycaemia. Almost all molecules returned to baseline at 24\u2009hours. The present study provides a comprehensive description of molecular events that are triggered by insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. We identified deregulated pathways in T2D that may play a role in the pathophysiology of hypoglycaemia-induced cardiovascular complications.",

Prototype I comprises cone-shaped molecules, BMe 3 as an example for a Lewis acid and PMe 3 as an example for a Lewis base.

Design 3 is suitable for the combination of a prototype I molecule and a prototype II molecule, e.g. BMe 3 and a NHC, with V corr being a convex lens V cl (design 3). Prototype III molecules are sterically overcrowded and thus have a % V Bur of more than 50%. Examination of a combination of a prototype I and a prototype III molecule leads to an approximation of V corr as a half-segment V hseg (design 4). For the pair of a prototype II and a prototype III molecule, the volume of a half-biconvex lens V hbcl (design 5) should be applied as correction volume (Fig. 8). To take into account that prototype III molecules extend into the hemisphere of the potential adduct partner when their %V bur exceeds 50%, an empirical correction was introduced for the correction volumes V corr of design 4 V hseg and design 5 V hbcl (for details including the mathematical description of the \ue103ve designs see the ESI \u2020). The distance h between the different types of correction volumes was estimated to be d/2 (Fig. 8). This estimation gives very accurate results, as outlined below. In principle, the combination of a prototype III Lewis base with a prototype III Lewis acid is possible.

                    "contents": "Name: Insulin human\nDescription: ['Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.  Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as [DB00331], [DB01120], or [DB01261] have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own.   Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered \"bolus insulin\" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting \"basal insulin\" such as [DB01307], [DB09564], and [DB00047] to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas\\' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.  Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets. Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA \"black box\" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU.   Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds.   Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.  Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy.']",

Upon oral administration of pacritinib hydrochloride, pacritinib competes with JAK2 and the JAK2 mutant JAK2V617F for ATP binding, which may result in inhibition of JAK2 activation, inhibition of the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, and the induction of apoptosis. In addition, pacritinib targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of FLT3. This inhibits FLT3-mediated signaling and the proliferation of FLT3-expressing cancer cells. JAK2, often upregulated or mutated in a variety of cancer cells, plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. The JAK2V617F gain-of-function mutation involves a valine-to-phenylalanine modification at position 617. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is a major mediator of cytokine activity. FLT3, a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), is overexpressed or mutated in most B-lineage neoplasms and in acute myeloid leukemias. In addition, JAK2 and FLT3 play a key role in the regulation of the inflammatory response and dendritic cell (DC) proliferation, differentiation and function. Inhibition of JAK2- and FLT3-mediated signaling may suppress the generation and differentiation of DCs, and may regulate inflammatory and immune responses.']",

Identification, assay, pathway, and some enzyme properties.\nProstaglandin F2alpha is converted to 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin E2 by adult rat kidney homogenates. A variety of substrates labeled as either the 9beta position alone or at several other positions in the prostaglandin molecule were used to define the step at which the crossover from the F type to the E type prostaglandins takes place. Time course studies further confirmed that 15-keto-13,14-dihydroprostaglandin F2alpha is the immediate substrate for this enzyme which we have termed prostaglandin 9-hydroxydehydrogenase. An assay system based on specific loss of tritium from 9beta-tritiated prostaglandin F2alpha is described. Enzyme activity with prostaglandin F2alpha as substrate is linear with time up to 10 min, stimulated by NAD+, saturable at low concentrations of substrate, stable to storage at minus 25 degrees in phosphate buffer (up to 3 weeks), and has a broad pH optimum around 7.5. The product, 15-keto,13,14-dihydroprostaglandin E2 was identified by mass spectrometry through a sodium borohydride-sodium borodeuteride reduction method.",

While this specification allowed for facile annotation of bonds with properties and descriptors, it resulted in significant search performance hits, forcing us to reconsider elements of our specification. As a result, we have created a test set where, apart from specifying explicit bonds, we also linked bonded atom instances with the appropriate bidirectional relationships that corresponded to bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic). This improved performance considerably and allowed us to carry out our tests. Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2). It must be noted that answering this query in a typical SPARQL engine involves the exhaustive examination of all the candidate molecules that may potentially contain a collection of atoms that satisfy the laid out bonding criteria. Unfortunately, since the SPARQL query engines currently available have not been explicitly optimized chemical searching needs, they often lack many of the mechanisms developed over the past decades to accelerate the solution of this problem, and resemble the brute force approach to graph matching more closely.\n\nAppendix 2.

An alternative approach to the problem, taking into account the inertial properties of the nematic molecules, allows one to satisfy the initial boundary conditions on the first-order time derivative of the tilt angle. In this framework the dynamical evolution of the nematic deformation, in the initial time, depends on the inertial properties of the nematic molecules. However, the typical relaxation time is so short that, for all practical effects, the first time derivative of the tilt angle is discontinuous at t=0 . A more realistic description involves the switching time of the distorting field. In this framework, the initial boundary condition of the first-order derivative is automatically satisfied.

The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based upon the antibacterial sulfonamides. Allergies to sulfonamides are common. The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully. Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine. Function",

Discovered in 1801, this concept is also known as Dalton's law of partial pressures. Dalton also proposed a modern atomic theory in 1803 which stated that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles termed atoms, atoms of a given element possess unique characteristics and weight, and three types of atoms exist: simple (elements), compound (simple molecules), and complex (complex molecules). In 1808, Dalton first published New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808-1827), in which he outlined the first modern scientific description of the atomic theory. This work identified chemical elements as a specific type of atom, therefore rejecting Newton's theory of chemical affinities.",

Given the importance of molecular shape in the description of spatial interactions in crystals or ligand-target complexes, this is not a satisfying state. In the current work, we propose a novel application of alpha shapes to the description of the shapes of small molecules. Alpha shapes are parametrized generalizations of the convex hull. For a specific value of alpha, the alpha shape is the geometric dual of the space-filling model of a molecule, with the parameter alpha allowing description of shape in varying degrees of detail. To date, alpha shapes have been used to find macromolecular cavities and to estimate molecular surface areas and volumes. We developed a novel methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. In this work, we show that alpha-shape descriptors reveal aspects of molecular shape that are complementary to other shape descriptors and that accord well with chemists' intuition about shape. While our implementation of alpha-shape descriptors is not computationally trivial, we suggest that the additional shape characteristics they provide can be used to improve and complement shape-analysis methods in domains such as crystallography and ligand-target interactions. In this communication, we present a unique methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. We first describe details of the alpha-shape calculation, an outline of validation experiments performed, and a discussion of the advantages and challenges we found while implementing this approach. The results show that, relative to known shape calculations, this method provides a high degree of shape resolution with even small changes in atomic coordinates.",

From six-dimensional solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we show that diffraction of H<sub2</sub molecules under fast grazing incidence conditions could be even more informative for the characterization of ionic surfaces, due to the large anisotropic electrostatic interaction between the quadrupole moment of the molecule and the electric field created by the ionic crystal. Using the LiF(001) surface as a benchmark, we show that fast grazing incidence diffraction of H<sub2</sub strongly depends on the initial rotational state of the molecule, while rotationally inelastic processes are irrelevant. We demonstrate that, as a result of the anisotropy of the impinging projectile, initial rotational excitation leads to an increase in intensity of high-order diffraction peaks at incidence directions that satisfy precise symmetry constraints, thus providing a more detailed information on the surface characteristics than that obtained from low-order atomic diffraction peaks under fast grazing incidence conditions. As quadrupole-ion surface potentials are expected to accurately represent the interaction between H<sub2</sub and any surface with a marked ionic character, our analysis should be of general applicability to any of such surfaces.

This tool is very well suited for simple diatomic molecules such as dihydrogen, dioxygen, and carbon monoxide but becomes more complex when discussing even comparatively simple polyatomic molecules, such as methane. MO diagrams can explain why some molecules exist and others do not. They can also predict bond strength, as well as the electronic transitions that can take place.",

The complexes of ligand molecules with such nanocarriers were characterized by much lower values of binding affinity than those created by CNT. This phenomenon can be largely explained by the size of the considered nanoparticles and the geometry of the molecules determining the exposure of the fullerene aromatic systems. The analyzed functionalized fullerenes clearly demonstrated the group of potential modifications that exhibit significant potential in increasing of binding capacity of C 60 molecule. The addition of a single aromatic system on the surface of the fullerene considerably increased binding affinity toward the ligand molecule, relative to native fullerene. The addition of multiple aromatic systems contributed to the achievement of even better binding abilities of the considered nanosystems. Another class of modifications were substituents containing hydrogen bond donors and acceptors; however, the observed effects were less satisfactory, which was due to lower affinity values relative to nanostructures with aromatic substituents and the lack of any conformation of ligands that ensured the formation of hydrogen bonds. Such observations clearly confirm that in the case of this particular ligand molecule, the most important interactions are stacking interactions between aromatic moieties.\n\nThe last group of considered nanosytems, namely cube rhombellane homeomorphs, showed the lowest binding capacity relative to the ligand molecule. A large group of proposed compounds exhibited satisfying binding affinity towards the ligand molecule. The binding capacity of these nanostructures is strictly related with the structure of the external shell of these molecules.

This approach frequently becomes inaccurate when some molecular species are present in low molecule numbers per cell because of the randomness inherent in chemical reaction kinetics.

The more accurate stochastic description of these systems is given by the Chemical Master Equation. The latter can be easily simulated by means of Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm. This method, however, often becomes computationally inefficient due to the large amount of sampling needed for accurate statistics. iNA provides a more efficient way to obtain the desired statistics via the system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation, a systematic analytical approximation method.

Although patients affected by this disorder predominantly present central and peripheral demyelination as well as adrenal insufficiency, the mechanisms underlying the brain damage in X-ALD are poorly known. The current treatment of X-ALD with glyceroltrioleate (C(18:1))/glyceroltrierucate (C(22:1)) (Lorenzo's oil, LO) combined with a VLCFA-poor diet normalizes VLCFA concentrations, but the neurological symptoms persist or even progress in symptomatic patients. Considering that free radical generation is involved in various neurodegenerative disorders and that in a previous study we showed evidence that oxidative stress is probably involved in the pathophysiology of X-ALD symptomatic patients, in the present study we evaluated various oxidative stress parameters, namely thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBA-RS) and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) in plasma, as well as the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes from symptomatic and asymptomatic X-ALD patients and verified whether LO treatment and a VLCFA restricted diet could change these parameters. We observed a significant increase of plasma TBA-RS in symptomatic and asymptomatic X-ALD patients, reflecting induction of lipid peroxidation even before the disease was manifested. In addition, LO treatment did not alter this profile. Furthermore, plasma TAR measurement of X-ALD patients was not different from that of controls. Similarly, the antioxidant enzyme activities CAT, SOD and GPx were not altered in erythrocyte from X-ALD patients as compared to controls. We also examined the in vitro effects of hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) and tetracosanoic acid (C(24:0)) alone or combined with oleic (C(18:1))/erucic (C(22:1)) acids on various oxidative stress parameters in cerebral cortex of young rats, namely chemiluminescence, TBA-RS, TAR, CAT, SOD and GPx in order to investigate whether those fatty acids were able to induce oxidative stress. We found that there was a significant increase of TBARS and of chemiluminescence in rat cerebral cortex exposed to C(26:0)/C(24:0), and that the addition of C(18:1)and C(22:1) to the assays did not prevent this effect. Furthermore, TAR measurement was not altered by C(26:0) and C(24:0) acids in rat cerebral cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that lipid peroxidation occurs in X-ALD and that LO treatment does not attenuate or prevent free radical generation in these patients. Therefore, it may be presumed that antioxidants should be considered as an adjuvant therapy for X-ALD patients.",

Previous studies analysed the development of X-ALD in humans and gene knockout animal models. However, the toxic effect of VLCFA leading to severe symptoms with progressive and multifocal demyelination, adrenal insufficiency and inflammation still remains unclear. To understand the toxic effects of VLCFA in the brain, here we exposed neural cells to VLCFA and analysed the cellular consequences. We found that oligodendrocytes and astrocytes challenged with docosanoic- (C22:0), tetracosanoic- (C24:0) and hexacosanoic acids (C24:0) die within 24 h. VLCFA-induced depolarization of mitochondria in situ and increased intracellular Ca2+ level in all three brain cell types provides indications about the mechanism of toxicity of VLCFA. Interestingly, VLCFAs affect to the largest degree the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. In isolated mitochondria, VLCFAs exert a detrimental effect by affecting the inner mitochondrial membrane and promoting the permeability transition. In conclusion, we suggest that there is a potent toxic activity of VLCFA due to dramatic cell physiological effects with mitochondrial dysfunction and Ca2+ deregulation. This provides the first evidence for mitochondrial-based cell death mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease with peroxisomal defects and subsequent VLCFA accumulation.",

Among these lipids, phosphatidylcholine showed the most diversity in the structures of VLCFA-containing molecular species. Some VLCFA possessed longer carbon chains and/or larger number of double bonds than C 26:0-fatty acid (FA). Similar VLCFA were also found in other phospholipid classes, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. In addition, VLCFA-containing phospholipid species showed some differences among fibroblasts from Zellweger patients.

It ranges from a rapidly progressive and fatal cerebral demyelinating disease in childhood (CCALD), to the milder slowly progressive form in adulthood (AMN). X-ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene that encodes a peroxisomal membrane located ABC half-transporter named ALDP. Mutations in ALDP result in reduced beta-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA, &gt;22 carbon atoms) in peroxisomes and elevated levels of VLCFA in plasma and tissues. Previously, it has been shown that culturing skin fibroblasts from X-ALD patients in lipoprotein-deficient medium results in reduced VLCFA levels and increased expression of the functionally redundant ALD-related protein (ALDRP). The aim of this study was to further resolve the interaction between cholesterol and VLCFA metabolism in X-ALD. Our data show that the reduction in 26:0 in X-ALD fibroblasts grown in lipoprotein-deficient culture medium (free of cholesterol) is offset by a significant increase in both the level and synthesis of 26:1. We also demonstrate that cholesterol-deprivation results in increased expression of stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) and increased desaturation of 18:0 to 18:1.

Fatty acids can be provided by food or result from dysfunction of organelles. A disorder of \u03b2-oxidation, which occurs in the peroxisome, results in an increase in VLCFA concentration. VLCFA status is expressed as the ratio between the levels of C26:0 (hexacosanoic acid or cerotic acid) and C22:0 (docosanoic acid or behenic acid). Most hereditary peroxisomal disorders result in an increase in VLCFA. Alterations in peroxisomal function are also suspected of contributing in the etiology of various neurodegenerative diseases: (a) multiple sclerosis: high concentrations of C26:0 are present in grey matter as well as in serum [1,2], (b) Alzheimer's disease: there is an accumulation of C22:0, C24:0 (tetracosanoic acid or lignoceric acid) and C26:0 [3], (c) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD): there is an accumulation of C24:0, C26:0 and C26:1, in tissue and plasma caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, (d) dementia: there are higher levels of C26:0 in the plasma and red blood cells [4]. In these different pathologies, the central and/or peripheral nervous system is affected and undergoes demyelination. Oligodendrocytes are the cells that synthesize myelin and are therefore impacted by the lipotoxicity of VLCFA. Our laboratory and others have shown that VLCFA induces cell death associated with changes in plasma membrane, mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress, and late apoptosis. Recently, we have shown that cells utilize autophagy to protect themselves from VLCFA-induced lipotoxicity [5]. Oxidative stress, being a common element in different neurodegenerative diseases, has been the target for therapies.

In this study, we investigated the role of VLCFA biosynthesis in X-ALD fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that elongation of both saturated and mono-unsaturated VLCFAs is enhanced in fibroblasts from patients with peroxisomal beta-oxidation defects including X-ALD, and peroxisome biogenesis disorders. These data indicate that enhanced VLCFA elongation is a general phenomenon associated with an impairment in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and not specific for X-ALD alone. Analysis of plasma samples from patients with X-ALD and different peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies revealed increased concentrations of VLCFAs up to 32 carbons. We infer that enhanced elongation does not result from impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation alone, but is due to the additional effect of unchecked chain elongation. We demonstrate that elongated VLCFAs are incorporated into complex lipids. The role of chain elongation was also studied retrospectively in samples from patients with X-ALD previously treated with \"Lorenzo's oil.\" We found that the decrease in plasma C26:0 previously found is offset by the increase of mono-unsaturated VLCFAs, not measured previously during the trial. We conclude that evaluation of treatment protocols for disorders of peroxisomal beta-oxidation making use of plasma samples should include the measurement of saturated and unsaturated VLCFAs of chain lengths above 26 carbon atoms. We also conclude that chain elongation offers an interesting target to be studied as a possible mode of treatment for X-ALD and other peroxisomal beta-oxidation disorders.",

Hexacosanoic acid plasma level was significantly reduced when compared with that at diagnosis and achieved the normal levels only in asymptomatic patients under LO treatment. In asymptomatic patients the magnitude of hexacosanoic acid decrease was higher than that of the CCER patients.

LC-MS/MS-based analysis showed that phosphatidylcholine (PC) containing VLCFA signals, such as PC 40\u2009:\u20090(24\u2009:\u20090/16\u2009:\u20090), PC 42\u2009:\u20090(26\u2009:\u20090/16\u2009:\u20090), PC 44\u2009:\u20094(24\u2009:\u20090/20\u2009:\u20094) and PC 46\u2009:\u20094(26\u2009:\u20090/20\u2009:\u20094) were characteristically detected only in the CSF from patients with X- ALD. In the present study, we analyzed limited number of patient's CSF samples (2 patients with X-ALD) due to the limitations of the availability for CSF samples from this rare disease. However, our finding would offer helpful information for studying the disease progression biomarkers in X-ALD. To our knowledge, this is the first report of analyzing lipids containing VLCFA in CSF from patients with X-ALD.",

X-ALD is characterized by the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; &gt; or =C24) in plasma and tissues. In this manuscript we provide insight into the pathway underlying the elevated levels of C26:0 in X-ALD. ALDP transports VLCFacyl-CoA across the peroxisomal membrane. A deficiency in ALDP impairs peroxisomal beta-oxidation of VLCFA but also raises cytosolic levels of VLCFacyl-CoA which are substrate for further elongation. We identify ELOVL1 (elongation of very-long-chain-fatty acids) as the single elongase catalysing the synthesis of both saturated VLCFA (C26:0) and mono-unsaturated VLCFA (C26:1). ELOVL1 expression is not increased in X-ALD fibroblasts suggesting that increased levels of C26:0 result from increased substrate availability due to the primary deficiency in ALDP. Importantly, ELOVL1 knockdown reduces elongation of C22:0 to C26:0 and lowers C26:0 levels in X-ALD fibroblasts. Given the likely pathogenic effects of high C26:0 levels, our findings highlight the potential of modulating ELOVL1 activity in the treatment of X-ALD.",

We show that SV40T transformation also results in impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation and VLCFA accumulation despite the presence of abundant peroxisomes. To explore the mechanism responsible for this observation, we have examined expression of key components of peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation. We found that expression of both acyl-CoA oxidase, the rate limiting enzyme of peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation and the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP), the defective gene product in X-ALD, are reduced after SV40T transformation. Surprisingly, ALDP overexpression by itself restores peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in SV40T-transformed control and X-ALD cells. These results demonstrate that ALDP is a fundamental component in VLCFA peroxisomal beta-oxidation and may serve as a \"gatekeeper\" for VLCFA homeostasis.",

This can trigger other pathological processes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which if involves the brain tissues can result in a lethal form of the disease called childhood cerebral ALD. With the recent addition of ALD to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel, there is an increase in the number of individuals who are identified with ALD. However, currently, there is no approved treatment for pre-symptomatic individuals that can arrest or delay symptom development. Here, we report our observations investigating nervonic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid as a potential therapy for ALD. Using ALD patient-derived fibroblasts, we examined whether nervonic acid can reverse VLCFA accumulation similar to erucic acid, the active ingredient in Lorenzo's oil, a dietary intervention believed to alter disease course. We have shown that nervonic acid can reverse total lipid C26:0 accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner in ALD cell lines. Further, we show that nervonic acid can protect ALD fibroblasts from oxidative insults, presumably by increasing intracellular ATP production. Thus, nervonic acid can be a potential therapeutic for individuals with ALD, which can alter cellular biochemistry and improve its function.",

The consistent metabolic abnormality in all forms of X-ALD is an inherited defect in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long chain (VLC) fatty acids (&gt;C(22:0)) which may in turn lead to a neuroinflammatory process associated with demyelination of the cerebral white matter. The current treatment for X-ALD with Lorenzo's oil aims to lower the excessive quantities of VLC fatty acids that accumulate in the patients' plasma and tissues, but does not directly address the inflammatory process in X-ALD. We have previously demonstrated that lovastatin and other 3-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are capable of normalizing VLC fatty acid levels in primary skin fibroblasts derived from X-ALD patients. Lovastatin can block the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase and proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages in vitro. In a preliminary report, we demonstrated that lovastatin therapy can normalize VLC fatty acids in the plasma of patients with X-ALD. Here we report our clinical and biochemical observations on 12 patients with X-ALD who were treated with lovastatin for up to 12 months. Our results show that the high plasma levels of hexacosanoic acid (C(26:0)) showed a decline from pretreatment values within 1 to 3 months of starting therapy with 40 mg of lovastatin per day and stabilized at various levels during a period of observation up to 12 months. The percentage decline from pretreatment values varied and did not correlate with the type of ALD gene mutation (point mutation versus gene deletion). In 6 patients, in whom red cell membrane fatty acid composition was studied, a mean correction of 50% of the excess C(26:0) was observed after 6 months of therapy suggesting sustained benefit. In a few patients who discontinued lovastatin therapy plasma C(26:0) levels reverted to pretreatment values suggesting a cause and effect relationship between these events. Two patients dropped out of the study claiming no clinical benefit, 1 was withdrawn due to adverse effects, and an adult patient with cerebral involvement died during the study. A 10-year-old boy with severe cerebral involvement showed worsening of his neurological status. All patients with AMN remained neurologically stable or showed modest subjective improvement. All patients who did not have Addison's disease at the time of enrollment maintained normal adrenal function throughout the study. The implications of our findings for developing an effective therapy for X-ALD are discussed.",

Even longer chain fatty acids with from 30 to 38 carbon atoms (ultra-long-chain fatty acids, ULCFA) are found in certain specialized tissues including retina, brain, and spermatozoa. In patients with inherited defects in peroxisomal structure and/or function, there is an accumulation of VLCFA in most tissues, while VLCFA and ULCFA levels are increased in brain. The most pronounced changes occur in those patients who have defects in peroxisomal assembly (Zellweger syndrome, infantile Refsum's disease, and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy). In the brain of these individuals, ULCFA are distributed largely in molecular species of phosphatidylcholine with penta-, hexa-, and heptaenoic acids. In contrast, patients with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy have increased levels of phosphatidylcholine with monoenoic rather than polyenoic ULCFA. A defect in a peroxisomal VLCFA CoA synthetase or ligase has been reported for these patients, but assembly of their peroxisomes is apparently normal. We speculate that ULCFA are normal products of carbon chain elongation. We have confirmed this by demonstrating the elongation of [1-14C]hexacosatetraenoic acid (26:4n-6) by rat brain in vivo to a series of longer chain tetraenoic acids with carbon chain lengths up to 34. Elongation to ULCFA can occur as well in non-neural tissues as shown by detection of labeled saturated and monoenoic fatty acids with up to 32 carbon atoms after incubation of normal and Zellweger syndrome fibroblasts with [2-14C] acetate. Increased labeling of VLCFA and ULCFA is observed in cells from patients with peroxisomal disorders. Our data suggest that ULCFA with up to at least 32 carbon atoms are formed normally, as a part of the elongation process in most mammalian tissues, and that control of carbon chain elongation is a major function of peroxisomes. Impairment of this function as occurs in peroxisomal disease results in the accumulation of VLCFA and ULCFA. The relative enrichment in normal tissues of ULCFA such as 32:6n-3 in ram and bull spermatozoa and 36:4n-6 in human and rat brain suggests a probable physiological role for this class of fatty acids in these tissues.",

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is associated with elevated levels of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; C(&gt;22:0)) that have been attributed to reduced peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation activity. Previously, our laboratory and others have reported elevated VLCFA levels and reduced peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in human and mouse X-ALD fibroblasts. In this study, we found normal levels of peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in tissues from ALD mice with elevated VLCFA levels. Treatment of ALD mice with pharmacological agents resulted in decreased VLCFA levels without a change in VLCFA beta-oxidation activity. These data indicate that ALDP does not determine the rate of VLCFA beta-oxidation and that VLCFA levels are not determined by the rate of VLCFA beta-oxidation. The rate of peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in human and mouse fibroblasts in vitro is affected by the rate of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. We hypothesize that ALDP facilitates the interaction between peroxisomes and mitochondria, resulting, when ALDP is deficient in X-ALD, in increased VLCFA accumulation despite normal peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in ALD mouse tissues. In support of this hypothesis, mitochondrial structural abnormalities were observed in adrenal cortical cells of ALD mice.",

Acne vulgaris itself is a common chronic skin condition associated with the blockage and/or inflammation of hair follicles and their accompanying sebaceous glands. The acne often presents physically as a mixture of non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesions mainly on the face but on the back and chest as well. Based upon data from Global Burden of Disease studies, the acne vulgaris condition affects up to 85% of young adults aged 12 to 25 years globally - with the possibility of permanent physical and mental scarring resulting from cases of severe acne.  Subsequently, while a number of first line tetracycline therapies like doxycycline and minocycline do exist for treating acne vulgaris, sarecycline presents a new and innovative therapy choice because it exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against relevant pathogens that cause acne vulgaris but also possesses a low propensity for resistance development in such pathogens and a narrower, more specific spectrum of antibacterial activity, resulting in fewer off-target antibacterial effects on endogenous intestinal flora and consequently fewer resultant adverse effects associated with diarrhea, fungal overgrowth, etc.\"]",

The former includes physical and chemical properties from wet-lab experiments recorded in molecule KBs in the form of natural language. The latter includes the chemical bond, molecular ring and aromaticity information, and this helps the spatial structure information reflected in the SMILES expression become more intuitive. Given the chemical SMILES following the task prefixes, our model is trained to generate the natural language answers constructed with the above information.\n\nOur main contributions are as followed: (1) We propose conversational molecular design, an innovative task adopting natural language as the basic medium of human-machine interaction for conducting low-barrier molecular discovery; (2) We provide ChatMol, which is a pre-trained model that can perform well in the new task with the enhancement of molecular knowledge and chemical-natural language associations; (3) Experiment results prove the challenge of the task we propose and also the effectiveness of our method, achieving better performance with much fewer pre-training steps.\n\n\nConversational Molecular Design\n\nIn this section, we clarify the definition and related settings of the newly proposed task.\n\n\nTask Definition\n\nIn each turn of the molecular design, both the human user and the intelligent system may provide molecules expressed in chemical language or chemical properties expressed in natural language. Given the conversation history H(M, T ) which contains molecules M 1,2,...,p and chemical property descriptions T 1,2,...,q , we focus on two main functions that researchers expect the intelligent system to do:\n\n(1) Molecule understanding: The system is required to generate a paragraph of property descriptions T i for the molecule M i in H.\n\n(2) Molecule generation: The system is also supposed to generate a specific molecule M j that meets the requirements in H, which may be text descriptions or the molecules that the target has to be similar with. Since there may be more than one molecule matching the descriptions, the human user can iteratively replenish property descriptions T j+1 , and the system would generate a modified molecule M j+1 according to the current text descriptions T 1,2,...,j+1 and the last-round result M j (with the input as \"it looks like M j \").\n\n\nEvaluation Metrics",

To cope with the training and evaluating demand for conversational molecular design, we create the conversation data based on the molecule-description parallel datasets with the help of manual-designed rule filters.\n\nConversational molecular design is still a challenging task, though PLMs can be used to understand complicated natural-language interactive commands. To be specific, PLMs are proven to be effective when processing natural and chemical languages isolatedly, while conversational design requires a flexible and synergistic comprehension of two kinds of text. Besides, chemical materials are highly specialized and it is not enough for the models to handle molecular design with only commonsense knowledge.\n\nTo achieve the newly proposed task, we design ChatMol, which is a knowledgeable and versatile model based on a generative PLM that can deeply understand and generate natural language (Raffel et al., 2020). To solve the above two challenges, ChatMol is enhanced to first bridge natural and chemical languages smoothly to enable interactive conversation, and then to master plenty of molecular knowledge to better design molecules.\n\nFor bridging different languages, we encourage ChatMol to process natural and chemical languages at the same time, capturing complicated associations between two kinds of text with minimum supervision. We first regard SMILES strings as normal texts and conduct masked language modeling on SMILES and biochemical literature materials separately to gain a basic comprehension of both languages. Further, we train the model to read natural language text, recognize chemical entities, and convert to the chemical language expressions of these entities. To automatically construct the training data, we adopt chemical named entity recognition tools to identify entities in the literature and query their SMILES strings from existing records.",

The production of anti-hapten antibodies of desired specificity largely depends on the hapten design (preserving greatly the chemical structure and spatial conformation of target compound), selection of the appropriate carrier protein and the conjugation method. This manuscript describes a curated database HaptenDB, where information is collected from published literature and web resources.

However, to process the multi-modal conversational molecular design data, it is necessary for our model to capture the associations and convert between the two languages. We apply the following two strategies to construct more mapping data for our model. Molecule Mapping Correlation. We recognize the molecular entities in the literature corpus with the SciSpacy tool (Neumann et al., 2019) and then query for their SMILES from PubChem (Kim et al., 2016). Given the natural language segments, the molecule generation model is required to generate SMILES expressions for all the molecules that appeared in it sequentially. Conversely, the molecule understanding model is expected to generate the standard names of the given molecules. In this way, we help ChatMol build the parallel association with the least supervision.\n\nNotice that the toolkit and KB can also play a role as plugins during the downstream inferencing, we provide the automatically-annotated entity SMILES strings as the prompts given text descriptions for molecule generation. To avoid information leakage, we forcefully remove those SMILES strings in the prompts that are the same as molecules in the answers.\n\nDual Augmentation. Considering that the molecule understanding (molecule-to-text generation) and molecule-to-text generation are a pair of mutual tasks, while existing molecule SMILES strings are much more than molecular property descriptions in natural language, we can take the idea of dual learning Xia et al., 2017), a common mechanism in neural machine translation, to alleviate the challenge of lacking parallel data. Specifically, the fine-tuned molecule understanding model can generate augmented text descriptions for any given molecule, which can feedback on the molecule generation training.\n\n\nInjecting Molecular Knowledge\n\nTo get an in-depth comprehension of the given chemical language expressions and to generate more reasonable and informative natural language descriptions, our model is injected with two types of molecular knowledge.\n\nExperimental Property Knowledge. We expect the model to understand the molecular structures and to master properties explicitly described in the natural language. We collect 15 types of physical and chemical properties determined experimentally from PubChem database (Kim et al., 2016), including solubility, color, corrosivity and so on. These properties can be directly described in natural language and provide supervision signals for molecule understanding.",

Recent studies suggest that one of the efficient ways to produce novel molecules matching target properties is to model SMILES sequences using deep learning in a way similar to language modeling in natural language processing. In this paper, we present a survey of various machine learning methods for SMILES-based language modeling and propose our benchmarking results on a standardized subset of ChEMBL database.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn de novo molecular design, we seek to produce novel molecule libraries that meet required property profiles. Our aim is to create generative statistical models for molecular data that can capture the distributions of molecular compounds and generate a new set of valid compounds with the desired property requirements. Some notable advances in complete de novo drug design are established by Segler et al. [1] and Gupta et al. [2]; they introduce generative recurrent networks, which are trained on a large and diverse data set to recognize general features of molecules and fine-tuned on a smaller focused set active towards the desired target. Brown et al. [3] and Polykovsky et al. [4] attempt to compose standardized benchmarking frameworks with various generative models as well as distribution and property-based evaluation metrics.\n\nThe choice of a particular generative model depends on several aspects of the given task and materials. Considering data, the most common representation of a molecule is simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notation [5], which comprises ASCII characters structured by a special language rule. This specification immediately suggests the possibility of building SMILES-based language models, in which a SMILES character can be treated as a single token, a sequence of one or more tokens as a (meaningful) text or phrase, and the whole text data set as a language corpus. Inspired by such natural language models as n-grams and recurrent neural networks [6], we are free to simulate our own language framework capable of capturing SMILES fragments and generating novel sequences.",

We then focused on scientific literatures, seeing that literatures of natural product-deriving researches invariably report biological species from which they extract the natural molecules. As a strategy of screening literatures for data sources, our data analysts browse the contents of each journal by issues and volumes, select the required articles based on rough judgments of the titles and abstracts and obtain the full text PDF version of the articles, or abstract texts and bibliographic information when the PDF file is unavailable. The collected literatures would be screened again by inspecting the main body of the articles before extracting data from them, to exclude literatures that have no descriptions of natural products and biological sources. We involved the major publications of natural product-deriving researches both domestic (Chinese) and international (English), 45% of them are extensive research on natural products, others are on phytochemistry, traditional Chinese medicine, food industry and miscellaneous, as shown in Figure 1. Classification of a selected journal is based on the scope description of the journal. The main list of publications that NPBS database covered is provided as Supplemental data.\n\nIn the early stage of this project, we collected the raw data of NPBS database from publications manually. Our data analysts reviewed the literatures and indexed the information of biological sources and the molecules of natural products. With the practical experience and plenty of hand-curated data, we developed a text-mining system (NPBSsys) for computer-aided data acquisition and attempted to extract the required data information from the textual description of the journal literatures automatically ( Figure 2). The NPBSsys used the technology of named entity recognition (NER); more specifically, a methodology of NER based on rules and dictionaries was implemented in this system (17). The biological information of the species names and parts was matched by dictionaries we built, for example, 'Salvia kiaometiensis' and 'roots' in the sentence of 'study the chemical constituents of the roots of Salvia kiaometiensis'. The chemical names of natural products were matched by rule templates we designed, for example, 'euscaphic acid' and 'hyptadienic acid' in the sentence of 'two compounds were obtained and identified as euscaphic acid and hyptadienic acid'.",

These features may be attributed to the rich stereochemistry of natural product structures. Furthermore, exploring molecules with \"beyond-rule-of-5\" properties, common in natural products, has been considered a potential avenue for drug discovery. Therefore, natural products provide potential opportunities for modern drug discovery, including improving binding specificity and clinical trial progression [2].\n\nDefining and exploring chemical spaces is essential for facilitating the process of molecular discovery and can be operationalized through algorithmic approaches and machine learning. Chemical space refers to the complete collection of all conceivable molecules or materials, with subspaces that are more restricted in scope because of the structures or functions of the molecules they comprise [3]. The chemical space of natural products contains many different chemotypes, including lipids, alkaloids, sugars, flavonoids, polyketides, oxosteroids, coumarins, psoralenes, steroidal or cardiac glycosides and oligopeptides [1].\n\nThe importance of chemical space lies not only in its size but also in its diversity. This is especially true when the space contains molecules that meet the design objectives for various discovery tasks [4]. To achieve a diverse chemical space, it is important to select building blocks with unique or intriguing structural motifs. Simply relying on typical chemical processes may not produce enough compounds to adequately test. By prioritizing diversity, scientists tend to increase the likelihood of discovering effective molecules that can fulfill various discovery objectives.\n\nPharmaceuticals contain chemical and biological aspects. Biological target space refers to all possible biological targets a drug could interact with [5]. There is a close relationship between chemical and biological target spaces, as chemical structures must be designed and optimized to interact with specific biological targets to achieve desired therapeutic effects. In drug discovery, scientists have created various computational methods to effectively and logically explore chemical space such as molecular generation [6] and chemical similarity metrics [7]. Similarly, target-based and virtual screening methods can help identify potential biological targets for a given chemical compound or library, such as a natural product library. Thus, integrating and exploring chemical and target spaces through computational methods can expedite the discovery of promising drug candidates.",

In order to convert the atom from sp3 to sp2, a carbocation, carbanion, or carbon radical must be formed. These leave sp2-hybridized carbons that can partake in the \u03c0 system of an aromatic molecule. Like neutral aromatic compounds, these compounds are stable and form easily. The cyclopentadienyl anion is formed very easily and thus 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a very acidic hydrocarbon with a pKa of 16.

While this specification allowed for facile annotation of bonds with properties and descriptors, it resulted in significant search performance hits, forcing us to reconsider elements of our specification. As a result, we have created a test set where, apart from specifying explicit bonds, we also linked bonded atom instances with the appropriate bidirectional relationships that corresponded to bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic). This improved performance considerably and allowed us to carry out our tests. Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2). It must be noted that answering this query in a typical SPARQL engine involves the exhaustive examination of all the candidate molecules that may potentially contain a collection of atoms that satisfy the laid out bonding criteria. Unfortunately, since the SPARQL query engines currently available have not been explicitly optimized chemical searching needs, they often lack many of the mechanisms developed over the past decades to accelerate the solution of this problem, and resemble the brute force approach to graph matching more closely.\n\nAppendix 2. An automatically generated (based on graphical user input) SPARQL query to identify all molecules containing an ethyl subgraph, altered for improved readability. Note the use of 'has single bond with' direct atom relationship to improve query performance.\n\nprefix Description logic-safe rules may be used to reason about instances of an OWL-DL ontology where the description follows a graph-like pattern instead of the general 'tree-like' expression. In this way, one can combine classical DL-reasoning with graph-like descriptions to classify molecules as more specific kinds of compounds, provided that they satisfy certain sub-graph conditions. For instance, an ethyl compound would be a kind of a molecule that contains an ethyl group with two carbon atoms linked together by a single bond.",

The complexes of ligand molecules with such nanocarriers were characterized by much lower values of binding affinity than those created by CNT. This phenomenon can be largely explained by the size of the considered nanoparticles and the geometry of the molecules determining the exposure of the fullerene aromatic systems. The analyzed functionalized fullerenes clearly demonstrated the group of potential modifications that exhibit significant potential in increasing of binding capacity of C 60 molecule. The addition of a single aromatic system on the surface of the fullerene considerably increased binding affinity toward the ligand molecule, relative to native fullerene. The addition of multiple aromatic systems contributed to the achievement of even better binding abilities of the considered nanosystems. Another class of modifications were substituents containing hydrogen bond donors and acceptors; however, the observed effects were less satisfactory, which was due to lower affinity values relative to nanostructures with aromatic substituents and the lack of any conformation of ligands that ensured the formation of hydrogen bonds. Such observations clearly confirm that in the case of this particular ligand molecule, the most important interactions are stacking interactions between aromatic moieties.\n\nThe last group of considered nanosytems, namely cube rhombellane homeomorphs, showed the lowest binding capacity relative to the ligand molecule. A large group of proposed compounds exhibited satisfying binding affinity towards the ligand molecule. The binding capacity of these nanostructures is strictly related with the structure of the external shell of these molecules.

The vicinal adjective is sometimes restricted to those molecules with two identical functional groups. The use of the term can also be extended to substituents on aromatic rings. 1H NMR spectroscopy In 1H NMR spectroscopy, the coupling of two hydrogen atoms on adjacent carbon atoms is called vicinal coupling. The vicinal coupling constant is referred to as 3J because the hydrogen atoms couple through three bonds. Depending on the other substituents, the vicinal coupling constant assumes values between 0 and +20 Hz. The dependence of the vicinal coupling constant on the dihedral angle is described by the Karplus relation.

The IUPAC criteria for antiaromaticity are as follows: The molecule must be cyclic. The molecule must be planar. The molecule must have a complete conjugated \u03c0-electron system within the ring. The molecule must have 4n \u03c0-electrons where n is any integer within the conjugated \u03c0-system. This differs from aromaticity only in the fourth criterion: aromatic molecules have 4n +2 \u03c0-electrons in the conjugated \u03c0 system and therefore follow H\u00fcckel\u2019s rule.

As a result, the IUPAC nomenclature of phenol ethers will often take the form of \u201calkoxybenzene\u201d or \u201cphenoxyalkane,\u201d where the alkane is some sort of hydrocarbon substituent. The preference of the benzene ring in nomenclature relies on whether the alkane has more or less carbons than the benzene ring itself. Anisole is formally known as methoxybenzene, and is formed through the condensation of methanol (CH3OH) and phenol; due to the methyl group attached to the ethereal oxygen being smaller than the aromatic benzene ring, the benzene takes priority when naming the molecule. However, 1-phenoxyoctane has an octane substituent, which has a greater number of carbons than a benzene ring.",

Towards Alignment with Structural DiversityIn this experiment, we show that our method enables LLMs to better generate diverse molecules compared to the existing decoding schemes for diverse sequence generation.To validate the consistent improvement, we implement our fine-tuning method and decoding schemes on two models specialized in the chemical domain: BioT5 + (Pei et al., 2024) and MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022).\n\nTasks.We consider description-guided molecule generation using the ChEBI-20 dataset, which includes training and test sets (Edwards et al., 2021).Note that the training dataset has also been used to pre-train the base LLMs, BioT5 + and MolT5, i.e., not an external dataset.The test dataset is unobserved during both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases.Each data point consists of a pair of a description and a ground-truth example molecule that satisfies the description.\n\nIn our experiments, we consider generating 50 molecules for each description in the ChEBI-20 test dataset involving 3300 molecular descriptions.We then evaluate both the structural diversity of the generated molecules and how well they satisfy the given descriptions.13.The Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm (Fruchterman & Reingold, 1991) embeds each molecule in a 2-dimensional space based on Tanimoto similarity.Here, a low distance yields a high Tanimoto similarity.Each dot, shaded circle, and edge represent accepted molecules, distinct clusters (used to measure NCircles), and a pair with similarity above 0.65, respectively.Our method better captures the molecular diversity.\n\nMetrics.To measure the similarity between two molecules, we use Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015), which based on distance of molecular structures from fingerprints.To be specific, we consider the following metrics for generated molecules:\n\n\u2022 The number of accepted and unique molecules (Accepted & unique): This metric measures the number of valid and unique molecules satisfying the given description.3\n\n\u2022 The number of circles (NCircles; Xie et al., 2023): This metric considers both the quality and diversity of generated molecules.For the accepted molecules satisfying the given description, this metric counts the number of maximum distinct clusters with Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015) below a threshold h, i.e., indicating chemical space coverage (illustrated in Figure 6).",

The molecule cannot be represented by one structure, but rather a resonance hybrid of different structures, such as with the two resonance structures of benzene.

While this specification allowed for facile annotation of bonds with properties and descriptors, it resulted in significant search performance hits, forcing us to reconsider elements of our specification. As a result, we have created a test set where, apart from specifying explicit bonds, we also linked bonded atom instances with the appropriate bidirectional relationships that corresponded to bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic). This improved performance considerably and allowed us to carry out our tests. Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2).

An alternative approach to the problem, taking into account the inertial properties of the nematic molecules, allows one to satisfy the initial boundary conditions on the first-order time derivative of the tilt angle. In this framework the dynamical evolution of the nematic deformation, in the initial time, depends on the inertial properties of the nematic molecules. However, the typical relaxation time is so short that, for all practical effects, the first time derivative of the tilt angle is discontinuous at t=0 . A more realistic description involves the switching time of the distorting field. In this framework, the initial boundary condition of the first-order derivative is automatically satisfied.

Given the importance of molecular shape in the description of spatial interactions in crystals or ligand-target complexes, this is not a satisfying state. In the current work, we propose a novel application of alpha shapes to the description of the shapes of small molecules. Alpha shapes are parametrized generalizations of the convex hull. For a specific value of alpha, the alpha shape is the geometric dual of the space-filling model of a molecule, with the parameter alpha allowing description of shape in varying degrees of detail. To date, alpha shapes have been used to find macromolecular cavities and to estimate molecular surface areas and volumes. We developed a novel methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. In this work, we show that alpha-shape descriptors reveal aspects of molecular shape that are complementary to other shape descriptors and that accord well with chemists' intuition about shape. While our implementation of alpha-shape descriptors is not computationally trivial, we suggest that the additional shape characteristics they provide can be used to improve and complement shape-analysis methods in domains such as crystallography and ligand-target interactions. In this communication, we present a unique methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape.

We demonstrate that, as a result of the anisotropy of the impinging projectile, initial rotational excitation leads to an increase in intensity of high-order diffraction peaks at incidence directions that satisfy precise symmetry constraints, thus providing a more detailed information on the surface characteristics than that obtained from low-order atomic diffraction peaks under fast grazing incidence conditions. As quadrupole-ion surface potentials are expected to accurately represent the interaction between H<sub2</sub and any surface with a marked ionic character, our analysis should be of general applicability to any of such surfaces. Finally, we show that a density functional theory description of the molecule-ion surface potential catches the main features observed experimentally.",

This method, however, often becomes computationally inefficient due to the large amount of sampling needed for accurate statistics. iNA provides a more efficient way to obtain the desired statistics via the system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation, a systematic analytical approximation method.

However, such models expect a molecular description of the feedstocks, of the reaction pathways, and of the rate equations and rate parameters. In what follows, methods to determine a molecular-level description of the feedstock are first discussed in detail and illustrated. Subsequently, the simulation of detailed reaction networks is discussed by simultaneously treating the generation and reduction of the detailed reaction networks, and the rate equations, rate parameters and reactor simulation, before illustrating examples of various applications.\n\n\nMolecular Description of the Feedstocks\n\nThe first step in the simulation of a detailed molecule-based kinetic model is to determine the molecular-level description of the feedstock. This step is a crucial component of the molecule-based kinetic modeling since the feedstock description provides the major part of the 'initial conditions' of a molecular reaction model. The molecular description can be obtained either by using, when possible, advanced analytical characterization techniques, or by numerically creating a molecular representation of the feedstock through composition modeling algorithms, here called molecular reconstruction methods.\n\nIn this section, the existing methods of obtaining the molecular description of the feedstock will be reviewed.\n\n\nAnalytical Characterization",

Given the conversation history H(M, T ) which contains molecules M 1,2,...,p and chemical property descriptions T 1,2,...,q , we focus on two main functions that researchers expect the intelligent system to do:\n\n(1) Molecule understanding: The system is required to generate a paragraph of property descriptions T i for the molecule M i in H.\n\n(2) Molecule generation: The system is also supposed to generate a specific molecule M j that meets the requirements in H, which may be text descriptions or the molecules that the target has to be similar with. Since there may be more than one molecule matching the descriptions, the human user can iteratively replenish property descriptions T j+1 , and the system would generate a modified molecule M j+1 according to the current text descriptions T 1,2,...,j+1 and the last-round result M j (with the input as \"it looks like M j \").\n\n\nEvaluation Metrics",

Such a large (ideally exhaustive) collection of polymers would be particularly powerful in conjunction with machine learning and numerical simulation techniques, as a way to facilitate complicated tasks like human-guided molecular exploration [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] , property prediction [13][14][15][16][17] , and retro-synthesis [18,19] . Computational approaches based on chemical representations and generated data [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] have also tremendously reduced the time, cost, and resources spent on physical synthesis in the chemistry lab [28][29][30][31] .\n\nIdeally, a chemical design model would include three components: (1) a well-defined representation capable of capturing known structures, (2) a generative model capable of enumerating all structures in a given class, and (3) an inverse modeling procedure capable of translating known molecular structures into the representation. For a given class of molecules, an ideal chemical design model should satisfy the following five criteria: i. Complete: representation is able to encode all possible structures in the given class. ii. Explicit: representation directly specifies the molecular structure. iii. Valid: every generated output is a physically valid chemical structure in the given class. iv. Explainable: the generation process is understandable to the user. v. Invertible: the inverse procedure can translate molecular structures into the given representation. However, designing a chemical model that meets all these criteria is challenging, especially for structurally complex molecules. Most existing approaches are limited to small, simple chemical structures [32][33][34][35][36] . Even with this limited scope, the design is labor intensive: the representation language is typically developed first, then extended for generation and inverse modeling. In particular, there have been many systems for molecular line notations [32,33] and fragment-level description [34,35] , which were then used as the basis for generative and inverse schemes [5][6][7][8] .",

Each study was assessed based on the following parameters: (I) description of sample size, (II) presence of a control group, (III) blinded assessment of the experimental outcome, (IV) adequately addressing outcome data, (V) standardized sample preparation, and (VI) inclusion of a conflict-of-interest statement. A score of 0 was assigned to a criterion for a study if it was clearly reported, a score of 1 was assigned to a criterion if it was vague or insufficiently reported, and a score of 2 was assigned to a criterion if the information was not present. The six criterion scores for each study were then summed to obtain a cumulative score. Articles that were at low risk of bias scored between 0-3, moderate risk of bias scored between 4-8, and high risk of bias scored between 9-12. Finally, any disagreements between the two authors during the evaluation were later discussed and a consensus was reached.\n\n\nInter-Rater Reliability (IRR)\n\nAn inter-rater reliability (IRR) test for the risk of bias assessment was performed using a kappa calculator on SPSS Statistics (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) following the procedure outlined by McHugh [94].

This concept of an orbital is only meaningful under the approximation that if we ignore the electron-electron instantaneous repulsion terms in the Hamiltonian as a simplifying assumption, we can decompose the total eigenvector of a many-electron molecule into separate contributions from individual electron stationary states (orbitals), each of which are obtained under the one-electron approximation.

Thus, three different prototype shapes for the respective Lewis acid and Lewis base were considered, leading to \ue103ve designs for the correction volume V corr (Fig. 8, for a mathematical description see the ESI \u2020). Prototype I comprises cone-shaped molecules, BMe 3 as an example for a Lewis acid and PMe 3 as an example for a Lewis base. When two prototype I molecules are combined into a Lewis acid/base pair, V corr is approximated using the volume of a segment V seg of sphere S (design 1). Prototype II con\ue104ates fan-like and more bulky molecules such as NHCs or PF 5 . For the combination of two prototype II molecules V corr is approximated using the volume of a biconvex lens V bcl (design 2). Design 3 is suitable for the combination of a prototype I molecule and a prototype II molecule, e.g. BMe 3 and a NHC, with V corr being a convex lens V cl (design 3). Prototype III molecules are sterically overcrowded and thus have a % V Bur of more than 50%. Examination of a combination of a prototype I and a prototype III molecule leads to an approximation of V corr as a half-segment V hseg (design 4). For the pair of a prototype II and a prototype III molecule, the volume of a half-biconvex lens V hbcl (design 5) should be applied as correction volume (Fig. 8). To take into account that prototype III molecules extend into the hemisphere of the potential adduct partner when their %V bur exceeds 50%, an empirical correction was introduced for the correction volumes V corr of design 4 V hseg and design 5 V hbcl (for details including the mathematical description of the \ue103ve designs see the ESI \u2020). The distance h between the different types of correction volumes was estimated to be d/2 (Fig. 8). This estimation gives very accurate results, as outlined below. In principle, the combination of a prototype III Lewis base with a prototype III Lewis acid is possible. However, a combination of two molecules with %V Bur of more than 50% usually results in a repulsive, and thus nonbonding interaction.",

This is because molecular bonds (and therefore the interatomic distance ) are not completely fixed; the bond between the atoms stretches out as the molecule rotates faster (higher values of the rotational quantum number ). This effect can be accounted for by introducing a correction factor known as the centrifugal distortion constant (bars on top of various quantities indicate that these quantities are expressed in cm\u22121): where is the fundamental vibrational frequency of the bond (in cm\u22121). This frequency is related to the reduced mass and the force constant (bond strength) of the molecule according to",

Loxoribine undergoes facilitated transport across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell and acts intracellularly, bypassing the biochemical steps involved in the membrane signal transduction pathway used by Ag or anti-IgM Abs to activate B cells. This agent activates the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a member of the TLR family of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors thereby activating the innate immune system. This activation requires endosomal maturation and recognition is restricted to TLR7. As a result, loxoribine induces cycling B cells to proliferate and differentiate non-specifically and recruit antigen-reactive B cells to undergo differentiation to antibody production, markedly amplifying the underlying response in the process.']",

Given this rise in anesthetic procedures being performed, delivering anesthesia in a safe manner becomes of utmost importance. Patients being cared for by anesthesiologists can be exposed to oxidative stress preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively [10]. Given the fact that the anesthesiologist cares for patients during all three of these phases, he or she has the potential to influence the extent to which the individual patient might be exposed to oxidative stress. However, perioperative oxidative stress is a complex response that comprises also patient and surgical factors. Nonetheless, anesthesiologists are in a unique position to convey countermeasures to oxidative stress and potentially improve the postoperative outcome. As such, a better understanding of the impact anesthetic agents play on oxidative stress and the clinical consequences is urgently needed so as to potentially improve patients' outcomes.\n\n\nOxidative Stress and Postoperative Outcome\n\nThe influence of preoperative risk factors and preoperative levels of oxidative stress is imperative in determining the degree of elevation of intraoperative oxidative stress. Additionally, the magnitude of the surgical intervention is a major determinant of intraoperative oxidative stress, with more invasive techniques being associated with increased oxidative stress levels compared with minimally invasive procedures [11]. Furthermore, oxidative stress has been shown to play an important role during different steps of many surgical procedures, such as transplantation (heart, liver, etc.), clamping/unclamping of the aorta (thoracic surgery and abdominal aortic surgery), intermittent inflow occlusion (hepatic and cardiac surgery), and release of a limb tourniquet (orthopedic surgery) [10]. Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a critical condition that often appears in more complex surgeries, with oxidative stress playing a major role in eliciting signaling pathways that lead to the onset of necrosis/apoptosis. During the reoxygenation phase, ROS inflict direct tissue damage and initiate a cascade of deleterious cellular responses which culminate in inflammation and cell death [10].",

The compound looked promising and passed initial screening in which rodents were given opioids along with charcoal meals to track GI transit, and were tested for analgesia.

The entire right humerus and proximal third of the left humerus were clipped www.advancedscience.com and aseptically prepared for surgery. For analgesia, a brachial plexus nerve block was performed preoperatively using 20 mg of levobupivacaine, and methadone (6 mg IV) was given once during surgery. A standard surgical approach was made to the fractured humerus, on its medial aspect. Approximately 1 cm of the nonhealing ends of the bone were excised, along with all soft tissue within the fracture gap. The fracture was stabilized using a 3.5 mm locking compression plate (Synthes) placed medially and a 2.7-mm locking compression plate (Synthes) placed cranio-medially. A standard surgical approach was made over the greater trochanter of the left humerus and a hole was drilled in the lateral cortex using a 4.5 mm drill bit. A curette was used to harvest cancellous bone from the humeral head, which was then mixed with 5 cc of pPEA-chips (decellularized bone chips coated with pPEA using plasma polymerization and subsequently with FN and BMP-2, as previously described).

For instance, younger patients have a higher oxygen consumption rate than adults requiring a higher respiratory rate. Since anesthetic drugs depress respiration, kittens and puppies must be monitored for hypoventilation. By using recommended drugs and procedures, anesthetic and surgical risks can be reduced.

In this single-center, randomized, double-blind, and double-dummy trial, we aimed to test whether the analgesic effect of adding preoperative pregabalin, at a dose unlikely to induce side effects, to preoperative dexamethasone improves early mobilization after spinal surgery. A total of 160 patients undergoing scheduled lumbar disk surgery (145 analyzed) comprised the study cohort. The patients received either 0.2\u2009mg/kg intravenous dexamethasone before incision, or 150\u2009mg oral pregabalin 1 hour before surgery, or a combination of the 2, or none of the above (control). Analgesia was supplemented by acetaminophen and ketoprofen, plus oxycodone ad libitum. The primary outcome was pain intensity during the first attempt to sit up, assessed the morning of the first postoperative day on an 11-point Numerical Rating Scale. Pain at rest and when standing up, opioid consumption, and tolerance were also assessed. None of the treatments tested differed from the control group in terms of efficacy or tolerance, even 6 months after surgery. The overall quality of analgesia was good, with only 10% and 30% of pain scores exceeding 3/10 for pain at rest and during movement, respectively.

A serious clinical problem that can occur because of surgery is the condition of persistent postsurgical pain (PPP). This has been defined as pain that lasts longer than three months after surgery. The incidence of PPP has been reported to be as high as 40%, with greater than 18% of patients reporting their pain as moderate to severe. 1 The physiological consequences of inadequately controlled post-operative pain can result in various complications (i.e., respiratory, cardiovascular, thromboembolic, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and psychological), all of which can delay or impair patient recovery and increase the total cost of care. Inadequate post-operative pain control may also lead to the development of chronic pain after surgery. These problems highlight the overarching goal of post-operative pain management, which is to avoid post-operative complications and the development of chronic pain, thereby improving the comfort of the patient, facilitating recovery, reducing morbidity and promoting quicker discharge from the hospital. 2\n\n\nPre-emptive analgesia\n\nPre-emptive or preventive analgesia is defined \"as the administration of analgesia before surgical incision to prevent establishment of central sensitization from incision or inflammatory injury in order to achieve optimal post-operative pain control.\" The results of clinical trials on the efficacy of pre-emptive analgesia are controversial due to the difficulty in differences in noxious stimuli intensity, verification of the direct pharmacological effect of treatment, differences in drug concentrations between study groups, and outcome measurements. 3\n\n\nGlutaminase in primary sensory neurons",

To compensate for blood and fluid loss 5 ml of Ringers Acetate were injected subcutaneously. Skin of the jaw was disinfected with alcoholic iodine prior to surgery. The skin was incised longitudinally along the posterior edge of the mandible. The masseteric muscle was released subperiosteally from the edge of the bone and masseteric fossa exposed. A hole was drilled into the central part of the masseteric fossa with a 4-mm dental drill (Fig. 1A). Thereafter, bone debris was thoroughly rinsed from the drilled area by flushing with 5 ml sterile saline water. In the first experiment, the void was filled with 40 ml of the IP formulation using a syringe without an attached needle ( Fig. 1B and C) or left untreated (control). In the second experiment the IP volume was decreased to 25 ml because 40 ml proved to be excessive as IP material tended to smear out around the drillhole. The surgical wound was closed with 4-0 polyglactin running s.c. suture and the skin with 4-0 polyamide nonabsorbable running suture. Blood loss was estimated by weighing the dental rolls used for soaking up blood during surgery. For post-operative analgesia, either Butorphanol 2 mg/kg or Buprenorphine 0.05 mg/kg, was given no later than 4 h after induction of anesthesia, or as soon as the animal started moving post-operatively.

The absence of distinctive symptoms and lack of effective and available screening approaches in clinical practice makes early diagnosis of OC difficult. Unfortunately, stage of diagnosis is a major factor that determinates the survival rate of OC patients, and the average 5-year survival rate for OC patients is only 44% [3,4]. Although chemotherapy in advanced OC can achieve similar therapeutic efficiency as surgery, radical resection remains the primary treatment approach for OC [5,6]. Noticeably, anesthetic drugs must be properly used during OC surgery to avoid adverse effects of anesthesia, such as respiratory depression and unstable vital signs [7]. Therefore, selection of anesthetic drugs essential for OC radical surgery.\n\nDexmedetomidine (DMED) is a selective a 2 -adrenoreceptor agonist that is a novel adjuvant analgesic-sparing agent used for reducing stress and protecting the cardiovascular system [8].

Following cesarean section births, use of DMED can increase the analgesia effect from local anesthetics and can decrease adverse reactions [10]. In an OC rat model, DMED was found to inhibit activation of chemotherapy resistance pathways, thus improving therapeutic efficiency in patients with OC [11].",

While biosynthetic pathway towards DA from geranyl diphosphate and L-glutamate has been previously proposed, its late stage is still unclear. Here, six novel DA related compounds, 7'-methyl-isodomoic acid A (2) and B (3), N-geranyl-L-glutamic acid (4), 7'-hydroxymethyl-isodomoic acid A (5) and B (6), and N-geranyl-3(R)-hydroxy-L-glutamic acid (7), were isolated from the red alga, Chondria armata, and their structures were determined. The compounds 4 and 7, linear compounds, are predictable as the precursors to form the DA pyrrolidine ring. The compounds 2 and 3 are thought as the cyclized products of 7; therefore, dehydration and electron transfer from the internal olefin of 7 is a possible mechanism for the pyrrolidine ring formation. One terminal methyl group of the side chain of 2 and 3 is predicted to be oxidized to hydroxymethyl (5, 6), and then to carboxylic acids, forming isodomoic acids A and B. Finally, the terminal olefin of isodomoic acid A would be isomerized to form DA. In addition, [<sup15</supN, D]-labeled 4 was incorporated into DA using the diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries, demonstrating that 4 is the genuine precursor of DA.",

Type I and II 5\u03b1-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. Dutasteride was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as monotherapy or in combination with the \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist [tamsulosin] to enhance the therapeutic response. Its clinical efficacy against benign prostate hyperplasia in male patients is comparable to that of [finasteride], a specific type II 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.']",

Its conjugate base and anion is 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). In solution, P5C is in spontaneous equilibrium with glutamate-5-semialdhyde (GSA). The stereoisomer (S)-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (also referred to as L-P5C) is an intermediate metabolite in the biosynthesis and degradation of proline and arginine. In prokaryotic proline biosynthesis, GSA is synthesized from \u03b3-glutamyl phosphate by the enzyme \u03b3-glutamyl phosphate reductase. In most eukaryotes, GSA is synthesised from the amino acid glutamate by the bifunctional enzyme 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase(P5CS). The human P5CS is encoded by the ALDH18A1 gene.

This DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over. This characteristic of biological molecules could make their production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive. Whereas electronic computers require manual production, biocomputers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them.",

In SMILES aromaticity is considered to be a property of both atoms and bonds whereas in SLN it is a property of bonds. Description Like SMILES, SLN is a linear language that describes molecules. This provides a lot of similarity with SMILES despite SLN's many differences from SMILES, and as a result this description will heavily compare SLN to SMILES and its extensions.",

The latter case is therefore the more characteristic electronic nature of the two.

In contrast, in anthracene the resonance structures have one sextet each, which can be at any of the three rings, and the aromaticity spreads out more evenly across the whole molecule. This difference in number of sextets is reflected in the differing ultraviolet\u2013visible spectra of these two isomers, as higher Clar pi-sextets are associated with larger HOMO-LUMO gaps; the highest-wavelength absorbance of phenanthrene is at 293 nm, while anthracene is at 374 nm.

Classes of molecules often have a characteristic fragment ion that can be used to search for those molecules in a total ion current. This is known as a selected ion chromatogram (SIC).

In general, aromatic molecules contain planar carbon-based cyclic ring systems. In addition, aromatic molecules also possess enhanced stability due to electron delocalization.

Robinson discovered that the main group metal gallium, if properly constrained, could exhibit aromatic behavior. Robinson's group prepared a compound that contained a three-membered ring of gallium atoms in a dianion, [R3Ga3]2- (R = large organic ligand). This [R3Ga3]2- dianion was found to be isoelectronic with the aromatic triphenylcyclopropenium cation, [Ph3C3]+.

So, it was decided to increase the efficacy of this molecule creating other ones that could be more powerful. Among these 600 created molecules, there was the VIR-576 which was synthesized using the solid-phase peptide synthesis method. Moreover, another molecule was used to protect the amino groups, the fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride. The next step was the purification before lyophilizing it with mannitol.

While this specification allowed for facile annotation of bonds with properties and descriptors, it resulted in significant search performance hits, forcing us to reconsider elements of our specification. As a result, we have created a test set where, apart from specifying explicit bonds, we also linked bonded atom instances with the appropriate bidirectional relationships that corresponded to bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic). This improved performance considerably and allowed us to carry out our tests. Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2). It must be noted that answering this query in a typical SPARQL engine involves the exhaustive examination of all the candidate molecules that may potentially contain a collection of atoms that satisfy the laid out bonding criteria. Unfortunately, since the SPARQL query engines currently available have not been explicitly optimized chemical searching needs, they often lack many of the mechanisms developed over the past decades to accelerate the solution of this problem, and resemble the brute force approach to graph matching more closely.\n\nAppendix 2.

Biochemical reactions with their relative constants from the previous model [21] were updated, when possible, using data from literature and the BioNumbers [30] database. The transcription reactions were modeled using data from published material [31]; the translational core model was updated using a more detailed kinetic description [32].\n\n\nIn silico PURESYSTEM model\n\nThe first result obtained in this work has been a detailed formal description of the PS: every molecular component was explicitly inserted in the model together with the known biochemical reactions between the different reagents, as described in the previous section.\n\nThe same model simplifications present in the previous work [21] were introduced to create a suitable transcription/translation formulation.\n\nHowever, as pointed in the previous section, a formal description of interdependent elongation events transcends the standard SSA specifications, which depicts the system evolution according to propensities rules only proportional to the number of reacting molecules, without accounting for the presence of sequential processes or topological constraints (Figure 7).\n\nTo coherently describe the proper distance between elongating molecules and, subsequently, a correct occupancy of RNA and DNA sequences, all the species involved in the elongation events (DNA, RNA, polymerases and ribosomes) were split into multiple entities representing different molecular states (Figure 8).\n\nThe divisions in multiple molecular states allows a coherent organization of site occupancies and dynamic motion, but the transition events describing the forward motion of ribosomes and polymerases are two processes which act in a sequential fashion.",

While this specification allowed for facile annotation of bonds with properties and descriptors, it resulted in significant search performance hits, forcing us to reconsider elements of our specification. As a result, we have created a test set where, apart from specifying explicit bonds, we also linked bonded atom instances with the appropriate bidirectional relationships that corresponded to bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic). This improved performance considerably and allowed us to carry out our tests. Herein we find another demonstration of the versatility of semantically enabled information representations: we have been able to extend and amend the information in our knowledge repository without much additional effort or adverse effects on the knowledge repository. So long as our specification is consistent with the formal axioms underpinning the concepts in a supporting ontology, there is no barrier preventing us from extending our specification indefinitely.\n\nOne may search for molecules containing a particular sub-graph using the explicit specification of the structure of the sought molecular sub-graph as a SPARQL query (Appendix 2). It must be noted that answering this query in a typical SPARQL engine involves the exhaustive examination of all the candidate molecules that may potentially contain a collection of atoms that satisfy the laid out bonding criteria. Unfortunately, since the SPARQL query engines currently available have not been explicitly optimized chemical searching needs, they often lack many of the mechanisms developed over the past decades to accelerate the solution of this problem, and resemble the brute force approach to graph matching more closely.\n\nAppendix 2.

An alternative approach to the problem, taking into account the inertial properties of the nematic molecules, allows one to satisfy the initial boundary conditions on the first-order time derivative of the tilt angle. In this framework the dynamical evolution of the nematic deformation, in the initial time, depends on the inertial properties of the nematic molecules. However, the typical relaxation time is so short that, for all practical effects, the first time derivative of the tilt angle is discontinuous at t=0 . A more realistic description involves the switching time of the distorting field. In this framework, the initial boundary condition of the first-order derivative is automatically satisfied.

Given the importance of molecular shape in the description of spatial interactions in crystals or ligand-target complexes, this is not a satisfying state. In the current work, we propose a novel application of alpha shapes to the description of the shapes of small molecules. Alpha shapes are parametrized generalizations of the convex hull. For a specific value of alpha, the alpha shape is the geometric dual of the space-filling model of a molecule, with the parameter alpha allowing description of shape in varying degrees of detail. To date, alpha shapes have been used to find macromolecular cavities and to estimate molecular surface areas and volumes. We developed a novel methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. In this work, we show that alpha-shape descriptors reveal aspects of molecular shape that are complementary to other shape descriptors and that accord well with chemists' intuition about shape. While our implementation of alpha-shape descriptors is not computationally trivial, we suggest that the additional shape characteristics they provide can be used to improve and complement shape-analysis methods in domains such as crystallography and ligand-target interactions. In this communication, we present a unique methodology for computing molecular shape characteristics from the alpha shape. We first describe details of the alpha-shape calculation, an outline of validation experiments performed, and a discussion of the advantages and challenges we found while implementing this approach. The results show that, relative to known shape calculations, this method provides a high degree of shape resolution with even small changes in atomic coordinates.",

From six-dimensional solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we show that diffraction of H<sub2</sub molecules under fast grazing incidence conditions could be even more informative for the characterization of ionic surfaces, due to the large anisotropic electrostatic interaction between the quadrupole moment of the molecule and the electric field created by the ionic crystal. Using the LiF(001) surface as a benchmark, we show that fast grazing incidence diffraction of H<sub2</sub strongly depends on the initial rotational state of the molecule, while rotationally inelastic processes are irrelevant. We demonstrate that, as a result of the anisotropy of the impinging projectile, initial rotational excitation leads to an increase in intensity of high-order diffraction peaks at incidence directions that satisfy precise symmetry constraints, thus providing a more detailed information on the surface characteristics than that obtained from low-order atomic diffraction peaks under fast grazing incidence conditions. As quadrupole-ion surface potentials are expected to accurately represent the interaction between H<sub2</sub and any surface with a marked ionic character, our analysis should be of general applicability to any of such surfaces.

Theories using many-body coupled-cluster methods are based on the evaluation of derivatives of energy with respect to external fields in an analytic manner. Extensive development of these theories were carried by him for molecules, with closed shell configurations. The codes developed by him have a potential use in the description of non-linear molecular materials, with possible applications in electronic devices.",

The complexes of ligand molecules with such nanocarriers were characterized by much lower values of binding affinity than those created by CNT. This phenomenon can be largely explained by the size of the considered nanoparticles and the geometry of the molecules determining the exposure of the fullerene aromatic systems. The analyzed functionalized fullerenes clearly demonstrated the group of potential modifications that exhibit significant potential in increasing of binding capacity of C 60 molecule. The addition of a single aromatic system on the surface of the fullerene considerably increased binding affinity toward the ligand molecule, relative to native fullerene. The addition of multiple aromatic systems contributed to the achievement of even better binding abilities of the considered nanosystems. Another class of modifications were substituents containing hydrogen bond donors and acceptors; however, the observed effects were less satisfactory, which was due to lower affinity values relative to nanostructures with aromatic substituents and the lack of any conformation of ligands that ensured the formation of hydrogen bonds. Such observations clearly confirm that in the case of this particular ligand molecule, the most important interactions are stacking interactions between aromatic moieties.\n\nThe last group of considered nanosytems, namely cube rhombellane homeomorphs, showed the lowest binding capacity relative to the ligand molecule. A large group of proposed compounds exhibited satisfying binding affinity towards the ligand molecule. The binding capacity of these nanostructures is strictly related with the structure of the external shell of these molecules. The example of molecules 360a and 360b clearly shows that two structural isomers can exhibit significant differences in this field.\n\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/8/980/s1, Table S1: Description of functionalized C 60 fullerene derivatives (FF_X) used during docking stage, Table S2: Description of cube rhombellanes (Core) and functionalized structures with external layer (C-rbl).

This approach frequently becomes inaccurate when some molecular species are present in low molecule numbers per cell because of the randomness inherent in chemical reaction kinetics. This randomness leads to fluctuations in intracellular molecule numbers and hence to cell-to-cell variability. The more accurate stochastic description of these systems is given by the Chemical Master Equation. The latter can be easily simulated by means of Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm. This method, however, often becomes computationally inefficient due to the large amount of sampling needed for accurate statistics. iNA provides a more efficient way to obtain the desired statistics via the system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation, a systematic analytical approximation method.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the respective type strains show a similarity higher than 98.4\u2009% and form a tight phylogenetic group. A dendrogram calculating the similarity of MALDI-TOF spectra confirmed the close relatedness of the four species that grouped in a monophyletic cluster in the neighbourhood of other species of the genus Cystobacter. The type strains shared similar fatty acid patterns of high complexity with iso-C15\u2009:\u20090, C16\u2009:\u20091\u03c95c and iso-C14\u2009:\u20090 3-OH as the major components. The vegetative cells of these species are uniformly long needle-shaped rods, and the myxospores are short rods, ovoid or irregularly spherical thus differing from the myxospores of species related to Cystobacter fuscus, the type species of this genus. Some enzymic and hydrolysing reactions of the type strains are described. As a result of the high relatedness and similarity of the four species, it is proposed to place them into one genus, and due to phylogenetic and morphological distinctness, the species should be classified in a genus distinct from the genus Cystobacter as Archangium gephyra (type strain M18T\u2009=\u2009DSM 2261T\u2009=\u2009ATCC 25201T\u2009=\u2009NBRC 100087T), Archangium disciforme comb. nov.

Since the family ArchangiaceaeJahn 1924 AL has priority over the family CystobacteraceaeMcCurdy 1970 AL, it is proposed to assign the genera Archangium, Anaeromyxobacter, Cystobacter, Hyalangium, Melittangium and Stigmatella to the family Archangiaceae.

Without an AHL receptor also apparent in the genome of A. gephyra, we sought to determine if AgpI was an uncommon example of an orphaned AHL synthase. Herein we report the bioinformatic assessment of AgpI and discovery of a second AHL synthase from Vitiosangium sp. During axenic cultivation conditions, no detectible AHL metabolites were observed in A. gephyra extracts. However, heterologous expression of each synthase in Escherichia coli provided detectible quantities of 3 AHL signals including 2 known AHLs, C8-AHL and C9-AHL. These results suggest that A. gephyra AHL production is dormant during axenic cultivation. The functional, orphaned AHL synthase, AgpI, is unique to A. gephyra, and its utility to the predatory myxobacterium remains unknown.",

A non-statistical distribution of CDs, i.e. alpha-CDs primarily located on the PEO chain and beta-CDs on PPO blocks of the polymer, is based on a variety of structural features and energetic preferences considering both potential as well as solvation energies. This selectivity becomes already obvious considering 1:1 complexes between PEO and PPO monomers and the two CDs, but is increasingly evident when calculating higher order ensembles. Besides the host-guest interaction, docking between CDs themselves is an important, also non-statistical, prerequisite for the self-assembly of highly ordered tubes. The formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between adjacent CDs in a tubular aggregate gives an important contribution to the overall stability of the molecular necklace. The net effect, based on the preferential interaction between host and guest as well as between the host molecules themselves, results in the formation of a stable, highly ordered macromolecular, multicomponent aggregate.",

In the case of block copolymer micelles, these parameters can influence the crystallinity of the core, which has implications for drug encapsulation and release. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine how the microstructure of poly(ethylene glycol-<ib</i-caprolactone) (PEG-<ib-</iPCL) copolymers contributes to the crystallinity of their hydrophobic PCL micelle cores. Using a library of PEG-<ib</i-PCL copolymers with PEG number-average molecular weight (<iM<subn</sub</i) values of 2, 5, and 10 kDa and weight fractions of PCL (<if<subPCL</sub</i) ranging from 0.11 to 0.67, the thermal behaviour and morphology were studied in blends, bulk, and micelles using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD), and Synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Compared to PEG and PCL homopolymers, the block copolymers displayed reduced crystallinity in the bulk phase and the individual blocks had a large influence on the crystallisation of one another. The <if<subPCL</sub</i was determined to be the dominant contributor to the extent and order of crystallisation of the two blocks.

A bottlebrush architecture can circumvent both shortcomings owing to extended backbone configurations due to side chain crowding and molecular dynamics substantially free of chain entanglements. However, until now, network morphologies have not been reported in AB bottlebrush block copolymers, notwithstanding favorable mean-field predictions.

It is initiated by the introduction of p-nitrophenyl groups; such nitrophenyl conjugated copolymers are stable in an organic milieu and in a dry state but are seen to react easily with amino-containing molecules including small peptides. Among them, introduction of 2-pyridyl disulfide groups after coupling with 2-(2-pyridyldithio)ethylamine enables the selective attachment of thiol-containing molecules. The released thiopyridone in such thiol-disulfide reactions can be used to quantify the content of 2-pyridyl disulfide groups. In addition, a new type of modified copolymers was developed for the radioisotope (125I) labeling purpose that consists of a reaction of nitrophenyl conjugated copolymers with hydrazine and a subsequent coupling with N-succinimidyl 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate (Bolton-Hunter reagent). Adsorption studies of 125I-labeled and 2-pyridyl disulfide conjugated copolymers on polystyrene particles are consistent with previous determinations of surface coverage using other technologies, in turn indicating that this new chemical modification does not alter their surfactant properties on hydrophobic solid phase. The coating of common hydrophobic surfaces with 2-pyridyl disulfide conjugated copolymers has been demonstrated as a general and robust immobilization method to generate a high-sensitivity bioactive surface with low nonspecific binding. The optimal space between immobilized ligands can also be controlled by incubating the solid phase with solutions containing mixtures with different ratios of unmodified and modified copolymers.",

Different micellar morphologies resulting from the selfassembly of different block copolymer classes are depicted in Scheme 4. Generally, polymer micelles can be divided into three main categories based on the intramolecular forces that control their formation: (1) micelles formed by hydrophobic interactions; (2) micelles resulting from electrostatic interactions; (3) non-covalently bonded polymeric micelles.

AB- and ABA-type di- and triblock copolymers as well as statistical copolymers of HAAGE and ethylene oxide are prepared in a molecular weight range between 2600 and 12\u2009000 g mol<sup-1</sup with low dispersities (\u00d0 &lt; 1.2). Cleavage of the acetal protecting group after the polymerization is achieved by mild acidic treatment, releasing multiple free hydroxamic acids tethered to the polyether backbone. The chelation properties of different polymer architectures (statistical versus diblock and ABA triblock) are investigated and compared with regard to the number and position of hydroxamic acids. Separation of the hydroxamic acid units by at least 5 ethylene glycol monomer units is found to be essential for high Fe(III) binding efficiency, while block copolymers are observed to be the best-suited architecture for polymer network and hydrogel formation via Fe(III) chelation.",

The hard segments were made up of monodisperse crystallisable tetra-amide segments (T6T6T) comprising terephthalate (T) and hexamethylenediamine (6) groups. The length of the segments making up the soft phase was varied from 600 to 10,000\u00a0g/mol. The water absorption of the PEO-based copolymers was found to increase exponentially with the PEO concentration. The modulus and yield strength decreased with water absorption and this effect seemed to be mainly the result of a lowering hard segment content caused by their swelling with water. Upon wetting, the copolymers demonstrated an increased yield strain. Furthermore, the ultimate properties were sensitive to the hard segment content, the molecular weight of the copolymer and whether or not strain-hardening could take place. Upon wetting, the fracture stresses decreased whereas the fracture strains increased. The true fracture stresses of the wet samples were as high as those of the dry samples for reasonable amounts of absorbed water.",

Ceftazidime binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), enzymes located on the inner membrane of the bacterial cell wall, resulting in the weakening of the bacterial cell wall and cell lysis. Compared to the second and first generation cephalosporins, ceftazidime is more active against gram-negative bacteria and less active against gram-positive bacteria. Ceftazidine also crosses the blood-brain barrier and reaches therapeutic concentrations in the central nervous system (CNS). PBPs participate in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall, and in reshaping the cell wall during cell division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity.']",

Four additional species were recently described from Eucalyptus and Syzygium cumini in China as well as S. aromaticum and Eucalyptus in Indonesia. Inoculation trials have shown that all Celoporthe species, including those that have not been found on Eucalyptus species in nature, are pathogenic to Eucalyptus and they are thus potentially threatening to commercial Eucalyptus forestry. New isolates, morphologically similar to Celoporthe, have been collected from S. legatti in South Africa and S. guineense in Zambia. Multigene phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences of the ITS region, TEF1\u03b1 gene and two areas of the \u03b2-tubulin gene revealed additional cryptic species in Celoporthe. Phylogenetic data were supported by morphological differences. These resulted in the description of two previously unknown species of Celoporthe, namely C. fontana and C. woodiana, for two of these cryptic groups, while the third group represented C. dispersa. These species all can readily infect Eucalyptus as well as several species of Syzygium, the latter of which are native to Africa.",

In 1930 he proposed a \u03c3/\u03c0 separation theory to explain the restricted rotation of alkenes (compounds containing a C=C double bond). This model extended a 1929 interpretation of the bonding in triplet oxygen by Lennard-Jones. According to H\u00fcckel, only the ethene \u03c3 bond is axially symmetric about the C-C axis, but the \u03c0 bond is not; this restricts rotation.

Especially the mapping correlation training and the SMILES prompting show significantly lower scores when being removed, showing that the capability of bridging versatile subdomains is essential to accomplish the conversational molecular design.

Towards Alignment with Structural DiversityIn this experiment, we show that our method enables LLMs to better generate diverse molecules compared to the existing decoding schemes for diverse sequence generation.To validate the consistent improvement, we implement our fine-tuning method and decoding schemes on two models specialized in the chemical domain: BioT5 + (Pei et al., 2024) and MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022).\n\nTasks.We consider description-guided molecule generation using the ChEBI-20 dataset, which includes training and test sets (Edwards et al., 2021).Note that the training dataset has also been used to pre-train the base LLMs, BioT5 + and MolT5, i.e., not an external dataset.The test dataset is unobserved during both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases.Each data point consists of a pair of a description and a ground-truth example molecule that satisfies the description.\n\nIn our experiments, we consider generating 50 molecules for each description in the ChEBI-20 test dataset involving 3300 molecular descriptions.We then evaluate both the structural diversity of the generated molecules and how well they satisfy the given descriptions.13.The Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm (Fruchterman & Reingold, 1991) embeds each molecule in a 2-dimensional space based on Tanimoto similarity.Here, a low distance yields a high Tanimoto similarity.Each dot, shaded circle, and edge represent accepted molecules, distinct clusters (used to measure NCircles), and a pair with similarity above 0.65, respectively.Our method better captures the molecular diversity.\n\nMetrics.To measure the similarity between two molecules, we use Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015), which based on distance of molecular structures from fingerprints.To be specific, we consider the following metrics for generated molecules:\n\n\u2022 The number of accepted and unique molecules (Accepted & unique): This metric measures the number of valid and unique molecules satisfying the given description.3\n\n\u2022 The number of circles (NCircles; Xie et al., 2023): This metric considers both the quality and diversity of generated molecules.For the accepted molecules satisfying the given description, this metric counts the number of maximum distinct clusters with Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015) below a threshold h, i.e., indicating chemical space coverage (illustrated in Figure 6).",

Given a molecule and these combined inputs, we then select the one that includes the correct answer from the options.We generate questions based on the textual descriptions used for the cross-modal retrieval task in Section 5.2.Since the ATC dataset consists of brief labels for molecules, we restrict our question generation to descriptions and pharmacodynamics datasets.Note that the only difference between the options comes from option  , which makes the task much harder compared to the cross-modal retrieval task in Section 5.2.In Appendix C.2, we offer details for generating processes and statistics for questions and answer datasets.\n\nEmpirical Results.In Table 3, we have the following observations:\n\n1) Comparing to Table 1, we observe that despite having far fewer options for retrieval, most models learning representation space (i.e., KV-PLM, MoMu, MoleculeSTM, and AMOLE) perform much worse in the task.This is because the model must discern based solely on the subtle differences between the options provided, requiring the model to have a more fine-grained understanding of molecules than cross-modal retrieval.2) On the other hand, AMOLE consistently outperforms baseline models in this task, showcasing its ability to extract more intricate information from the slight variations in options through the inference of related expertise.In conclusion, we posit that AMOLE offers benefits in tasks that demand a more intricate understanding of molecules, achieved by integrating additional expertise.",

Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular.

However, it also makes some mistakes (e.g., Iodoacetic acid is not liquid), and the evaluation scores are not comparable with the tuned models, proving the challenge of this task. As for the smaller models, KV-PLM shows no advantages in description generation, and the reason may be that its encoder architecture limits the range of descriptions that the model can obtain.

The LLM baseline ChatGPT possesses certain molecular knowledge and can always return valid molecules, while the mastered molecules are limited and therefore can not reach a high accuracy under the 1-shot setting.

However, to process the multi-modal conversational molecular design data, it is necessary for our model to capture the associations and convert between the two languages. We apply the following two strategies to construct more mapping data for our model. Molecule Mapping Correlation. We recognize the molecular entities in the literature corpus with the SciSpacy tool (Neumann et al., 2019) and then query for their SMILES from PubChem (Kim et al., 2016). Given the natural language segments, the molecule generation model is required to generate SMILES expressions for all the molecules that appeared in it sequentially. Conversely, the molecule understanding model is expected to generate the standard names of the given molecules. In this way, we help ChatMol build the parallel association with the least supervision.\n\nNotice that the toolkit and KB can also play a role as plugins during the downstream inferencing, we provide the automatically-annotated entity SMILES strings as the prompts given text descriptions for molecule generation. To avoid information leakage, we forcefully remove those SMILES strings in the prompts that are the same as molecules in the answers.\n\nDual Augmentation. Considering that the molecule understanding (molecule-to-text generation) and molecule-to-text generation are a pair of mutual tasks, while existing molecule SMILES strings are much more than molecular property descriptions in natural language, we can take the idea of dual learning Xia et al., 2017), a common mechanism in neural machine translation, to alleviate the challenge of lacking parallel data. Specifically, the fine-tuned molecule understanding model can generate augmented text descriptions for any given molecule, which can feedback on the molecule generation training.\n\n\nInjecting Molecular Knowledge\n\nTo get an in-depth comprehension of the given chemical language expressions and to generate more reasonable and informative natural language descriptions, our model is injected with two types of molecular knowledge.\n\nExperimental Property Knowledge. We expect the model to understand the molecular structures and to master properties explicitly described in the natural language. We collect 15 types of physical and chemical properties determined experimentally from PubChem database (Kim et al., 2016), including solubility, color, corrosivity and so on.

Hence, there is an urgent need for better approaches to generating diverse, novel molecular graphs from a given textual description (Brown et al., 2019).Against this background, this paper aims to answer the following research question: How can we generate a diverse and novel collection of molecular graphs that match a given textual description?\n\nIn this work, we introduce 3M-Diffusion, a novel multimodal molecular diffusion method, for generating highquality, diverse, novel molecular graphs given a textual description.Inspried by text-guided image generation using a diffusion model on the latent space (Rombach et al., 2022), 3M-Diffusion is trained to generate molecules from the latent distribution of a molecular graph autoencoder (See Figure 1).This enables the diffusion process to focus on the high-level semantics of molecules.We find that this approach is particularly well-suited for discrete molecular graph modality because it offloads the challenge of modeling a discrete and diverse distribution to the autoencoder and simplifies the diffusion process by restricting it to the continuous, latent feature space.Since graph data consists of both node attributes and graph structure, which differs significantly from the sequential and contextual nature of text data, to align the latent space of the text and molecular\n\n\nRelated Work\n\n\nMolecule Generation",

Cefepime is normally used to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia and infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and is also indicated for the empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. The popularity of its third-generation predecessors, its clinical efficacy, and the high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria might be some of the factors leading to an increase in the use of cefepime. The activity of cefepime against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus is due to its high stability toward beta-lactamases. In general, cefepime seems to be well tolerated; however, patients treated with this antibiotic, especially those with renal impairment, may develop neurotoxicity.']",

Description Salvia uliginosa is an herbaceous perennial growing up to tall in one season, with multiple thin stems and yellow-green lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant quickly spreads on underground runners and is readily divided. The bright azure-blue flowers are long with a white beeline in the throat pointing toward the nectar and pollen. They grow in whorls beginning in summer until fall, with many flowers coming into bloom at the same time. Cyanosalvianin, the blue pigment from the flowers of S. uliginosa, is a metalloanthocyanin, a complex formed of six molecules of the anthocyanin type, six molecules of the flavone type and two magnesium ions.",

Towards Alignment with Structural DiversityIn this experiment, we show that our method enables LLMs to better generate diverse molecules compared to the existing decoding schemes for diverse sequence generation.To validate the consistent improvement, we implement our fine-tuning method and decoding schemes on two models specialized in the chemical domain: BioT5 + (Pei et al., 2024) and MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022).\n\nTasks.We consider description-guided molecule generation using the ChEBI-20 dataset, which includes training and test sets (Edwards et al., 2021).Note that the training dataset has also been used to pre-train the base LLMs, BioT5 + and MolT5, i.e., not an external dataset.The test dataset is unobserved during both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases.Each data point consists of a pair of a description and a ground-truth example molecule that satisfies the description.\n\nIn our experiments, we consider generating 50 molecules for each description in the ChEBI-20 test dataset involving 3300 molecular descriptions.We then evaluate both the structural diversity of the generated molecules and how well they satisfy the given descriptions.13.The Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm (Fruchterman & Reingold, 1991) embeds each molecule in a 2-dimensional space based on Tanimoto similarity.Here, a low distance yields a high Tanimoto similarity.Each dot, shaded circle, and edge represent accepted molecules, distinct clusters (used to measure NCircles), and a pair with similarity above 0.65, respectively.Our method better captures the molecular diversity.\n\nMetrics.To measure the similarity between two molecules, we use Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015), which based on distance of molecular structures from fingerprints.To be specific, we consider the following metrics for generated molecules:\n\n\u2022 The number of accepted and unique molecules (Accepted & unique): This metric measures the number of valid and unique molecules satisfying the given description.3\n\n\u2022 The number of circles (NCircles; Xie et al., 2023): This metric considers both the quality and diversity of generated molecules.For the accepted molecules satisfying the given description, this metric counts the number of maximum distinct clusters with Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015) below a threshold h, i.e., indicating chemical space coverage (illustrated in Figure 6).",

Given a molecule and these combined inputs, we then select the one that includes the correct answer from the options.We generate questions based on the textual descriptions used for the cross-modal retrieval task in Section 5.2.Since the ATC dataset consists of brief labels for molecules, we restrict our question generation to descriptions and pharmacodynamics datasets.Note that the only difference between the options comes from option  , which makes the task much harder compared to the cross-modal retrieval task in Section 5.2.In Appendix C.2, we offer details for generating processes and statistics for questions and answer datasets.\n\nEmpirical Results.In Table 3, we have the following observations:\n\n1) Comparing to Table 1, we observe that despite having far fewer options for retrieval, most models learning representation space (i.e., KV-PLM, MoMu, MoleculeSTM, and AMOLE) perform much worse in the task.This is because the model must discern based solely on the subtle differences between the options provided, requiring the model to have a more fine-grained understanding of molecules than cross-modal retrieval.2) On the other hand, AMOLE consistently outperforms baseline models in this task, showcasing its ability to extract more intricate information from the slight variations in options through the inference of related expertise.In conclusion, we posit that AMOLE offers benefits in tasks that demand a more intricate understanding of molecules, achieved by integrating additional expertise.",

With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular.

This tool is very well suited for simple diatomic molecules such as dihydrogen, dioxygen, and carbon monoxide but becomes more complex when discussing even comparatively simple polyatomic molecules, such as methane.

However, it also makes some mistakes (e.g., Iodoacetic acid is not liquid), and the evaluation scores are not comparable with the tuned models, proving the challenge of this task. As for the smaller models, KV-PLM shows no advantages in description generation, and the reason may be that its encoder architecture limits the range of descriptions that the model can obtain. The MLM method-dominated MolT5 adapts worse on PCdes compared with ChEBI-20 the original paper provides, indicating that the over-pre-training may hurt the model generalization capability.\n\nMolecule Generation Results. For molecule generation, our method generates obviously more similar results with ground truth molecules than baselines. The LLM baseline ChatGPT possesses certain molecular knowledge and can always return valid molecules, while the mastered molecules are limited and therefore can not reach a high accuracy under the 1-shot setting. KV-PLM, in contrast, applies the retrieval setting and finds out the bestmatched molecules from the given pools, therefore can get higher hit scores, while does not really fit the open scenarios.

The model can solve language tasks, chemical tasks, and cross-domain tasks, without the need for task-specific fine-tuning or retraining. The chemical tasks that the model can solve are forward reaction prediction and retro-synthesis. The forward reaction task is about predicting the outcome of a chemical reaction based on the starting materials, and the retro-synthesis task is about predicting the starting materials required to synthesize a given chemical compound. The cross-domain tasks that the model can solve are text-to-molecule (text-conditional de novo generation) and molecule-to-text (molecular captioning). The text-to-molecule task is where the model takes a textual description of a molecule as an input and generates its SMILES representation. The molecule-to-text task is where the model takes a molecule represented as SMILES and generates its human-readable textual description.

However, to process the multi-modal conversational molecular design data, it is necessary for our model to capture the associations and convert between the two languages. We apply the following two strategies to construct more mapping data for our model. Molecule Mapping Correlation. We recognize the molecular entities in the literature corpus with the SciSpacy tool (Neumann et al., 2019) and then query for their SMILES from PubChem (Kim et al., 2016). Given the natural language segments, the molecule generation model is required to generate SMILES expressions for all the molecules that appeared in it sequentially. Conversely, the molecule understanding model is expected to generate the standard names of the given molecules. In this way, we help ChatMol build the parallel association with the least supervision.\n\nNotice that the toolkit and KB can also play a role as plugins during the downstream inferencing, we provide the automatically-annotated entity SMILES strings as the prompts given text descriptions for molecule generation. To avoid information leakage, we forcefully remove those SMILES strings in the prompts that are the same as molecules in the answers.\n\nDual Augmentation. Considering that the molecule understanding (molecule-to-text generation) and molecule-to-text generation are a pair of mutual tasks, while existing molecule SMILES strings are much more than molecular property descriptions in natural language, we can take the idea of dual learning Xia et al., 2017), a common mechanism in neural machine translation, to alleviate the challenge of lacking parallel data. Specifically, the fine-tuned molecule understanding model can generate augmented text descriptions for any given molecule, which can feedback on the molecule generation training.\n\n\nInjecting Molecular Knowledge\n\nTo get an in-depth comprehension of the given chemical language expressions and to generate more reasonable and informative natural language descriptions, our model is injected with two types of molecular knowledge.\n\nExperimental Property Knowledge. We expect the model to understand the molecular structures and to master properties explicitly described in the natural language. We collect 15 types of physical and chemical properties determined experimentally from PubChem database (Kim et al., 2016), including solubility, color, corrosivity and so on. These properties can be directly described in natural language and provide supervision signals for molecule understanding.",

It plays an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. The TRAF6 of Japanese scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis (designated as MyTRAF6) was identified and characterized in this study. The full-length cDNA of MyTRAF6 was 2,407 bp, which consisted of 239-bp 5'-terminal untranslated region, 1,974-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 657 amino acids, 194-bp of 3'-terminal untranslated region followed by a canonical polyadenylation signal sequence AATAAA and a poly (A) tail. The predicted amino acid sequence of MyTRAF6 contained the characteristic motifs of TRAF proteins, including a Zinc finger of RING-type, two Zinc fingers of TRAF-type, and a MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain. It had an overall identity of 43-96% with those of other TRAF6s, the highest identity (96%) with Chlamys farreri TRAF6, and the least identity (43%) with Meleagris gallopavo TRAF6. Phylogenetic analysis classified MyTRAF6 as a true TRAF6 ortholog. In addition, the promoter of MyTRAF6 was also identified by genome walking. It contained several potential transcription factor-binding sites and three single nucleotide polymorphisms. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MyTRAF6 was highly expressed in hemocytes of adult M. yessoensis. MyTRAF6 transcript level in the hemocytes reached a maximum 6 h after Vibrio anguilarum challenge. The results indicated that MyTRAF6 may fulfill an important function during M. yessoensis bacterial infection. It could be a key effector molecule involved in the innate defense of molluscs.",

In the present study, TMs from both muscles of Yesso scallop were purified and their stabilities were compared by circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). From the CD data, the apparent melting temperature and the apparent free energy of folding at 20 degrees C were calculated to be 30.5 degrees C and -13.4 kJ/mol, and 36.0 degrees C and -31.9 kJ/mol for the striated and smooth muscle TMs, respectively. From the DSC data, DeltaH values were calculated to be 1.87 x 10(3) and 2.19 x 10(3) kJ/mol for striated and smooth muscle TMs. These results suggest that smooth muscle TM has higher thermostability than striated muscle TM. The amino acid residues responsible for such stability difference were considered to be the six amino acid substitutions in the middle region of the TM molecules.",

In this study, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to investigate levels of genetic diversity within M. yessoensis cultured stocks and compare them with wild populations. Six pairs of primer combinations generated 368 loci among 332 individuals, in four cultured and three wild populations. High polymorphism at AFLP markers was found within both cultured and wild M. yessoensis populations. The percentage of polymorphic loci ranged from 61.04% to 72.08%, while the mean heterozygosity ranged from 0.2116 to 0.2596. Compared with wild populations, the four hatchery populations showed significant genetic changes, such as lower expected heterozygosity and percentage of polymorphic loci, and smaller frequency of private alleles, all indicative of a reduction in genetic diversity. Some genetic structures were associated with the geographical distribution of samples; with all samples from Dalian and Japan being closely related, while the population from Russia fell into a distinct clade in the phylogenetic analysis. The genetic information derived from this study indicated that intentional or accidental release of selected Japanese scallops into natural sea areas might result in disturbance of local gene pools and loss of genetic variability. We recommend monitoring the genetic variability of selected hatchery populations to enhance conservation of natural Japanese scallop resources.",

Reaction of the scallop to this effect was evaluated by a set of biomarkers, including general metabolism enzymes (acid and alkaline phosphatase activities - AcPase, ALP), and oxidative stress parameters (catalase antioxidant enzyme activity - CAT and levels of damage for DNA, lipids and proteins). Experiment results show that when copper is accumulated in tissues, enzyme activity changes are similar and have phasic character. The dynamics of these changes depends on the copper accumulation levels in tissues. Unlike enzyme reaction to copper accumulation, oxidative damage of biologic molecules changes in tissues in different ways. Copper enters into a scallop's organism, mainly through the gills, where there is a more expressed reaction of biomarkers compared to the digestive gland.",

IUPAC-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an -oic acid suffix. For example, butyric acid (C3H7CO2H) is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. For nomenclature of complex molecules containing a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the parent chain even if there are other substituents, such as 3-chloropropanoic acid. Alternately, it can be named as a \"carboxy\" or \"carboxylic acid\" substituent on another parent structure, such as 2-carboxyfuran. The carboxylate anion (R\u2013COO\u2212 or RCO2\u2212) of a carboxylic acid is usually named with the suffix -ate, in keeping with the general pattern of -ic acid and -ate for a conjugate acid and its conjugate base, respectively.

It is multifunctional molecule with two secondary alcohols, four carboxylic acid groups, and two amide groups. In aqueous solution, it is highly ionized, but the term rhizoferrin is still applied to these species. The compound is a siderophore, which means that is it serves to transport iron from outside the cell into a host organism. Rhizoferrin is derived from conjugating a pair of citric acid molecules. The pair are connected via a diamide linkage between the putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane) and one of the two unhindered carboxylic acid groups of citric acid. The result is a C2-symmetric hexadentate ligand. A related siderophore is staphyloferrin A, where the two citric acid groups are linked by D-ornithine. The structure of rhizoferrin was established by total synthesis.",

Hence, vinylogy is a useful heuristic for the prediction of the behavior of systems that are structurally similar but contain intervening C=C bonds that are conjugated to the attached functional groups. For example, a key property of carboxylic acids is their Br\u00f8nsted acidity. The simplest carboxylic acid, formic acid (HC(=O)\u2013OH), is a moderately strong organic acid with a pKa of 3.7. We would expect vinylogous carboxylic acids to have similar acidity. Indeed, the vinylog of formic acid, 2-formyl-1-ethen-1-ol, HC(=O)\u2013CH=CH\u2013OH has a substantial Br\u00f8nsted acidity, with an estimated pKa ~ 5\u20136.

However, to process the multi-modal conversational molecular design data, it is necessary for our model to capture the associations and convert between the two languages. We apply the following two strategies to construct more mapping data for our model. Molecule Mapping Correlation. We recognize the molecular entities in the literature corpus with the SciSpacy tool (Neumann et al., 2019) and then query for their SMILES from PubChem (Kim et al., 2016). Given the natural language segments, the molecule generation model is required to generate SMILES expressions for all the molecules that appeared in it sequentially. Conversely, the molecule understanding model is expected to generate the standard names of the given molecules. In this way, we help ChatMol build the parallel association with the least supervision.\n\nNotice that the toolkit and KB can also play a role as plugins during the downstream inferencing, we provide the automatically-annotated entity SMILES strings as the prompts given text descriptions for molecule generation. To avoid information leakage, we forcefully remove those SMILES strings in the prompts that are the same as molecules in the answers.\n\nDual Augmentation. Considering that the molecule understanding (molecule-to-text generation) and molecule-to-text generation are a pair of mutual tasks, while existing molecule SMILES strings are much more than molecular property descriptions in natural language, we can take the idea of dual learning Xia et al., 2017), a common mechanism in neural machine translation, to alleviate the challenge of lacking parallel data. Specifically, the fine-tuned molecule understanding model can generate augmented text descriptions for any given molecule, which can feedback on the molecule generation training.\n\n\nInjecting Molecular Knowledge\n\nTo get an in-depth comprehension of the given chemical language expressions and to generate more reasonable and informative natural language descriptions, our model is injected with two types of molecular knowledge.\n\nExperimental Property Knowledge. We expect the model to understand the molecular structures and to master properties explicitly described in the natural language. We collect 15 types of physical and chemical properties determined experimentally from PubChem database (Kim et al., 2016), including solubility, color, corrosivity and so on. These properties can be directly described in natural language and provide supervision signals for molecule understanding.",

Towards Alignment with Structural DiversityIn this experiment, we show that our method enables LLMs to better generate diverse molecules compared to the existing decoding schemes for diverse sequence generation.To validate the consistent improvement, we implement our fine-tuning method and decoding schemes on two models specialized in the chemical domain: BioT5 + (Pei et al., 2024) and MolT5 (Edwards et al., 2022).\n\nTasks.We consider description-guided molecule generation using the ChEBI-20 dataset, which includes training and test sets (Edwards et al., 2021).Note that the training dataset has also been used to pre-train the base LLMs, BioT5 + and MolT5, i.e., not an external dataset.The test dataset is unobserved during both the pre-training and fine-tuning phases.Each data point consists of a pair of a description and a ground-truth example molecule that satisfies the description.\n\nIn our experiments, we consider generating 50 molecules for each description in the ChEBI-20 test dataset involving 3300 molecular descriptions.We then evaluate both the structural diversity of the generated molecules and how well they satisfy the given descriptions.13.The Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm (Fruchterman & Reingold, 1991) embeds each molecule in a 2-dimensional space based on Tanimoto similarity.Here, a low distance yields a high Tanimoto similarity.Each dot, shaded circle, and edge represent accepted molecules, distinct clusters (used to measure NCircles), and a pair with similarity above 0.65, respectively.Our method better captures the molecular diversity.\n\nMetrics.To measure the similarity between two molecules, we use Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015), which based on distance of molecular structures from fingerprints.To be specific, we consider the following metrics for generated molecules:\n\n\u2022 The number of accepted and unique molecules (Accepted & unique): This metric measures the number of valid and unique molecules satisfying the given description.3\n\n\u2022 The number of circles (NCircles; Xie et al., 2023): This metric considers both the quality and diversity of generated molecules.For the accepted molecules satisfying the given description, this metric counts the number of maximum distinct clusters with Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al., 2015) below a threshold h, i.e., indicating chemical space coverage (illustrated in Figure 6).",

The database is organized in a single, two-dimensional array flat model format where elements in each column are the same type of data for a given molecular descriptor and elements in the same row relate to the same molecule. There are a total of 38 columns (i.e. 38 descriptors for each molecule) and 67,064,204 rows (i.e. 67,064,204 molecules in the database). The column numbering, names, data types, and descriptions are listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\n\nTechnical Validation\n\nTesting of generated natural product-like molecules. From the 406,919 known, valid, unique, canonical, natural product SMILES strings in the COCONUT 11 database with stereochemistry removed, 81,384 (20%) were held-out and the remaining 325,535 (80%) were used to train and validate the recurrent neural network to generate natural product-like SMILES. Of the 81,384 known natural products that were held out as a test set from the training dataset, 30,229 (37% of held-out set) known natural products were reproduced in the generated natural product-like SMILES database, confirming the trained model can generate actual natural product molecules. In addition, the natural product likeness scores (NP Score) 42 and NPClassifier 43 pathway distributions of the generated natural product-like molecules have low KL divergence scores of 0.064 and 0.047 nats respectively when referenced against the observed distributions of known natural products from the COCONUT database 11 , indicating that natural product-like molecules have been generated.\n\n\nUsage Notes\n\nThis generated natural product-like SMILES database covering novel physiochemical and structural space may serve as starting points for high throughput in silico discovery of functional natural products. Aside from potential food, agrochemical, and therapeutic applications, there has been increasing consumer demand for natural product alternatives to synthetic ingredients for their perceived health and wellness benefits 49,50 . Such natural alternatives are also amenable to sustainable manufacturing processes via synthetic biology approaches 51,52 , adding to their attractiveness as an answer from chemical manufacturers to environmental regulators 53 on issues of climate change, pollution, and resource depletion 54 .\n\n\ncode availability",

The former includes physical and chemical properties from wet-lab experiments recorded in molecule KBs in the form of natural language. The latter includes the chemical bond, molecular ring and aromaticity information, and this helps the spatial structure information reflected in the SMILES expression become more intuitive. Given the chemical SMILES following the task prefixes, our model is trained to generate the natural language answers constructed with the above information.\n\nOur main contributions are as followed: (1) We propose conversational molecular design, an innovative task adopting natural language as the basic medium of human-machine interaction for conducting low-barrier molecular discovery; (2) We provide ChatMol, which is a pre-trained model that can perform well in the new task with the enhancement of molecular knowledge and chemical-natural language associations; (3) Experiment results prove the challenge of the task we propose and also the effectiveness of our method, achieving better performance with much fewer pre-training steps.\n\n\nConversational Molecular Design\n\nIn this section, we clarify the definition and related settings of the newly proposed task.\n\n\nTask Definition\n\nIn each turn of the molecular design, both the human user and the intelligent system may provide molecules expressed in chemical language or chemical properties expressed in natural language. Given the conversation history H(M, T ) which contains molecules M 1,2,...,p and chemical property descriptions T 1,2,...,q , we focus on two main functions that researchers expect the intelligent system to do:\n\n(1) Molecule understanding: The system is required to generate a paragraph of property descriptions T i for the molecule M i in H.\n\n(2) Molecule generation: The system is also supposed to generate a specific molecule M j that meets the requirements in H, which may be text descriptions or the molecules that the target has to be similar with. Since there may be more than one molecule matching the descriptions, the human user can iteratively replenish property descriptions T j+1 , and the system would generate a modified molecule M j+1 according to the current text descriptions T 1,2,...,j+1 and the last-round result M j (with the input as \"it looks like M j \").\n\n\nEvaluation Metrics",

Male Wistar rats in groups of 6 animals each were fed fructose-rich diets or standard chow for 3 weeks and treated with 100 mg/kg/day or 200 mg/kg/day of plant extract or vehicle for 3 subsequent weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured every three days using the indirect tail cuff method. Systolic blood pressure was higher in fructose-fed rats (142+/-2 mm Hg, p &lt; 0.01) compared with the controls (112+/-2 mm Hg), and was lower in Dorstenia psilurus-treated groups (127+/-2 and 119+/-1 mm Hg for the dose of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively) compared with the fructose-fed rats. Plasma insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides were higher on the fructose-rich diet compared with the controls. Plasma insulin and cholesterol were lower in the Dorstenia psilurus-treated groups. These results suggest that, Dorstenia psilurus treatment could prevent and reverse high blood pressure induced by a diet rich in fructose probably by improvement of plasma insulin levels. The plant extract might prove useful in the treatment and/or prevention of hypertension.",

For the comparably difficult case (line 2) that provides more general and vague descriptions, baseline models fail to generate correct molecules and precise descriptions,  while ChatMol+ eventually succeeds even when it makes a mistake in the first turn (which is not a valid molecule). ChatMol also grasps some key required substructures (e.g., piperidine, tertiary alcohol, monochlorobenzene) and generates a quite similar molecule, and meanwhile provides much more concise descriptions compared with baseline models. Nevertheless, the models trained in a targeted manner (MolT5 and our models) have overall better performances than T5 in many cases, as shown in line 3. Imagine the future where we can apply the technology of conversational molecular design for drug discovery, describing our command for structures and functions and obtaining possible molecules from the model outputs. Besides, readable descriptions can be generated when chemical researchers or learners input any unfamiliar molecules just as we do in the case study. Currently, the model and the data scales are both small, and the modifications and descriptions are also not so granular. It is possible to get stronger conversational molecular design systems that apply larger models with more fine-grained training data, and have powerful knowledge memory to do more reliable predictions.\n\n\nRelated Work\n\n\nKnowledgeable Models\n\nThough the deep learning models have the ability to absorb commonsense knowledge from large-scale training data in an unsupervised manner, directly injecting knowledge into models still shows its effectiveness.

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

A fundamental principle of these theories is that as atoms bond to form molecules, a certain number of atomic orbitals combine to form the same number of molecular orbitals, although the electrons involved may be redistributed among the orbitals. This tool is very well suited for simple diatomic molecules such as dihydrogen, dioxygen, and carbon monoxide but becomes more complex when discussing even comparatively simple polyatomic molecules, such as methane.

In the present study, a homologous series of OACs with even chain lengths (n = 12-20) have been synthesized, and their thermotropic and chaotropic phase transitions have been characterized. The role of various anions (Cl(-), Br(-), I(-), NO3(-), SO4(2-), ClO3(-), ClO4(-)) on the phase behavior of O-stearoylcholine was investigated by calorimetric, spectroscopic, and turbidimetric approaches. The results obtained revealed that in aqueous dispersion O-stearoylcholine undergoes a cooperative phase transition from a gel phase to a micellar structure and that the transition temperature increases when the counterions are changed in the Hofmeister series. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies showed that O-stearoylcholine iodide forms an interdigitated bilayer structure, with the polymethylene chain adopting an all-trans conformation. The Hofmeister effect and phase behavior were explained using the concepts of matching water affinities, water penetration into the bilayer, and electrostatic repulsion. It was also observed that one counterion per molecule is sufficient to strongly modulate the phase properties of the lipid/surfactant. ",

This response is known as the phase behavior of the bilayer. Broadly, at a given temperature a lipid bilayer can exist in either a liquid or a solid phase. The solid phase is commonly referred to as a \u201cgel\u201d phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they undergo a transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are constrained to the two dimensional plane of the membrane, but in liquid phase bilayers the molecules diffuse freely within this plane. Thus, in a liquid bilayer a given lipid will rapidly exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second and will, through the process of a random walk, migrate over long distances.",

It can also be viewed as the cyclic dimer of oxiranedione (C2O3), the hypothetical anhydride of oxalic acid. In 1998, Paolo Strazzolini and others synthesized this compound by reacting oxalyl chloride (COCl)2 or the bromide (COBr)2 with a suspension of silver oxalate (Ag2C2O4) in diethyl ether at \u221215 \u00b0C, followed by evaporation of the solvent at low temperature and pressure. The substance is stable when dissolved in ether and trichloromethane at \u221230 \u00b0C, but decomposes into a 1:1 mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) upon heating to 0 \u00b0C.

The experiment revealed that a short intermolecular interaction was present between the oxygen atoms of dioxane and bromine atoms. The O\u2212Br distance in the crystal was measured at 2.71 \u00c5, which indicates a strong interaction between the bromine and oxygen atoms. In addition, the distance is smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of oxygen and bromine (3.35 \u00c5). The angle between the O\u2212Br and Br\u2212Br bond is about 180\u00b0.

Monooxygenase-expressing bacteria have been shown to degrade dioxane via growth-supporting as well as cometabolic mechanisms. In this study, the intermediates of dioxane degradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria were determined by triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. The major intermediates were identified as 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), ethylene glycol, glycolate, and oxalate. Studies with uniformly labeled 14C dioxane showed that over 50% of the dioxane was mineralized to CO2 by CB1190, while 5% became biomass-associated after 48 h. Volatile organic acids and non-volatiles, respectively, accounted for 20 and 11% of the radiolabeled carbon. Although strains cometabolizing dioxane exhibited limited transformation capacities, nearly half of the initial dioxane was recovered as CO2. On the basis of these analytical results, we propose a pathway for dioxane oxidation by monooxygenase-expressing cells in which dioxane is first converted to 2-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane, which is spontaneously oxidized to HEAA. During a second monooxygenation step, HEAA is further hydroxylated, resulting in a mixture of dihydroxyethoxyacetic acids with a hydroxyl group at the ortho or para position. After cleavage of the second ether bond, small organic molecules such as ethylene glycol, glycolate, glyoxalate, and oxalate are progressively formed, which are then mineralized to CO2 via common cellular metabolic pathways. Bioremediation of dioxane via this pathway is not expected to cause an accumulation of toxic compounds in the environment.",

This has motivated us to develop a version of the TraPPE-UA force field specifically for five- and six-membered cyclic alkanes and ethers. The Lennard-Jones parameters for the methylene group obtained from cyclic alkanes are transferred to the ethers for each ring size, and those for the oxygen atom are common to all compounds for a given ring size.

It is shown that the electron distribution in the protein-bound 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine differs from that of free 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in buffer. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts indicate that the protein-bound 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine is embedded in a polar environment and that the ring system is strongly polarized. It is concluded that the two carbonyl groups play an important role in the polarization of the molecule. The N(3)-H group is not accessible to bulk solvent. The N(8) atom is sp2 hybridized and has delta+ character. Nuclear Overhauser effect studies indicate that the 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine ring is rigidly bound with no internal mobility.

This compound also serves as a biosynthetic precursor of riboflavin and is the substrate of the enzyme riboflavin synthase. This enzyme and lumazine protein show considerable sequence homology. The interaction of lumazine apoprotein with several trifluoromethyl analogs of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine was investigated by 19F NMR spectroscopy. Upon binding to the protein, the 19F NMR resonances of the ligand shift to lower field with broadened line widths to around 30 Hz. By comparison, all ligands studied show more complex NMR spectra when bound to riboflavin synthase. Only one position 7 epimer (designated epimer A) of 6,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)-7-hydroxy-8-(D-ribityl)lumazine binds to lumazine apoprotein and riboflavin synthase. The apoprotein can also bind lumazine derivatives with a quarternary C-7. It is suggested that the binding site of lumazine protein corresponds to the donor binding site of riboflavin synthase.",

This hypothesis is based on the inability of Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli and S. typhimurium, to uptake riboflavin from the external environment. As Gram-negative bacteria need to produce their own riboflavin, inhibiting riboflavin synthase or other enzymes involved in the pathway may be useful tools in developing antibacterial drugs. The most potent riboflavin synthase inhibitor is 9-D-ribityl-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6,8-trione, with Ki value of 0.61 \u03bcM. 9-D-ribityl-1,3,7-trihydropurine-2,6,8-trione is thought to work through competitive inhibition with 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine.

Other examples include ribityl in 6,7-Dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, and glycosylamines. Alternative substituent groups Instead of the hemiacetal hydroxyl group, a hydrogen atom can be removed to form a substituent, for example the hydrogen from the C3 hydroxyl of a glucose molecule.

It modulates the emission of bacterial luciferase to shorter wavelengths with increasing luminous strength. To obtain structural information on the native structure as well as the interaction with bacterial luciferase, we have determined the crystal structures of LumP from Photobacterium kishitanii in complexes with DMRL and its analogues, riboflavin (RBF) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), at resolutions of 2.00, 1.42, and 2.00 A. LumP consists of two beta barrels that have nearly identical folds, the N-terminal and C-terminal barrels. The structures of LumP in complex with all of the chromophores studied are all essentially identical, except around the chromophores. In all of the structures, the chromophore is tethered to the narrow cavity via many hydrogen bonds in the N-terminal domain. These are absent in the C-terminal domain. Hydrogen bonding in LumP-FMN is decreased in comparison with that in LumP-RBF because the phosphate moiety of FMN protrudes out of the narrow cavity. In LumP-DMRL, the side chain of Gln65 is close to the ring system, and a new water molecule that stabilizes the ligand is observed near Ser48. Therefore, DMRL packs more tightly in the ligand-binding site than RBF or FMN. A docking simulation of bacterial luciferase and LumP suggests that the chromophore is located close enough for direct energy transfer to occur. Moreover, the surface potentials around the ligand-binding sites of LumP and bacterial luciferase exhibit complementary charge distributions, which would have a significant effect on the interaction between LumP and luciferase.",

This intermediate is converted to riboflavin by the alpha subunits via an unusual dismutation. The second product of this reaction is PYR, which is also a substrate of the beta subunits and can be recycled in the catalytic process. Sigmoidal kinetics would be expected for the formation of riboflavin from PYR and DHB and are indeed observed with mixtures of artifactual beta 60 capsids and alpha subunit trimers. In contrast, the formation of riboflavin from PYR and DHB by the native alpha 3 beta 60 is characterized by a finite initial rate, which is similar to the rate of lumazine formation. Most notably, the rate of riboflavin formation has its maximum value at t = 0 and decreases dramatically after the consumption of PYR and DHB despite the presence of transiently formed lumazine. These data suggest that a significant fraction of DHB is converted to riboflavin by substrate channeling, which is conducive to an improved overall catalytic rate of riboflavin formation at low substrate concentrations. The channel is leaky, and the intermediate lumazine is therefore transiently accumulated in the bulk solution. The partitioning factor relating the direct formation of riboflavin via substrate channeling and the formation of transient 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityl-lumazine increases at low concentrations of the substrates PYR and DHB and has a maximum value at pH 7.5.

A van't Hoff analysis of the dissociation constant allows evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters: delta H degrees = 28 kcal/mol and delta S degrees = 67 eu. By analogy to published results on the binding of FMN to apoflavodoxin, the contribution of hydrophobic interaction and of hydrogen bonding to the binding enthalpy can be estimated.

The complex is composed of 3 alpha (riboflavin synthase) subunits and 60 beta (lumazine synthase) subunits and has a relative mass of 1 MDa. The 60 beta subunits are arranged in an icosahedral capsid enclosing the alpha trimer in the central core. The protein was crystallised, and an X-ray structure of the icosahedral capsid was obtained at 3.3 A resolution with a crystallographic R-factor of 0.33. Hollow, icosahedral capsids consisting of 60 beta subunits can be obtained by inhibitor-driven renaturation of isolated beta subunits. They catalyse the formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine at the same rate as the native alpha 3 beta 60 complex and can be crystallised in two different hexagonal and one monoclinic form. Crystallographic intensity data of the monoclinic crystals to a resolution of 2.4 A were obtained using synchrotron radiation and an image plate detector system. The orientation of the icosahedral molecules in the monoclinic cell was deduced by real space vector search procedures from a 3.5 A Patterson map. Phases were calculated from the model of the alpha 3 beta 60 protein and were extended by cyclic averaging exploring the 30-fold redundancy of the electron density. The 2.4 A map allowed us to refine the existing atomic model of lumazine synthase. The refined model includes 154 amino acid residues, one inhibitor molecule, 58 water molecules and one phosphate ion. Applying non-crystallographic-symmetry restraints the crystallographic R-factor is 16.7% for 100,092 reflections between 10 and 2.4 A. The chain folding of the beta subunits is closely similar to the native alpha 3 beta 60 enzyme. The lumazine synthase bears resemblance to the sugar binding proteins. The significantly higher resolution compared to the alpha 3 beta 60 structure determination allows a detailed description of the substrate analogue binding site. The environment of the 5-nitro-6-(D-ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione inhibitor is particularly rigid, and the chain segments involved in forming the active site are highly conserved for lumazine synthases of different species. A residual density feature in the final map is interpreted as a bound phosphate which mimics the binding of the second substrate. We discuss the reaction mechanism on this structural basis.",

In order to synthesize deaza-forms of lumazines, we took inspiration from preparations of lumazine synthase inhibitors where the 5-nitrogen of the non-ribityl lumazine core was replaced with a carbon 20 (Fig. 1a). Specifically, we replaced the 5-nitrogen of the known ribityllumazine ligand 6,7-dimethyl-8-d-ribityllumazine (DMRL) or a monomethyl version of this ligand, 7-methyl-8-d-ribityllumazine, with a carbon to produce the known compounds 6,7-dimethyl-8-d-ribityldeazalumazine (deazalumazine or DZ) and 7-methyl-8-d-ribityldeazalumazine (monomethyl-DZ or mmDZ), respectively (Fig. 1b,c). Additionally, we prepared 2\u2032-deoxy-DZ (dDZ) (Fig. 1d), lacking the 2\u2032-hydroxyl of the ribityl moiety, and a deaza-version of photolumazine I (DZPLI, Fig. 1e), a novel MR1T cell-activating ribityllumazine ligand we recently described 13 . It is worth noting that the original design was to create a 5-deaza version of 5-OP-RU, but this compound spontaneously cyclized during synthesis to produce monomethyl-DZ.",

The homotrimer of 23 kDa subunits has no cofactor requirements for catalysis. The enzyme is nonexistent in humans and is an attractive target for antimicrobial agents of organisms whose pathogenicity depends on their ability to biosynthesize riboflavin. The first three-dimensional structure of the enzyme was determined at 2.0 A resolution using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method on the Escherichia coli protein containing selenomethionine residues. The homotrimer consists of an asymmetric assembly of monomers, each of which comprises two similar beta barrels and a C-terminal alpha helix. The similar beta barrels within the monomer confirm a prediction of pseudo two-fold symmetry that is inferred from the sequence similarity between the two halves of the protein. The beta barrels closely resemble folds found in phthalate dioxygenase reductase and other flavoproteins. The three active sites of the trimer are proposed to lie between pairs of monomers in which residues conserved among species reside, including two Asp-His-Ser triads and dyads of Cys-Ser and His-Thr. The proposed active sites are located where FMN (an analog of riboflavin) is modeled from an overlay of the beta barrels of phthalate dioxygenase reductase and riboflavin synthase. In the trimer, one active site is formed, and the other two active sites are wide open and exposed to solvent. The nature of the trimer configuration suggests that only one active site can be formed and be catalytically competent at a time.",

The largest benefit this technology provides for immunostaining is that it can be conducted in a liquid medium, where methods such as ELISA or Western Blotting require a stationary medium for the desired target to bind to before the secondary antibody (such as HRP [Horse Radish Peroxidase]) is able to be applied. Since MIA can be conducted in a liquid medium a more accurate measurement of desired molecules can be performed in the model system.

In short, PAP is a key player in controlling the overall flux of triacylglycerols to phospholipids and vice versa, also exerting control through the generation and degradation of lipid-signaling molecules related to phosphatidate. When PAP is active, diacylglycerols formed by PAP can go on to form any of several products, including phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, and triacylglycerol. Phospholipids can be formed from diacylglycerol through reaction with activated alcohols, and triacylglycerols can be formed from DAG through reaction with fatty acyl CoA molecules. When PAP is inactive, DGK drives the reaction in reverse, allowing phosphatidate to accumulate as it brings down DAG levels. Phosphatidate can then be converted into an activated form, CDP-DAG, through the liberation of a pyrophosphate from a CTP molecule, or into cardiolipin. CDP-DAG is a principal precursor used by the body in phospholipid",

However, if this fragment is connected to different atom types in distinct parent molecules, all possibilities should be retained. Therefore, this information is deposited as one copy of the fragment representing all possible connections.

For the purpose of a rational approach where features can be interpreted on a chemical basis, we selected attributes that were relevant, but more importantly easily interpretable. This approach is strongly inspired by the so-called 3D-olfactophore, where such easily interpretable features computed on odorants sharing the same olfactory percept are gathered in the 3 dimensions of space. Such features are typically Hydrogen bond donor/acceptor, Aromatic cycle, Charged atom, etc. This methodology is typically useful for molecular scientists to learn about structure- property relationships and design new molecules which fulfill the properties of these olfactophores [28]. Here the features we used were a series of physico-chemical properties. Thus, we selected constitutional, topological and chemical descriptors that represent molecular features which can be easily interpreted and extrapolated for further predictive models. They include the following categories: constitutional indices (n = 29; ex. \"Molecular weight\"), ring descriptors (n = 7; ex. \"Number of rings\"), functional group counts (n = 40; ex. \"Number of esters\"), molecular properties (n = 6; ex. \"Topological polar surface area\"). To select these descriptors, we screened the whole set of descriptors proposed by Dragon. We carefully selected descriptors able to provide information interpretable by any molecular scientist. The cost of selecting interpretable descriptors is a reduction in the description of the dataset. To evaluate the loss of information on the variance of a given molecular dataset, descriptors were computed on a set of 2620 odorants provided by Saito and colleagues [29]. Finally, 347 descriptors remained after filtering the following: correlated (above 0.85), constant for the whole dataset (no variation across parameters), not available for the whole dataset. After the dimensionality reduction, our selected 82 descriptors accounted for 37.2% of the original variance. When choosing randomly 82 descriptors within this set of 347, the variance always falls below 25%, suggesting that our descriptors performed quite well at describing a molecular set with a certain degree of variability. Finally, when projecting the entire set of molecules on to the two first components of a PCA, the dataset remains well split and molecules were still distinguishable.",

The \"ZINC is not commercial\" (ZINC) database, operated by the University of California, is composed of 293 commercially available libraries (35). Alternatively, researchers may develop \"in house\" libraries customized for screening a given target. Focused libraries, small subsections of molecules that contain desired functional groups or qualities, can be created to screen select targets. Virtual fragment screening techniques can be employed to filter libraries (36). Table 2 lists several libraries that can be used for fragment-based VS. These collections were chosen for their accessibility to be screened by a researcher, rather than collections that could be screened by third party companies. The fragment library used at Vernalis was originally composed of vendor catalogs (37). The original 2004 library was designed to be a general-purpose library that could be screened by a variety of targets. Increased emphasis on chemical diversity was placed on the construction of the library, and a molecular fingerprinting method based on 2D three-point pharmacophores was used to assess the diversity. Many compounds were removed from the original library after screening and quality control, replaced with more complex fragments that carried more desirable characteristics. This evolution was considered an essential process to keep up with new project demands and the availability of new information on the desired targets (37). The 3D Fragment Consortium, a collaboration of non-profit drug discovery groups based in the United Kingdom, argues that traditional fragment libraries often contain limited shape diversity, possibly explaining why some target sites are troublesome for trying to identify hit compounds. The consortium is creating a chemical library consisting of fragments that have \"greater three dimensionality\" that explore the chemical space, as opposed to planar, rigid fragments. While the increased complexity of 3D compounds could potentially lower hit compound numbers, the group is hopeful that the resulting leads will explore more biologically relevant chemical space and lead to better starting molecules for drug design (38).\n\n\nRecent FBDD Strategies",

For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia. After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.

In animals, free radical nitric oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation. Nitric oxide's rapid reaction with water in animals results in the production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in the excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in the excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.",

The name \"aspartic acid\" can refer to either enantiomer or a mixture of two. Of these two forms, only one, \"L-aspartic acid\", is directly incorporated into proteins. The biological roles of its counterpart, \"D-aspartic acid\" are more limited. Where enzymatic synthesis will produce one or the other, most chemical syntheses will produce both forms, \"DL-aspartic acid\", known as a racemic mixture. Synthesis Biosynthesis In the human body, aspartate is most frequently synthesized through the transamination of oxaloacetate. The biosynthesis of aspartate is facilitated by an aminotransferase enzyme: the transfer of an amine group from another molecule such as alanine or glutamine yields aspartate and an alpha-keto acid. Aspartate also plays an important role in the urea cycle. Chemical synthesis Industrially, aspartate is produced by amination of fumarate catalyzed by L-aspartate ammonia-lyase.",

Dalton also proposed a modern atomic theory in 1803 which stated that all matter was composed of small indivisible particles termed atoms, atoms of a given element possess unique characteristics and weight, and three types of atoms exist: simple (elements), compound (simple molecules), and complex (complex molecules). In 1808, Dalton first published New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808-1827), in which he outlined the first modern scientific description of the atomic theory.

The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work.

The simplest case is a pair of water molecules with one hydrogen bond between them, which is called the water dimer and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the crystal structure of ice, helping to create an open hexagonal lattice.

One of the ways to learn about an interaction between two molecules is to determine the binding constant, which is a number that describes the ratio of unbound and bound molecules. This information reveals the affinity between the two molecules and allows prediction of the amount bound given any set of initial conditions. In order to measure a binding constant, one must find a way to measure the amount of complex formed over a range of starting concentrations. This can be achieved by \"labeling\" one of the species with a fluorescent, or in this case, a radioactive tag. The DNA is \"labeled\" by the addition of radioactive phosphate derived from adenosine triphosphate. Description",

Naming information is summarised by IUPAC: \"Phane nomenclature is a new method for building names for organic structures by assembling names that describe component parts of a complex structure. It is based on the idea that a relatively simple skeleton for a parent hydride can be modified by an operation called 'amplification', a process that replaces one or more special atoms (superatoms) of a simplified skeleton by multiatomic structures\".",

The ethanolic and aqueous extracts (250 and 500 mg\u00b7kg(-1) body weight) of the leaves of B. acutangula were assessed for antidiabetic activity in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes animal model following 21 days of treatment. Glibenclamide (0.6 mg\u00b7kg(-1) p.o.) was used as a positive control. The hematological parameters, such as blood glucose level, urea, creatinin, cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels were examined. An acute toxicity study (5 000 mg\u00b7kg(-1), p.o.) did not produce any symptoms of toxicity. Significant reductions in blood glucose level, and serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were noted in animals treated with the extract. The high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLC) level was found to increase as compared with the diabetic control group. These results suggest that the leaf aqueous and ethanolic extracts of B. acutangula have anti-diabetic effects. The aqueous extract of B. acutangula produced a similar effect when compared with the ethanol extract. It is proposed that consumption of B. acutangula in some form like tea may help the management of diabetes.",

A readily available chiral starting material is manipulated through successive reactions, often using achiral reagents, to obtain the desired target molecule. This can meet the criteria for enantioselective synthesis when a new chiral species is created, such as in an SN2 reaction. Chiral pool synthesis is especially attractive for target molecules having similar chirality to a relatively inexpensive naturally occurring building-block such as a sugar or amino acid. However, the number of possible reactions the molecule can undergo is restricted and tortuous synthetic routes may be required (e.g. Oseltamivir total synthesis). This approach also requires a stoichiometric amount of the enantiopure starting material, which can be expensive if it is not naturally occurring.",

This approach takes advantage of RNA's dual nature as both a catalyst and an informational polymer, making it easy for an investigator to produce vast populations of RNA catalysts using polymerase enzymes. The ribozymes are mutated by reverse transcribing them with reverse transcriptase into various cDNA and amplified with error-prone PCR. The selection parameters in these experiments often differ. One approach for selecting a ligase ribozyme involves using biotin tags, which are covalently linked to the substrate. If a molecule possesses the desired ligase activity, a streptavidin matrix can be used to recover the active molecules.",

The present study deals with a detailed pharmacognostical study on the leaf of the crude drug, B. acutangula. Morphoanatomy of the leaf was studied using light and confocal microscopy and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on quality control methods for medicinal plant materials. Literature reveals that the phytoconstituents like tanginol, barrinic acid, and barringenic acid are present in the wood and fruits of this plant. Our preliminary phytochemical studies of the powdered leaves revealed the presence of terpenes, flavanoids, carbohydrates, tannins, steroids, and glycosides. The physico-chemical, morphological, histological parameters, and High Performance-Thin Layer Chromatographic (HPTLC) profile presented in this paper may be proposed as parameters to establish the authenticity of B. acutangula and can possibly help to differentiate the drug from its other species and the pharmacognostic profile of the leaves presented here will assist in standardization viz., quality, purity, and sample identification.",

This generation tool can be combined with workflows for the screening of large numbers of molecules on the basis of computed molecular properties that fulfill certain criteria. We applied such a workflow to find molecules with potential to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs, using desirable optical properties as selection criteria. Results are shown for NDI's, PDI's, PTI1's, and PTI2's derivatives. The derivatives create a very diverse set of chromophores allowing panchromatic sensitization of the photoelectrode if adsorbed together on a semiconductor surface. The outcome is around 1400 derivatives that fulfill the criteria to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs. The workflow applied to NDI selects already known sensitizers out of 1015 structures, which shows its reliability. We also considered estimating the GSOP and ESOP by HOMO/ LUMO energy levels but observed that this simple procedure based on DFT(CAM-B3LYP) values is not predictive enough for this purpose. The CAT code is available as an open source and is thereby extendable to other applications, where systematic screening of compound derivatives is needed, like in the discovery of new photoswitches or in the discovery of new water oxidation catalysts. \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research has been financially supported by the NWO Solar to Products program (project number 733.000.007).

An example of such repositories is PubChem [1][2][3][4][5], developed and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM). PubChem consists of three primary databases: Substance, Compound, and BioAssay. As of May 2016, 416 PubChem data contributors provide a wide range of chemical substance descriptions to the PubChem Substance database (accession: SID). The set of unique chemical structures present in the Substance database make up the PubChem Compound database (accession: CID). Results from biological experiments performed on the substance samples are stored in the PubChem BioAssay database (accession: AID). Altogether, PubChem is a sizeable data system of more than 219 million substance descriptions, 89 million unique chemical structures, one million biological assays, and 230 million biological assay outcomes (where an outcome is the set of results from a substance being tested in an assay).\n\nThere is a large variation in the amount of information available for each molecule contained in PubChem. For example, whereas some molecules have enormous quantities of information on the biological activity and literature associated, other molecules have very little information other than the chemical structure. When there is no desired information available for a particular molecule, one may infer it from its structural analogues that have relevant information. Even when a molecule has desired information, comparison with other available information on the molecule and its structural analogues may provide additional important insight.",

To investigate the antinociceptive, antidiarrheal, and neuropharmacological effect of the methanol extract of B. acutangula leaves and seeds in mice. The extracts (200 and 400 mg/kg; p.o.) were tested for antinociceptive activity by acetic acid-induced writhing, hot plate and tail immersion models; castor oil- and magnesium sulphate-induced diarrheal models were used to evaluate antidiarrheal activity whereas hole cross and open field models were employed for testing neuropharmacological activity. Both extracts exhibited significant antinociceptive effect (p &lt; 0.001) in acetic acid and heat induced pain models in a dose-dependent manner. The extracts prolonged the latency period to the thermal stimuli in both hot plate and tail immersion test. The extracts also showed significant inhibition of defecation (p &lt; 0.001, 0.01) in both diarrheal models. Again, the spontaneous motor activity was decreased (p &lt; 0.001) by the extracts in both hole cross and open field test.

The oligosaccharides in the hydrolysate were fractionated using size-exclusion, anion exchange and activated carbon chromatography. The primary sequence of the purified oligomers was determined by two-dimensional NMR techniques. The T. reesei mannanase cleaves the beta-1,4-glycosidic linkage of D-mannosyl residues attached either to D-mannose or D-glucose. The D-mannosyl residue may also be substituted by a D-galactosyl group. The main disaccharide produced was mannobiose, but a significant amount of 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose (GlcMan) was also produced. After extensive hydrolysis the main trisaccharides produced were 4-O-beta-D-mannopyranosyl-[6-O-alpha-galactopyranosyl]-D-mannopyranose (Gal1Man2) and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose (Glc2Man). Some mannotriose 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D-mannopyra-nosyl-D-manno pyranose (GlcMan2) and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-[6-O-alpha-galactopyranosyl]-D-mannopyranose (Gal1GlcMan) were also detected in the hydrolysate. The structures of two tetrasaccharides were studied. They appeared to be 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D- glucopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose (Glc3Man) and 4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D-mannopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D -glucopyranosyl-D-mannopyranose (GlcManGlcMan). According to the results obtained, the galactoglucomannan in pine contains regions in which two or three glucose units are linked together, which further means that it may contain regions with several successive mannose residues. The galactose side groups were found to be attached only to mannose.",

One of the ways to learn about an interaction between two molecules is to determine the binding constant, which is a number that describes the ratio of unbound and bound molecules. This information reveals the affinity between the two molecules and allows prediction of the amount bound given any set of initial conditions. In order to measure a binding constant, one must find a way to measure the amount of complex formed over a range of starting concentrations. This can be achieved by \"labeling\" one of the species with a fluorescent, or in this case, a radioactive tag.

Both inhabit particularly valuable remnants of oak-hornbeam forests in Europe, but tend toward a specific kind of vicariance on a local scale. The present study was undertaken to determine habitat factors responsible for this phenomenon and verify the indicative and conservation value of these lichens. The main spatial and climatic parameters that, along with forest structure, potentially affect their distribution patterns and abundance were analysed in four complexes with typical oak-hornbeam stands in NE Poland. Fifty plots of 400\u2009m<sup2</sup each were chosen for detailed examination of stand structure and epiphytic lichens directly associated with the indicators. The study showed that the localities of the two species barely overlap within the same forest community in a relatively small geographical area. The occurrence of Chrysothrix candelaris depends basically only on microhabitat space provided by old oaks and its role as an indicator of the ecological continuity of habitat is limited. Varicellaria hemisphaerica is not tree specific but a sufficiently high moisture of habitat is essential for the species and it requires forests with high proportion of deciduous trees in a wide landscape scale. Local landscape-level habitat continuity is more important for this species than the current age of forest stand. Regardless of the indicative value, localities of both lichens within oak-hornbeam forests deserve the special protection status since they form unique assemblages of exclusive epiphytes, including those with high conservation value.",

The process begins by producing 7-chloroindole-3-acetamide by treating 7-chloroindole with a series of reagents, shown farther down. This molecule is then glycosylated and reacted with methyl 7-chloroindole-3-glyoxylate to produce an intermediate that goes on to stabilize into the final product. While this process is one of the better ones to date, it is still work and time intensive, going through 12 total steps and only yielding 12%. Further developments",

The chirality present in the auxiliary can bias the stereoselectivity of one or more subsequent reactions. The auxiliary can then be typically recovered for future use. Most biological molecules and pharmaceutical targets exist as one of two possible enantiomers; consequently, chemical syntheses of natural products and pharmaceutical agents are frequently designed to obtain the target in enantiomerically pure form.

Omidenepag isopropyl is quickly metabolized to its active metabolite, omidenepag, a molecule with high selectivity and agonistic activity towards the prostaglandin E2 (EP2) receptor. Prostanoid FP receptor agonists (FP agonists), such as [latanoprost], are part of the first-line therapy for ocular hypertension and primary open-angle glaucoma; however, not all patients achieve adequate IOP reduction with FP agonists and require changes in treatment. The use of an EP2 receptor agonist such as omidenepag represents an alternative in these scenarios. Omidenepag IOP-lowering effect is comparable to the one observed with [latanoprost]. In 2018, omidenepag isopropyl was approved in Japan for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. In September 2022, the FDA approved the use of omidenepag isopropyl.']",

Here, we demonstrate that axenic hairy root cultures of two tribe Anthocercideae species, Cyphanthera tasmanica Miers and Anthocercis ilicifolia ssp. ilicifolia Hook, contain considerable amounts of both nicotine and nornicotine (~0.5-1% DW), together with lower levels of the tropane alkaloid hyoscyamine (&lt;0.2% DW). Treatment of growing hairy roots of both species with micromolar levels of the wound stress hormone methyl-jasmonate (MeJa) led to significant increases (P&lt;0.05) in pyridine alkaloid concentrations but not of hyoscyamine. Consistent with previous studies involving Nicotiana species, we also observed that transcript levels of key genes required for pyridine alkaloid synthesis increased in hairy roots of both Anthocercideae species following MeJa treatment. We hypothesise that wound-associated induction of pyridine alkaloid synthesis in extant species of tribe Anthocercideae and genus Nicotiana was a feature of common ancestral stock that existed before the separation of both lineages ~15million years ago.",

It was approved by the FDA on March 26, 2019 and by Health Canada on February 20, 2020. This drug is considered a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and is thought to play a role in suppressing the central nervous system inflammation that is associated with MS.  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that is chronic and inflammatory, disrupting communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Most patients diagnosed with this illness experience their initial disease symptoms between the age of 20 to 40, often the most productive years of life. Symptoms may include but are not limited to fatigue, gait changes, bowel or bladder dysfunction, abnormal muscle twitching, vision disturbance, and depressing or mood swings. MS is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults and is found to occur more frequently in women than in men.']",

A Diels-Alder strategy comprising trapping of the transient exocyclic diene 19, which is derived from 18, with 1,4-naphthoquinone leads to the aromatised TTFAQ anthraquinone system 21. Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination of 21 with the anion generated from reagent 22 gave the fused bis(TTFAQ) structure 23. Pyrrolo-annelated derivatives 30-34 have been obtained in a sequence of reactions from compound 10. Mono-formylation of the pyrrole ring of 32 and 33 under Vilsmeier conditions gave 35 and 36 which upon reaction with 2,4,5,7-tetranitrofluorene gave the donor-pi-acceptor diads 38 and 39. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in solution for all the TTFAQ derivatives shows the typical quasi-reversible two-electron oxidation wave of the TTFAQ core at potentials which vary slightly depending on the substituents. For example, the value of Eox is raised by the electron withdrawing anthraquinone and tetranitrofluorene units of 21 and 38, respectively. The CV of the conjugated TTFAQ dimer 23 showed two, two-electron oxidation waves corresponding to the sequential formation of 23(2+) and 23(4+) (delta Eox = 130 mV) providing evidence for a significant intramolecular electronic interaction, i.e. the dication 23(2+) acts as a conjugated donor-pi-acceptor diad, thereby raising the oxidation potential of its partner TTFAQ unit. Spectroelectrochemical studies on 23 support this explanation. A strong intramolecular charge transfer band at lambda max 538 nm is seen in the UV-Vis spectra of the TTFAQ-pi-tetranitrofluorene diads 38 and 39. The X-ray crystal structures are reported for compounds 30, 33 and 34. The pyrrolo-TTFAQ moiety adopts a saddle-shape with the central ring of the dihydroanthracene moiety folded along the C(9) ... C(10) vector in each case. Significant intermolecular interactions are observed in the structures.",

Discovery of natural products that inhibit cell cycle progression significantly contributes to the progress of cancer biology and the development of new antitumor agents. In this study, cell cycle inhibitory activity was evaluated with our extract library of natural resources, including marine invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria, using HeLa/Fucci2 cells which allow classification of the cell cycle phases of living cells. Screening of the extract library revealed that the extract of the marine sponge Dactylospongia metachromia inhibited cell cycle progression at S/G2/M phases. Bioassay-guided fractionation afforded a new sesquiterpene quinone, neoisosmenospongine (1), and four known compounds, nakijiquinone I, N, and Q (2-4) and (-)-dictyoceratin-C (5). The chemical structure of 1 was elucidated by interpretating the NMR and mass spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined by comparison of the experimental and calculated ECD spectra. Fluorescent imaging of HeLa/Fucci2 cells revealed that 1-4 inhibited the cell cycle progression at S/G2/M phases. This study demonstrated that fluorescent image-based high-content screening using HeLa/Fucci2 cells is an effective approach for isolating cell cycle inhibitors from natural resources.",

The key to the process is the enzyme chalcone synthase (CHS), which catalyzes the formation of a hydroxyl chalcone from three molecules of malonyl-CoA and one molecule cinnamoyl-CoA. Functioning as intermediates of the subsequent biosynthesis of flavonoids, hydroxyl chalcones are not chemically stable and quickly isomerize to flavanones. However, some plants are capable of accumulating hydroxyaurones, formed by the enzyme aurone synthase (AUS). In the presence of the enzyme chalcone reductase (CHR) and NADPH as a co-factor, the oxygen function of the polyketide intermediate is reduced and eliminated as water prior to cyclization, resulting in the formation of 6\u2019-deoxychalcones.

The major odor notes of B and C can be clearly determined, and their primary notes are quite frequent in the odorant descriptions of a large database. The \"B\" and \"C\" odors are not directly connected in a network of numerous odor notes but have numerous common links; \u2022\n\nThe molecules sharing the \"A\" odor have diverse chemical structures, with some comparable to those of B or C molecules. The \"A\" odor is uncommon among odorants. This odor is frequently present in odor descriptions, but never alone in any description, with the odors of B and C being its most frequent associations; \u2022 Despite the differences and structural variations in the molecules carrying the odors of A, B or C, the spatial distribution of their chemical features meets the same distance criteria.

Thereby, most compounds with suitable pro\ue103les were classi\ue103ed into one of the groups. The number of the group is associated with the priority for acquisition and testing. Table 3 summarizes the group classi\ue103cation strategy and the number of compounds that were classi\ue103ed into each group. A further description of each group is presented below.\n\nGroup 1 includes commercially available compounds that meet our safety criteria (based on the predictions of Swis-sADME), i.e., they do not have PAINS alerts, do not pass through the BBB, and do not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4. The molecules in this group are predicted to form hydrogen bonds with at least one of the catalytic residues of PDB ID 6LU7.

They can meet our safety criteria and do not form hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues. Else, they can form hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues but do not meet our safety criteria.\n\nGroup 3 consists of 34 molecules that are not commercially available but meet the safety criteria and form hydrogen bonds with at least one of the catalytic residues.

The former includes physical and chemical properties from wet-lab experiments recorded in molecule KBs in the form of natural language. The latter includes the chemical bond, molecular ring and aromaticity information, and this helps the spatial structure information reflected in the SMILES expression become more intuitive. Given the chemical SMILES following the task prefixes, our model is trained to generate the natural language answers constructed with the above information.\n\nOur main contributions are as followed: (1) We propose conversational molecular design, an innovative task adopting natural language as the basic medium of human-machine interaction for conducting low-barrier molecular discovery; (2) We provide ChatMol, which is a pre-trained model that can perform well in the new task with the enhancement of molecular knowledge and chemical-natural language associations; (3) Experiment results prove the challenge of the task we propose and also the effectiveness of our method, achieving better performance with much fewer pre-training steps.\n\n\nConversational Molecular Design\n\nIn this section, we clarify the definition and related settings of the newly proposed task.\n\n\nTask Definition\n\nIn each turn of the molecular design, both the human user and the intelligent system may provide molecules expressed in chemical language or chemical properties expressed in natural language.

Rather, the molecule exhibits bond lengths in between those of single and double bonds.

These radiotracers generally fall into two main categories\u2014labeled molecules normally used in the body such as water or glucose or labeled molecules that react with or bind to receptors within the body. One important application in the latter class is the attachment of the molecule to a biologically active proteins and peptides, including antibodies and antibody fragments.

This generation tool can be combined with workflows for the screening of large numbers of molecules on the basis of computed molecular properties that fulfill certain criteria. We applied such a workflow to find molecules with potential to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs, using desirable optical properties as selection criteria. Results are shown for NDI's, PDI's, PTI1's, and PTI2's derivatives. The derivatives create a very diverse set of chromophores allowing panchromatic sensitization of the photoelectrode if adsorbed together on a semiconductor surface. The outcome is around 1400 derivatives that fulfill the criteria to be used as photosensitizers in DS-PECs. The workflow applied to NDI selects already known sensitizers out of 1015 structures, which shows its reliability. We also considered estimating the GSOP and ESOP by HOMO/ LUMO energy levels but observed that this simple procedure based on DFT(CAM-B3LYP) values is not predictive enough for this purpose. The CAT code is available as an open source and is thereby extendable to other applications, where systematic screening of compound derivatives is needed, like in the discovery of new photoswitches or in the discovery of new water oxidation catalysts. \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research has been financially supported by the NWO Solar to Products program (project number 733.000.007).

An example of such repositories is PubChem [1][2][3][4][5], developed and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM). PubChem consists of three primary databases: Substance, Compound, and BioAssay. As of May 2016, 416 PubChem data contributors provide a wide range of chemical substance descriptions to the PubChem Substance database (accession: SID). The set of unique chemical structures present in the Substance database make up the PubChem Compound database (accession: CID). Results from biological experiments performed on the substance samples are stored in the PubChem BioAssay database (accession: AID). Altogether, PubChem is a sizeable data system of more than 219 million substance descriptions, 89 million unique chemical structures, one million biological assays, and 230 million biological assay outcomes (where an outcome is the set of results from a substance being tested in an assay).\n\nThere is a large variation in the amount of information available for each molecule contained in PubChem. For example, whereas some molecules have enormous quantities of information on the biological activity and literature associated, other molecules have very little information other than the chemical structure. When there is no desired information available for a particular molecule, one may infer it from its structural analogues that have relevant information. Even when a molecule has desired information, comparison with other available information on the molecule and its structural analogues may provide additional important insight.",

While the notion of extracting molecules from literature is by no means a novel task, most methods rely on handcrafted rules and built on the intuitions of chemists [14]. There are essentially two main tasks to extract visual information from chemistry literature: segmentation and molecule prediction. Segmentation systems are focused on segmenting parts of the chemistry documents and inferring what the pixel coordinates of a molecule or reaction may be. Molecule prediction systems focus on extracting the output of segmentation systems and predicting the most likely molecule for each given molecule segment found in the target document. In segmentation, a system processes a chemistry paper and produces a list of X and Y pixel coordinates representing locations where molecules and reactions are present in a paper. Description generation systems leverage the segmented images to predict a molecule description in the form of a SMILES string. As we find segmentation software to be very effective, our work focuses on molecule prediction. Despite no large dataset of annotations, molecule prediction is a perfect candidate for data-hungry solutions because artificial datasets are relatively easy to create. Software tools such as RDKIT [1] can use SMILES strings to create images of molecules varying style, shape, and size (pixels) at scale. While RDKIT leverages the deterministic natures of SMILES strings to create identical molecule structures each time, it can vary stylistic components such as rotation, bond highlighting, and molecule numbering to produce multiple representations of the same molecule. Independently of chemistry, in the last few years computer science researchers have been able to use large data regimes and neural network architecture like transformers [47] and convolutional networks [15] [52]. Image captioning has been able to leverage findings in computer vision and natural language processing to build systems which can provide descriptive, accurate, captions at an incredibly fast pace. Xu et. Al's [52] architecture of using a computer vision focused Convolutions Neural Network for feature extraction and using those features with a task-specific decoder has proven to be scalable and tune-able. Recently, some of these approaches have begun to be applied in chemistry [38], and while these approaches have provided strong starting points, their application to chemistry is neither tuned for chemistry nor leveraging the most advanced architectures in feature extraction nor description generation. The lack of task-specific architecture modifications causes accuracy to suffer and cannot outperform traditional handcrafted systems like OSRA. This paper introduces IMG2SMI, a",

The deal included SCE owning the intellectual property and that LittleBigPlanet would be available only on PlayStation consoles. Evans said, \"SCE have proven to be the perfect partner for us. They immediately understood both our ambition for the game as well as our development style.\" Pre-production was extended until August when Media Molecule met with Sony executives, including Harrison, to decide whether to greenlight the game's production. Harrison described the pitch for production as the best meeting he had ever had. Media Molecule then started full development. In 2019, Harrison reaffirmed this sentiment, citing Evan's different approach. Instead of using PowerPoint, he wrote his own interactive 'PowerPoint' so that the game was playable through the presentation. Harrison said this demonstrated",

A proposed pathway converts squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene via the action of squalene epoxidase, at which point dammaranes can be synthesized through dammarenediol synthase, oleananes through beta-amyrin synthase, and another class of molecules, the phytosterols, through cycloartenol synthase. In the proposed pathway, squalene is synthesized from the assembly of two farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) molecules. Each molecule of FPP is in turn the product of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate and two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). IPP is produced by the mevalonic pathway in the cytosol of a ginseng plant cell and by the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in the plant's plastid.",

The economical benefit of biocomputers lies in this potential of all biologically derived systems to self-replicate and self-assemble given appropriate conditions. For instance, all of the necessary proteins for a certain biochemical pathway, which could be modified to serve as a biocomputer, could be synthesized many times over inside a biological cell from a single DNA molecule. This DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over. This characteristic of biological molecules could make their production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive. Whereas electronic computers require manual production, biocomputers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them.",

To achieve this, the terminal 5' phosphate requires removal, which is done with the aid of a phosphatase enzyme. The enzyme guanosyl transferase then catalyses the reaction, which produces the diphosphate 5' end. The diphosphate 5' end then attacks the alpha phosphorus atom of a GTP molecule in order to add the guanine residue in a 5'5' triphosphate link. The enzyme (guanine-N7-)-methyltransferase (\"cap MTase\") transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine to the guanine ring. This type of cap, with just the (m7G) in position is called a cap 0 structure. The ribose of the adjacent nucleotide may also be methylated to give a cap 1. Methylation of nucleotides downstream of the RNA molecule produce cap 2, cap 3 structures and so on. In these cases the methyl groups are added to the 2' OH groups of the ribose sugar.",

While cytosolic sulfotransferases play a metabolic role by modifying small molecule substrates such as steroids, flavonoids, neurotransmitters, and phenols, carbohydrate sulfotransferases have a fundamental role in extracellular signalling and adhesion by generating unique ligands through the modification of carbohydrate scaffolds. Since the substrates of carbohydrate sulfotransferases are larger, they have larger active sites than cytosolic sulfotransferases.",

After separation from glucose, galactose travels to the liver for conversion to glucose. Galactokinase uses one molecule of ATP to phosphorylate galactose. The phosphorylated galactose is then converted to glucose-1-phosphate, and then eventually glucose-6-phosphate, which can be broken down in glycolysis. Energy production Many steps of carbohydrate metabolism allow the cells to access energy and store it more transiently in ATP. The cofactors NAD+ and FAD are sometimes reduced during this process to form NADH and FADH2, which drive the creation of ATP in other processes. A molecule of NADH can produce 1.5\u20132.5 molecules of ATP, whereas a molecule of FADH2 yields 1.5 molecules of ATP.",

A value above 1.0 cannot be attributed to the substrate metabolism, but rather to the aforementioned factors regarding bicarbonate buffering. Calculation of RER is commonly done in conjunction with exercise tests such as the VO2 max test. This can be used as an indicator that the participants are nearing exhaustion and the limits of their cardio-respiratory system. An RER greater than or equal to 1.0 is often used as a secondary endpoint criterion of a VO2 max test.

Identifying the location and nature of glycosylations is technically challenging, in addition to the challenge of linking them to functions. Gloster has applied inhibitors to gain more understanding about exactly how they work, including describing a new class of glycosyltransferase inhibitors.

It was discovered that the key constituent of this molecule was a nitrobenzene ring, which was something the lab had already had prior experience with. Rebstock had found a way to fully synthesize this antibiotic around November 1947. This was a rare case where the synthetization of a molecule was more cost effective than fermenting it through organic processes. The team published their work in 1949. Because of the availability of chloromycetin after Rebstock's work, it was abundantly used to treat Rocky Mountain fever and Typhoid fever, and is still used today as a secondary course of action for extreme cases of meningitis, cholera, and other infectious bacterial diseases.

The molecules in this group are predicted to form hydrogen bonds with at least one of the catalytic residues of PDB ID 6LU7.

Such a large (ideally exhaustive) collection of polymers would be particularly powerful in conjunction with machine learning and numerical simulation techniques, as a way to facilitate complicated tasks like human-guided molecular exploration [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] , property prediction [13][14][15][16][17] , and retro-synthesis [18,19] . Computational approaches based on chemical representations and generated data [20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27] have also tremendously reduced the time, cost, and resources spent on physical synthesis in the chemistry lab [28][29][30][31] .\n\nIdeally, a chemical design model would include three components: (1) a well-defined representation capable of capturing known structures, (2) a generative model capable of enumerating all structures in a given class, and (3) an inverse modeling procedure capable of translating known molecular structures into the representation. For a given class of molecules, an ideal chemical design model should satisfy the following five criteria: i. Complete: representation is able to encode all possible structures in the given class. ii. Explicit: representation directly specifies the molecular structure. iii. Valid: every generated output is a physically valid chemical structure in the given class. iv. Explainable: the generation process is understandable to the user. v. Invertible: the inverse procedure can translate molecular structures into the given representation. However, designing a chemical model that meets all these criteria is challenging, especially for structurally complex molecules. Most existing approaches are limited to small, simple chemical structures [32][33][34][35][36] . Even with this limited scope, the design is labor intensive: the representation language is typically developed first, then extended for generation and inverse modeling. In particular, there have been many systems for molecular line notations [32,33] and fragment-level description [34,35] , which were then used as the basis for generative and inverse schemes [5][6][7][8] .",

Thus, three different prototype shapes for the respective Lewis acid and Lewis base were considered, leading to \ue103ve designs for the correction volume V corr (Fig. 8, for a mathematical description see the ESI \u2020). Prototype I comprises cone-shaped molecules, BMe 3 as an example for a Lewis acid and PMe 3 as an example for a Lewis base. When two prototype I molecules are combined into a Lewis acid/base pair, V corr is approximated using the volume of a segment V seg of sphere S (design 1). Prototype II con\ue104ates fan-like and more bulky molecules such as NHCs or PF 5 . For the combination of two prototype II molecules V corr is approximated using the volume of a biconvex lens V bcl (design 2). Design 3 is suitable for the combination of a prototype I molecule and a prototype II molecule, e.g. BMe 3 and a NHC, with V corr being a convex lens V cl (design 3). Prototype III molecules are sterically overcrowded and thus have a % V Bur of more than 50%. Examination of a combination of a prototype I and a prototype III molecule leads to an approximation of V corr as a half-segment V hseg (design 4). For the pair of a prototype II and a prototype III molecule, the volume of a half-biconvex lens V hbcl (design 5) should be applied as correction volume (Fig. 8). To take into account that prototype III molecules extend into the hemisphere of the potential adduct partner when their %V bur exceeds 50%, an empirical correction was introduced for the correction volumes V corr of design 4 V hseg and design 5 V hbcl (for details including the mathematical description of the \ue103ve designs see the ESI \u2020). The distance h between the different types of correction volumes was estimated to be d/2 (Fig. 8). This estimation gives very accurate results, as outlined below. In principle, the combination of a prototype III Lewis base with a prototype III Lewis acid is possible.

The results highlight several key characteristics of the odorants, revealing peculiar links between the odors STR, CAR and PNA, as well as specific chemical properties associated with each subset of odorants, who additionally have common spatial distributions for several chemical features.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nOdorants, Odor Descriptions Involved in the Mixture and Data Organization\n\nWe selected molecules from a large database, previously used to identify links between odor notes and odorants by multivariate statistical analysis [28]. This database, called FB-3508, includes 3508 odorants and 251 odor notes as a binary matrix and was built from the 9th version of the commercially available Flavor-Base [33]. The selection of the molecules was based on the occurrence of the simple odor notes \"strawberry\" (STR), \"caramellic\" (CAR) and \"pineapple\" (PNA) in their odor description. \"Simple odor\" notes are distinct from complex odors based on \"strawberry\" and \"pineapple\". For example, molecules described as \"cooked/jammy strawberry/pineapple\" possess specific aromas that differ from those of fresh fruits. Thus, we have chosen not to consider such complex odor notes as STR or PNA.\n\nAdditionally, we included two molecules that do not strictly meet the selection criteria:\n\n\u2022 Et-iB was included, since this molecule is one component of the target blending mixture. It is not described by \"strawberry\" in Flavor-Base (\"sweet, ethereal, fruity rum like odor and taste; apple notes\"), but is in other databases (e.g., FlavorDB \"rubber, alcoholic, ethereal, strawberry, sweet, fusel, fruity, rummy\" [34]); \u2022 Strawberry furanone, described as \"fruity, caramelized pineapple-strawberry odor & taste; roasted\" was included because this molecule is a key contributor to the aroma of strawberry [35].",

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the quality of single-case experimental design research on the use of high-tech AAC to teach social-communication skills to individuals with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities who have complex communication needs, to determine if this intervention approach meets the criteria for evidence-based practices as outlined by the What Works Clearinghouse. Additionally, information on the following extended methodological standards is reported on all included studies: participant description, description of setting and materials, interventionist description, baseline and intervention description, maintenance, generalization, procedural integrity, and social validity. The results from 18 multiple-baseline or multiple-probe experiments across 17 studies indicate that using high-tech AAC to teach social-communication skills to individuals with autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disabilities and complex communication needs can be considered an evidence-based practice, although the review of comparison (i.e., alternating treatment) design studies did not indicate that high-tech AAC is significantly better than low-tech AAC.",

The linchpin idea behind this successful theory is the description of an in principle exact electron density using a set of fictitiously noninteracting electrons, the occupied KS-orbitals. The associated well-known challenges with this approach are several. For example, a self-interaction error arises as a consequence of describing the total energy as a nonexact functional of the electron density, 1 and corresponds to the unphysical interactions of electrons with themselves. Self-interaction is related to more general delocalization and static correlation errors, 2 which, together with incorrect asymptotic behaviors of exchange-correlation (XC) potentials, 3 are important limitations of DFT. A clear physical interpretation of orbital energies is also missing in DFT. 4 It is only the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy that allows for an interpretation via Janak's theorem, 5 as a sudden photoionization excitation energy (the first IP). 6 Resolution of the frontier-orbital energy problem (getting the first IP right) is in practice linked to a correct functional description of the derivative discontinuity and fractionalparticle occupations 7 as well as to the gap renormalization at the molecular-metal interfaces. 8 Significant advances have been made in these directions through, for example, the development of screened and range-separated hybrid XC-functionals. 9\u221213 Impressive agreements with semiconductor band gaps 14\u221216 and low-order experimental IPs of molecules 8,17 are possible in a generalized Kohn\u2212Sham (GKS), range-separatedhybrid 13,16,18\u221221 framework. In this work, we present a DFT determination of the average electron energy, \u03c7 \u0305 . We then point to the use of \u03c7 \u0305 as a design criteria and quality indicator for density functional approx-imations. The DFT-based theory we outline is formally exact and does not directly relate to individual photoionization processes nor orbital energies, as is discussed in Appendix A. Our evaluation of \u03c7 \u0305 quantifies the average energy of all electrons in the unperturbed electronic ground state. To explain our KS-orbital-energy-free evaluation of electrons, we first take a step back or away from DFT.\n\n\n\u25a0 THEORETICAL BASIS",

Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular.

A proposed pathway converts squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene via the action of squalene epoxidase, at which point dammaranes can be synthesized through dammarenediol synthase, oleananes through beta-amyrin synthase, and another class of molecules, the phytosterols, through cycloartenol synthase. In the proposed pathway, squalene is synthesized from the assembly of two farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) molecules. Each molecule of FPP is in turn the product of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate and two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).

The number of protein molecules synthesized using a given mRNA molecule as a template is highly dependent on translation-initiation features of the mRNA sequence; in particular, the ability of the translation initiation sequence is a key determinant in the recruiting of ribosomes for protein translation.

In 2012, he discovered a high yield pathway to synthesize p-xylene from glucose; this molecule is the key ingredient in polyethylene terephthalate plastic. This process technology utilized a new class of weak acid zeolites that permits the manufacture of biorenewable polyester. In 2015, Dauenhauer and his team developed a new class of surfactants, detergents, and soaps that are derived from biomass (furans from sugars and fatty acids from triglycerides, oleo-furan sulfonates (OFS).

At any given time, a typical mammalian cell may contain several hundred thousand mRNA and other, regulatory long RNA molecules. How cells distinguish exogenous long RNA from the large amount of endogenous long RNA is an important open question in cell biology. Several reports suggest that phosphorylation of the 5'-end of a long RNA molecule can influence its immunogenicity, and specifically that 5'-triphosphate RNA, which can be produced during viral infection, is more immunogenic than 5'-diphosphate RNA, 5'-monophosphate RNA or RNA containing no 5' phosphate. However, in vitro-transcribed (ivT) long RNA containing a 7-methylguanosine cap (present in eukaryotic mRNA) is also highly immunogenic despite having no 5' phosphate, suggesting that characteristics other than 5'-phosphorylation can influence the",

This material constitutes about 8% of the total lipid in such strains. We now report that this excess diglyceride is recovered in the particulate fraction, primarily in association with the inner, cytoplasmic membrane. The diglyceride kinase of wild-type cells was recovered in the same inner membrane fractions. The conditions employed for the preparation of the membranes did not appear to cause significant redistribution of lipids and proteins. The biochemical reactions leading to the formation of diglyceride in E. coli are not known. To determine whether diglyceride formation requires concurrent synthesis of the membrane-derived oligosaccharides (H. Schulman and E. P. Kennedy, J. Biol. Chem. 252:4250-4255, 1977), we have constructed a double mutant defective in both the kinase (dgk) and phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi). When oligosaccharide synthesis was inhibited in this organism by growing the cells on amino acids as the sole carbon source, the diglyceride was no longer present in large amounts. When glucose was also added to the medium, the pgi mutation was bypassed, oligosaccharide synthesis resumed, and diglyceride again accumulated. These findings suggest that diglyceride may arise during the transfer of the sn-glycero-1-P moiety from phosphatidylglycerol (and possibly cardiolipin) to the oligosaccharides. In wild-type cells the kinase permits the cyclical reutilization of diglyceride molecules for phospholipid biosynthesis.",

While functionalized carotenoids in themselves are an attractive astrobiological biomarker, detecting their diagenetic products may be equally characteristic of extraterrestrial life. Detection of diagenetically reduced lycopane on other planetary bodies may be an unambiguous indication of life, as diagenesis occurs during biological fossilization. References Alkanes Biomarkers",

In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning (see also palytoxin, synthesized by the research group of Yoshito Kishi, one of Woodward's postdoctoral students).

Acyl-labeled phosphatidylcholine and acyl-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine were rapidly degraded by acetone powder preparations to 1,2-diglyceride via phosphatidic acid.

In previous studies the related thermodynamic functions have been measured for spread phospholipid monolayers at the oil/water interface over a range of temperatures and densities, and the two-dimensional virial coefficients obtained. These coefficients have been computed from a model that emphasizes the head group zwitterion interactions. In this study we examine the contribution of the diglyceride portion of phospholipid molecules to the lateral intermolecular forces. Measurements of the heptane/water interfacial tension as a function of the concentration of 1,2-dipalmitoyl glycerol (DP) in the heptane were made over a range of low surface pressures at 25 degrees C. Infrared measurements on the DP solutions show that the solutions are ideal. The results are interpreted to give two-dimensional virial coefficients for the adsorbed monolayer. The second virial coefficient B2(T) for DP is +0.31 nm2/molecule, in marked contrast to the much larger positive values found for the corresponding phospholipids at the same interface and temperature, and clearly indicating an attractive component to the lateral potentials of mean force between pairs of DP molecules. The contribution of the diglyceride moiety to the pair potentials of the phospholipids thus appears to be minor but not negligible. The differences in the second virial coefficients for DP and the phospholipids are interpreted primarily in terms of the orientation of the ester carbonyl dipoles, also drawing on spectroscopic and diffraction evidence from related structures.",

Each molecule of FPP is in turn the product of two molecules of dimethylallyl diphosphate and two molecules of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).
