Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

Important families of molecular machines not belonging to the interlocking world were also designed, prepared, and studied but, for most of them, their elaboration was more recent than that of catenanes or rotaxanes. Since the creation of interlocking ring molecules is so important in relation to the molecular machinery area, we will start with this aspect of our work. The second part will naturally be devoted to the dynamic properties of such systems and to the compounds for which motions can be directed in a controlled manner from the outside, that is, molecular machines. We will restrict our discussion to a very limited number of examples which we consider as particularly representative of the field.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

The basic theory is outlined in this paper, and examples of the effects, and their interpretation in illustrative examples is presented.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

No wonder the city's boosters were cheering: More than 10,000 scientists, purveyors of laboratory equipment, and other chemophiles had flooded into Denver to take in a vision of chemistry's intellectual scope that was wide enough to compensate for the missing scenic grandeur. In just a tiny sampling of the roughly 4800 presentations, chemistry appears in guises ranging from the most basic molecule making, through cleanup strategies for major environmental challenges, to forensic methods for unraveling a historical mystery.",

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors.

In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

They differ from other concerted reactions, such as S(N)2, E2, or pericyclic reactions, in such a way that atoms are involved in the transition state at which two bonds are made and two bonds are broken simultaneously. Similar to pericyclic reactions, an electron count can be used to predict reactivity and stereochemistry. The \"coarctate rules\" are derived from a topological variant of the aromaticity of the transition state principle. Pseudocoarctate transition states exhibit disconnections in the topology of orbital overlap and do not necessarily follow the coarctate rules.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

We describe the scope and limitations of the cascade synthesis approaches and the development of an enantioselectively catalyzed centrocountin synthesis.",

The prominence of the P-S cyclization is brought about by the inheritance from analogous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the biogenetic pathways of natural products, mainly indole alkaloids, with a broad range of biological activities. This knowledge has been the starting point for the biomimetic synthesis or the bio-engineering production of pharmacologically important drugs. The long-lasting life of the P-S reaction depends on the discovery of its multiple facets, the modifications of its parameters and components, as well as the continuous renovation of solutions for the challenging stereochemical outcome of the transformation. This paper deals with an updated visit to the P-S reaction aiming to find the threads of the story without forgetting the numerous facets of the prism. It is organized as a theater piece, with a prologue and the main scene (namely, Act 1) where the readers can follow the parade of the two above-mentioned very recurring motifs (namely, THIQ and THBC) by moving from one step to another (a cyclization, an intramolecular attack, a stereoselective passage) to find the way out of the labyrinth of the P-S reaction.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions.

Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The chirality code is a sequence of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to the value of a certain \"chirality function\" at equidistant points within a chosen interval. For molecules of moderate size the chirality function has thousands of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each quartet of atoms. Therefore it looks as if the chirality code cannot provide a faithful representation of the chirality function and thus a faithful representation of the molecular structure. We now show that functional groups present in the molecule result in clusters of near-lying and partially overlapping peaks, whose position in the chirality code is characteristic for the particular functional group. This enables a sound structural interpretation of the chirality code.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Post-MCR transformations to give heterocycles or peptidomimetics, variants through single component replacement, stereochemical issues, and applications in total syntheses will be especially covered.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Sci. 2001, 41, 369-375], aimed at distinguishing between enantiomers. The chirality code is a sequence of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to the value of a certain \"chirality function\" at equidistant points within a chosen interval. For molecules of moderate size the chirality function has thousands of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each quartet of atoms. Therefore it looks as if the chirality code cannot provide a faithful representation of the chirality function and thus a faithful representation of the molecular structure. We now show that functional groups present in the molecule result in clusters of near-lying and partially overlapping peaks, whose position in the chirality code is characteristic for the particular functional group. This enables a sound structural interpretation of the chirality code.",

The measure is based on the distance between the chiral molecule and the nearest structure that is achiral. Questions such as the following can be addressed: by how much is one molecule more chiral than the other? how does chirality change along conformational motions? is there a correlation between chirality and enantioselectivity in a series of molecules?

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Since carbon chains present isomerism and the number of possible structures increases fast with the number of carbon atoms, a B3LYP∕aug-cc-pVTZ search of stationary points has been achieved. For C7, we found twelve minimal structures. Among these forms, eleven C7 isomers are located into the lowest singlet hyper potential energy surface. The most stable form of C7 is linear and possesses a (1)Σg(+) symmetry species. For C7(-), we characterized fifteen stable forms, where twelve are of doublet spin-multiplicity. The global minimum of C7(-) is a (2)Πg doubly degenerate Renner-Teller structure. For C7(+) cation, we found eleven doublet and three quartet isomers with a 7-atom cycle, C7(+) (X(2)A1) ground state. For the most stable forms, explicitly correlated (R)CCSD(T)-F12 calculations have been performed for the determination of equilibrium geometries and for the spectroscopic characterization of C7, C7(-), and C7(+), providing accurate rotational constants and harmonic frequencies. Vertical excitation energies to the lowest electronic states have been computed at the CASSCF∕MRCI∕aug-cc-pVTZ level. Thirty five electronic states of C7, suitable of being involved in reactive processes, lie below 7 eV. Fourteen metastable electronic states of C7(-) have been found below 3.5 eV. For linear-C7, we compute the electron affinity and the ionization energy to be 3.38 eV and 10.42 eV, respectively.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

In terms of modern concepts, the hydrogen bond is understood as a very broad phenomenon, and it is accepted that there are open borders to other effects. There are dozens of different types of X-H.A hydrogen bonds that occur commonly in the condensed phases, and in addition there are innumerable less common ones. Dissociation energies span more than two orders of magnitude (about 0.2-40 kcal mol(-1)). Within this range, the nature of the interaction is not constant, but its electrostatic, covalent, and dispersion contributions vary in their relative weights. The hydrogen bond has broad transition regions that merge continuously with the covalent bond, the van der Waals interaction, the ionic interaction, and also the cation-pi interaction. All hydrogen bonds can be considered as incipient proton transfer reactions, and for strong hydrogen bonds, this reaction can be in a very advanced state.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The prominence of the P-S cyclization is brought about by the inheritance from analogous enzyme-catalyzed reactions of the biogenetic pathways of natural products, mainly indole alkaloids, with a broad range of biological activities. This knowledge has been the starting point for the biomimetic synthesis or the bio-engineering production of pharmacologically important drugs. The long-lasting life of the P-S reaction depends on the discovery of its multiple facets, the modifications of its parameters and components, as well as the continuous renovation of solutions for the challenging stereochemical outcome of the transformation. This paper deals with an updated visit to the P-S reaction aiming to find the threads of the story without forgetting the numerous facets of the prism. It is organized as a theater piece, with a prologue and the main scene (namely, Act 1) where the readers can follow the parade of the two above-mentioned very recurring motifs (namely, THIQ and THBC) by moving from one step to another (a cyclization, an intramolecular attack, a stereoselective passage) to find the way out of the labyrinth of the P-S reaction.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

New conformations are generated via distortion along these modes and their pairwise combinations, followed by energy minimization. For complexes, special treatment is accorded to the six coordinates that specify the position and orientation of one molecule relative to the other.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two! Enjoy your time in this very special museum. -Jeffrey I. Seeman Guest Editor University of Richmond Richmond, Virginia 23173, USA E-mail: jseeman@richmond.edu. ",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown.

In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

What took place for methylene, namely the establishment of credibility for theory, has subsequently taken place for many other molecules. Three important roles for quantitative theory are outlined: (i) theory precedes experiment; (ii) theory overturns experiment, as resolved by later experiments; and (iii) theory and experiment work together to gain insight that is afforded independently to neither.

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

The chirality code is a sequence of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to the value of a certain \"chirality function\" at equidistant points within a chosen interval. For molecules of moderate size the chirality function has thousands of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each quartet of atoms. Therefore it looks as if the chirality code cannot provide a faithful representation of the chirality function and thus a faithful representation of the molecular structure. We now show that functional groups present in the molecule result in clusters of near-lying and partially overlapping peaks, whose position in the chirality code is characteristic for the particular functional group.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The usual approach is generally assumed to be justified by the 1927 work of Born and Oppenheimer. In this paper we discuss what precisely might be anticipated in the way of molecular structure from a mathematical consideration of the spectral properties of the full Coulomb Hamiltonian, to what extent the very idea of molecular structure might be dependent upon treating the nuclei simply as providing a potential and the extent to which the work of Born and Oppenheimer can be used to support this position.",

Contribution from the dispersion energy is important in typical cases where aliphatic or aromatic CH groups are involved. Coulombic energy is of minor importance as compared to the other weak hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond nature of this force, however, has been confirmed by AIM analyses. The dual characteristic of the CH/π hydrogen bond is the basis for ubiquitous existence of this force in various fields of chemistry. A salient feature is that the CH/π hydrogen bond works cooperatively. Another significant point is that it works in nonpolar as well as polar, protic solvents such as water. The interaction energy depends on the nature of the molecular fragments, CH as well as π-groups: the stronger the proton donating ability of the CH group, the larger the stabilizing effect. This Perspective focuses on the consequence of this molecular force in the conformation of organic compounds and supramolecular chemistry. Implication of the CH/π hydrogen bond extends to the specificity of molecular recognition or selectivity in organic reactions, polymer science, surface phenomena and interactions involving proteins. Many problems, unsettled to date, will become clearer in the light of the CH/π paradigm.",

The chirality code is a sequence of (typically 100) numbers, being equal to the value of a certain \"chirality function\" at equidistant points within a chosen interval. For molecules of moderate size the chirality function has thousands of peaks (maxima and minima), one for each quartet of atoms. Therefore it looks as if the chirality code cannot provide a faithful representation of the chirality function and thus a faithful representation of the molecular structure. We now show that functional groups present in the molecule result in clusters of near-lying and partially overlapping peaks, whose position in the chirality code is characteristic for the particular functional group.

Questions such as the following can be addressed: by how much is one molecule more chiral than the other? how does chirality change along conformational motions? is there a correlation between chirality and enantioselectivity in a series of molecules?

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

The basic theory is outlined in this paper, and examples of the effects, and their interpretation in illustrative examples is presented.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Because of this inherent flexibility, users are often presented with diverse, even divergent, choices for solving every type of problem. Recently, CCP4 introduced CCP4i2, a modern graphical interface designed to help structural biologists to navigate the process of structure determination, with an emphasis on pipelining and the streamlined presentation of results. In addition, CCP4i2 provides a framework for writing structure-solution scripts that can be built up incrementally to create increasingly automatic procedures.",

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones.

The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Conformation, supramolecules, optical resolution and interactions involving carbohydrates.\nThe CH/π hydrogen bond is an attractive molecular force occurring between a soft acid and a soft base. Contribution from the dispersion energy is important in typical cases where aliphatic or aromatic CH groups are involved. Coulombic energy is of minor importance as compared to the other weak hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond nature of this force, however, has been confirmed by AIM analyses. The dual characteristic of the CH/π hydrogen bond is the basis for ubiquitous existence of this force in various fields of chemistry. A salient feature is that the CH/π hydrogen bond works cooperatively. Another significant point is that it works in nonpolar as well as polar, protic solvents such as water. The interaction energy depends on the nature of the molecular fragments, CH as well as π-groups: the stronger the proton donating ability of the CH group, the larger the stabilizing effect. This Perspective focuses on the consequence of this molecular force in the conformation of organic compounds and supramolecular chemistry. Implication of the CH/π hydrogen bond extends to the specificity of molecular recognition or selectivity in organic reactions, polymer science, surface phenomena and interactions involving proteins. Many problems, unsettled to date, will become clearer in the light of the CH/π paradigm.",

One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Although such terms are precisely defined, their use often engenders confusion and ambiguity. Perhaps, the most improper use of chirality, yet widely accepted, is related to its association with stereodynamics and physico-chemical transformations, such as chiral discrimination, chiral resolution, chiral recognition, chiral synthesis, and so on. Even though this conceptual perversion has been highlighted by renowned stereochemists, it has become a recurring keyword and a hot message in modern literature. It is timely to renew the correct use and context in forums such as the present journal, adding further reflections that may help both beginners and practitioners.

Chemistry is also a fantastic world populated by an unbelievable number of nanometric objects called molecules, the smallest entities that have distinct shapes, sizes, and properties. Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces. Some nice stories based on chemical concepts (1) show that there cannot be borders on the Earth, (2) underline that there is a tight connection among all forms of matter, and (3) emphasize the irreplaceable role of sunlight.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

The value of this measure ranges from zero, the molecule is achiral, to higher values (the upper limit is 100); the higher the chirality value, the more chiral the molecule is. The measure is based on the distance between the chiral molecule and the nearest structure that is achiral. Questions such as the following can be addressed: by how much is one molecule more chiral than the other? how does chirality change along conformational motions? is there a correlation between chirality and enantioselectivity in a series of molecules? Both elementary and advanced features are offered. Related calculation options are the symmetry measures and shape measures.",

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

This article is a sequel to that work. As a vast quantity of research has been addressed to the topic in the intervening period, the view presented here can at best be selective and idiosyncratic.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

All one needs to do is explore a flea market, an antique fair or especially a weekend street market to understand the range of human collections. Tetsuo Nozoe, whom this project celebrates, collected autographs as well as the friendship of those who signed his books! What we collect doesn't necessarily have to be tangible. We all collect memories, stories, and anecdotes. We chemists are particularly privileged: we also collect molecules and reactions. In the essay that follows, Professor Henning Hopf shares with us his collection of favorite aromatic compounds. Hopf is the perfect chemist to have undertaken this sharing, for he has been active in the field of novel aromatic compounds for over four decades. Furthermore, Hopf is a deeply philosophical scientist. I very much admire his 2008 paper with Roald Hoffmann, \"Learning from Molecules in Distress\" published in Angewandte Chemie, a journal from the same pubilshers as The Chemical Record. As you read the paper that follows, imagine that Professor Hopf has just welcomed you to his home and is giving you a tour of his artwork. The walls are covered with works of Boekelheide, Cram, Fittig, Hückel, Kuck, Müllen, Newman, Scott, and Willstätter among others. Oh, yes, there's a Hopf or two!

Nearly 80% of new structural data arrives electronically, mostly in CIF format, and the CCDC acts as the official crystal structure data depository for 51 major journals. The CCDC now maintains both a CIF archive (more than 73,000 CIFs dating from 1996), as well as the distributed binary CSD archive; the availability of data in both archives is discussed. A statistical survey of the CSD is also presented and projections concerning future accession rates indicate that the CSD will contain at least 500,000 crystal structures by the year 2010.",

In this brief overview, we shall discuss three examples of significant concepts that have come out of the Hellmann-Feynman theorem: (1) The forces exerted upon the nuclei in molecules are entirely Coulombic in nature. (2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities. To summarize, energy and force analyses should not be viewed as competitive but rather as complementary.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei. (3) Dispersion forces are due to the attractions of nuclei to their own polarized electronic densities.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner.

Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Molecules are the words of matter. Indeed, most of the other sciences have been permeated by the concepts of chemistry and the language of molecules. Like words, molecules contain specific pieces of information that are revealed when they interact with one another or when they are stimulated by photons or electrons. In the hands of chemists, molecules, particularly when they are suitably combined or assembled to create supramolecular systems, can play a variety of functions, even more complex and more clever than those invented by nature. The wonderful world of chemistry has inspired scientists not only to prepare new molecules or investigate new chemical processes, but also to create masterpieces.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Conformation, supramolecules, optical resolution and interactions involving carbohydrates.\nThe CH/π hydrogen bond is an attractive molecular force occurring between a soft acid and a soft base. Contribution from the dispersion energy is important in typical cases where aliphatic or aromatic CH groups are involved. Coulombic energy is of minor importance as compared to the other weak hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond nature of this force, however, has been confirmed by AIM analyses. The dual characteristic of the CH/π hydrogen bond is the basis for ubiquitous existence of this force in various fields of chemistry. A salient feature is that the CH/π hydrogen bond works cooperatively. Another significant point is that it works in nonpolar as well as polar, protic solvents such as water. The interaction energy depends on the nature of the molecular fragments, CH as well as π-groups: the stronger the proton donating ability of the CH group, the larger the stabilizing effect. This Perspective focuses on the consequence of this molecular force in the conformation of organic compounds and supramolecular chemistry. Implication of the CH/π hydrogen bond extends to the specificity of molecular recognition or selectivity in organic reactions, polymer science, surface phenomena and interactions involving proteins. Many problems, unsettled to date, will become clearer in the light of the CH/π paradigm.",

In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood.

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Indeed, efforts to synthesize natural products often become case studies in the art and science of chemoselective control, a skill that nature has practiced deftly for billions of years but man has yet to master. Confrontation of one or perhaps a collection of functional groups that are either promiscuously reactive or stubbornly inert has the potential to unravel an entire strategic design. One could argue that the degree to which chemists can control chemoselectivity pales in comparison to the state of the art in stereocontrol. In this Account, we hope to illustrate how the combination of necessity and tenacity leads to the invention of chemoselective chemistry for the construction of complex molecules. In our laboratory, a premium is placed upon selecting targets that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using traditional techniques. The successful total synthesis of such molecules demands a high degree of innovation, which in turn enables the discovery of new reactivity and principles for controlling chemoselectivity. In devising an approach to a difficult target, we choose bond disconnections that primarily maximize skeletal simplification, especially when the proposed chemistry is poorly precedented or completely unknown. By choosing such a strategy--rather than adapting an approach to fit known reactions--innovation and invention become the primary goal of the total synthesis. Delivery of the target molecule in a concise and convergent manner is the natural consequence of such endeavors, and invention becomes a prerequisite for success.",

Conformation, supramolecules, optical resolution and interactions involving carbohydrates.\nThe CH/π hydrogen bond is an attractive molecular force occurring between a soft acid and a soft base. Contribution from the dispersion energy is important in typical cases where aliphatic or aromatic CH groups are involved. Coulombic energy is of minor importance as compared to the other weak hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond nature of this force, however, has been confirmed by AIM analyses. The dual characteristic of the CH/π hydrogen bond is the basis for ubiquitous existence of this force in various fields of chemistry. A salient feature is that the CH/π hydrogen bond works cooperatively. Another significant point is that it works in nonpolar as well as polar, protic solvents such as water. The interaction energy depends on the nature of the molecular fragments, CH as well as π-groups: the stronger the proton donating ability of the CH group, the larger the stabilizing effect. This Perspective focuses on the consequence of this molecular force in the conformation of organic compounds and supramolecular chemistry. Implication of the CH/π hydrogen bond extends to the specificity of molecular recognition or selectivity in organic reactions, polymer science, surface phenomena and interactions involving proteins. Many problems, unsettled to date, will become clearer in the light of the CH/π paradigm.",
