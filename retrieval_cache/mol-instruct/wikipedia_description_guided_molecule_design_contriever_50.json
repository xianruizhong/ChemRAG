The earliest record dates back to 200 BCE, in the Fifty-two Prescriptions unearthed from the Mawangdui. Its antimalarial application was first described in Zhouhou Beiji Fang (The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies, ), edited in the middle of the 4th century CE by Ge Hong; in that book, 43 malaria treatment methods were recorded. Images of the original scientific papers that record the history of the discovery, have been available online since 2006.",

Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies) are now standard treatment worldwide for malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. It has been shown that whole leaf Artemisia annua increases artemisinin bioavailability, making it more effective. Administering Artemesia annua as dried whole leaves may cause resistance to develop more slowly than if it is administered as pure artemisenin. Dried leaf Artemesia may also be helpful in cases where the malaria has become resistant to artemisinin combination therapy and artesunate. The World Health Organization does not support the promotion or use of Artemisia plant material in any form for the prevention or treatment of malaria. They note that the plant form of medication has several problems. These include a lack of consistent Artemisia content, the content",

The use of this representation has been in the prediction of biochemical properties (incl. toxicity and biodegradability) based on the main principle of chemoinformatics that similar molecules have similar properties. The predictive models implemented a syntactic pattern recognition approach (which involved defining a molecular distance) as well as a more robust scheme based on statistical pattern recognition.

The 11-peroxyl radical cyclizes at carbon 9 and the carbon-centered radical generated at C-8 cyclizes at carbon 12, generating the endoperoxide. The allylic radical generated is trapped by dioxygen at carbon 15 to form the 15-(S) -peroxyl radical; this radical is then reduced to PGG2 . This is supported by the following evidence: 1) a significant kinetic isotope effect is observed for the abstraction of the 13-pro (S )-hydrogen; 2) carbon-centered radicals are trapped during catalysis; 3) small amounts of oxidation products are formed due to the oxygen trapping of an allylic radical intermediate at positions 13 and 15.",

This is prevented, with retention of activity, by methylation to give the C-15 tertiary carbinol series. This molecular feature is readily introduced at the stage of the Corey lactone (1) by reaction with methyl Grignard reagent or trimethylaluminium. The resulting mixture of tertiary carbinols (2) is transformed to oxytocic carboprost (3) by standard transformations, including separation of diastereomers, so that the final product is the C-15 analogue. This diastereomer is reputably freeer of porstaglandin side effects than the C-15 (S) isomer. See also Arbaprostil References Further reading External links Orphan drugs Prostaglandins",

Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype–phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state.

Beeswax is a tough wax formed from a mixture of several chemical compounds. An approximate chemical formula for beeswax is C15H31COOC30H61. Its main constituents are palmitate, palmitoleate, and oleate esters of long-chain (30–32 carbons) aliphatic alcohols, with the ratio of triacontanyl palmitate CH3(CH2)29O-CO-(CH2)14CH3 to cerotic acid CH3(CH2)24COOH, the two principal constituents, being 6:1. Beeswax can be classified generally into European and Oriental types. The saponification value is lower (3–5) for European beeswax, and higher (8–9) for Oriental types.The analytical characterization can be done by high-temperature gas chromatography. Beeswax has a relatively low melting point range of 62 to 64 °C (144 to 147 °F). If beeswax is heated above 85 °C (185 °F) discoloration occurs. The flash point of beeswax is 204.4 °C (400 °F).",

Pharmacophore modeling identifies key electronic and structural features that are associated with therapeutic activity across similarly bioactive structural analogs, and accordingly requires large libraries with corresponding experimental data to enhance predictive power. Compound structures are superimposed virtually and common elements are scored on the basis of their tendency toward bioactivity. The move away from lock-and-key based modeling toward induced-fit based modeling has improved binding predictions but has also given rise to the challenge of modeling ligand flexibility, which requires building a database of conformational models and utilizes large amounts of data storage space. Another approach is the so-called on-the-fly method, in which conformational models are tested during the process of pharmacophore",

By restricting components of ADEP to decrease the molecule's flexibility, binding was enhanced and antimicrobial activity significantly increased. Specific amino acids essential to the peptidolactone core of ADEP were altered and restricted, causing stabilization of ADEP in a bioactive conformation. In fact, the conformational restrictions of ADEP resulted in its ability to activate ClpP increasing seven-fold and its antimicrobial activity 1200-fold. Research on altering ADEP molecules continues in attempt to construct a new antibiotic for public use. References Further reading Molecular description of ADEP1 Antibiotics",

Its systematic name is [2-(4-hydroxy-1Hindol-3-yl)ethyl](methyl)propan-2-ylazanium 3-carboxyprop-2-enoate monohydrate. The salt consists of a protonated tryptammonium cation and a 3-carboxyacrylate (hydrogen fumarate) anion in the asymmetric unit along with a water molecule of crystallization. Pharmacology 4-HO-MiPT is thought to be a serotonergic psychedelic. Like other serotonergic psychedelics, its method of action is believed to result from its partial agonism of 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors.",

The term adjudant is used in French-speaking armed forces as a non-commissioned officer rank similar to a staff sergeant or warrant officer but is not equivalent to the role or appointment of an adjutant. An adjutant general is commander of an army's administrative services. Etymology Adjutant comes from the Latin adiutāns, present participle of the verb adiūtāre, frequentative form of adiuvāre 'to help'; the Romans actually used adiūtor for the noun. Military and paramilitary appointment In various uniformed hierarchies, the term is used for number of functions, but generally as a principal aide to a commanding officer.",

Synthesis and reactions It is obtained as a minor product in the Friedel–Crafts methylation of xylene to durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene). Like durene, pentamethylbenzene is rather electron-rich and undergoes electrophilic substitution readily. Indeed, it is used as a scavenger for carbocations. Pentamethylbenzene has been observed as an intermediate in the formation of hexamethylbenzene from phenol and alkylation of durene or pentamethylbenzene has been reported as a suitable starting material for the synthesis of hexamethylbenzene.

The general structure of flavonoids is a 15-carbon skeleton, containing 2 benzene rings connected by a 3-carbon linking chain. Therefore, they are depicted as C6-C3-C6 compounds. Depending on the chemical structure, degree of oxidation, and unsaturation of the linking chain (C3), flavonoids can be classified into different groups, such as anthocyanidins, chalcones, flavonols, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, flavanonols, flavones, and isoflavonoids. Furthermore, flavonoids can be found in plants in glycoside-bound and free aglycone forms. The glycoside-bound form is the most common flavone and flavonol form consumed in the diet.",

One toxin produced, pardaxin-1, does have unusual shark repellent and surfactant properties it created voltage-dependent, ion-permeable channels in membranes and at high concentration it causes lysis in cell membranes. This toxin has been demonstrated to be 5-10 times more toxic, cytolytic and active in the formation of pores in cell membranes than the other toxin exuded, pardaxin-2. This species is found in shallow, coastal waters where the seabed consists of sand or mud, often near coral reefs, and they feed mainly on benthic invertebrates. It is caught for consumption, despite the poison it exudes and is marketed fresh. They often spend the day buried in the sand with only its eyes and nostrils visible.",

Even more effective is a mixture of lithium aluminium hydride and aluminium trichloride, a source of \"AlClH2\" and \"AlCl2H\". Azetidine can also be produced by a multistep route from 3-amino-1-propanol. Regio- and diastereoselective synthesis of 2-arylazetidines could be performed from appropriately substituted oxiranes via ring transformation. It is controlled by Baldwin's Rules with remarkable functional group tolerance.",

The compound is classified as an aromatic hydrocarbon. It is a relatively easily oxidized benzene derivative, with E1/2 of 1.95 V vs NHE. Synthesis and reactions It is obtained as a minor product in the Friedel–Crafts methylation of xylene to durene (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene). Like durene, pentamethylbenzene is rather electron-rich and undergoes electrophilic substitution readily. Indeed, it is used as a scavenger for carbocations. Pentamethylbenzene has been observed as an intermediate in the formation of hexamethylbenzene from phenol and alkylation of durene or pentamethylbenzene has been reported as a suitable starting material for the synthesis of hexamethylbenzene.

Dioxane is used as a solvent for a variety of practical applications as well as in the laboratory, and also as a stabilizer for the transport of chlorinated hydrocarbons in aluminum containers. Synthesis Dioxane is produced by the acid-catalysed dehydration of diethylene glycol, which in turn is obtained from the hydrolysis of ethylene oxide. In 1985, the global production capacity for dioxane was between 11,000 and 14,000 tons. In 1990, the total U.S. production volume of dioxane was between 5,250 and 9,150 tons.",

These icosahedral cages have been investigated for use in drug delivery or as vaccines, delivering antigens.

It is a colorless liquid with a weak, ammonia- or fish-like odor. The naming of morpholine is attributed to Ludwig Knorr, who incorrectly believed it to be part of the structure of morphine.

Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules.

Its molecular structure contains DNA bases attached to a backbone of methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups. Morpholinos block access of other molecules to small (~25 base) specific sequences of the base-pairing surfaces of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Morpholinos are used as research tools for reverse genetics by knocking down gene function.",

Laundon described three chemotypes of this species: one with the chemical clycin, one with pinatric acid, and a third with both of these compounds. Life cycle Lacking apothecia, soredia and isidia, C. candelaris is not able to reproduce by spores, but spreads by its thallus becoming distributed by the wind, the feet of animals, etc. to suitable habitats.

Glycosides can be linked by an O- (an O-glycoside), N- (a glycosylamine), S-(a thioglycoside), or C- (a C-glycoside) glycosidic bond. According to the IUPAC, the name \"C-glycoside\" is a misnomer; the preferred term is \"C-glycosyl compound\". The given definition is the one used by IUPAC, which recommends the Haworth projection to correctly assign stereochemical configurations. Many authors require in addition that the sugar be bonded to a non-sugar for the molecule to qualify as a glycoside, thus excluding polysaccharides. The sugar group is then known as the glycone and the non-sugar group as the aglycone or genin part of the glycoside. The glycone can consist of a single sugar group (monosaccharide), two sugar groups (disaccharide), or several sugar groups (oligosaccharide).",

It can be found in millets grown in Central and Southern parts of India. Phytoglycogen is a highly branched polysaccharide used to store glucose in a similar way that glycogen is the glucose storage for animals. It is made up of branched, flexible chains on glucose molecules that grow similarly to synthetic dendrimers. The special structure of the phytoglycogen allows it to have low viscosity, high water retention, as well as high stability in water, and stabilize bioactive compounds and form films on surfaces. Thus, this monodisperse nanoparticle is able to be used in many different technologies. References Polysaccharides",

Pyrazoles are also a class of compounds that have the ring C3N2 with adjacent nitrogen atoms. Notable drugs containing a pyrazole ring are celecoxib (Celebrex) and the anabolic steroid stanozolol. Preparation and reactions Pyrazoles are synthesized by the reaction of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes with hydrazine and subsequent dehydrogenation: Substituted pyrazoles are prepared by condensation of 1,3-diketones with hydrazine (Knorr-type reactions).

The order Actinomycetales is composed of organisms well known for their ability to make a wide range of biologically active metabolites. S. lavendulae produces many medically useful antibiotics including streptothricin and lavendamycin, although some mutant strains exist without aerial mycelium, which are unable to produce antibiotics.",
