It is an example of a half-sandwich complex. It is a dark red air sensitive liquid. This compound features one cyclopentadienyl ring that is bound in an Î·5-manner and two carbonyl ligands. The compound is soluble in common organic solvents. Preparation CpCo(CO)2 was first reported in 1954 by Piper, Cotton, and Wilkinson who produced it by the reaction of cobalt carbonyl with cyclopentadiene. It is prepared commercially by the same method: Co2(CO)8 + 2 C5H6 â 2 C5H5Co(CO)2 + H2 + 4 CO Alternatively, it is generated by the high pressure carbonylation of bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt (cobaltocene) at elevated temperature and pressures: Co(C5H5)2 + 2 CO â C5H5Co(CO)2 + \"C5H5\" The compound is identified by strong bands in its IR spectrum at 2030 and 1960 cmâ1.",

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200â400 Â°C with a 54% yield.",

The nitro group (RCH2NO2) is converted to RCNO in the reaction, with CO2 as one of the by products. Structure PhNCO is a planar molecule, according to X-ray crystallography. The N=C=O linkage is nearly linear. The C=N and C=O distances are respectively 1.195 and 1.173 Ã. References External links Phenyl Isocyanate Data Sheet Isocyanates Phenyl compounds",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material.

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction.

Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]â, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2]. Ketones are produced by carbonylation of these dialkyl complexes, regenerating CpCo(CO)2.",

At -60 ÌC the reaction of 1 and 2 afforded evenly to the lactone (3), the carbonyl addition product which underwent conversion on treatment with acid. The free acid (4) was obtained when the latter was cleaved reductively with zinc and alkali. Cyclization of the product occurred when treated with ZnCl2 in acetic acid anhydride and gave the compound 6-acetoxy-3-MC (5).

Contrary to their usual roles as intermediates in ozonolysis and other oxidative alkene cleavage reactions, 1,2,4-trioxolanes are relatively stable compounds and are isolable. Mechanism The oxime first reacts with the ozone to form the corresponding carbonyl oxide, which undergoes 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with the carbonyl molecule to form the tetrasubstituted ozonide. If no carbonyl compound is used, the carbonyl oxide may dimerize and form 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes. References Name reactions",

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide Î²-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups.

After determining the type of rotation, whether the product will be cis or trans can be determined by examining the starting molecule. In the example below, the disrotation causes both methyls to point upwards, causing the product to be cis-dimethylcyclohexadiene. In addition, the torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction of rotation. For example, a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions, producing enantiomeric products. A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation (partially or completely) to produce a product in enantiomeric excess. Mechanism of thermal reactions WoodwardâHoffmann rules Correlation diagrams, which connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to those of the product having the same symmetry, can then be constructed for the two processes.",

This may be solved to find the steady-state concentration of â¢CH3 radicals as [â¢CH3] = (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]1/2. It follows that the rate of formation of CH4 is d[CH4]/dt = k2[â¢CH3][CH3CHO] = k2 (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]3/2 Thus the mechanism explains the observed rate expression, for the principal products CH4 and CO.

Production By condensing propadienedithione SCCCS or thioxopropadienone OCCCS in solid argon and irradiating with ultraviolet radiation, CCS is formed. Another way is via a glow discharge in a mixture of carbon disulfide and helium. Yet another way is through electron irradiation of sulfur containing heterocycles.

The resonating arrow (1) shows a resonance contributor of the diazo compound with a lone pair of electrons on the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen. The diazo compound then does a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl-containing compound (nucleophilic addition), producing a tetrahedral intermediate (2). This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups. The epoxide product is formed by an intramolecular addition reaction in which a lone pair from the oxygen attacks the carbocation (6).",

The kinetic product arises from a DielsâAlder reaction, while a cheletropic reaction gives rise to a more thermodynamically stable product.

It is classified as a carbonate ester. This compound has found use as a methylating agent and more recently as a solvent that is exempt from the restrictions placed on most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the US. Dimethyl carbonate is often considered to be a green reagent. Production World production in 1997 was estimated at 1000 barrels a day. Production of dimethyl carbonate worldwide is limited to Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Dimethyl carbonate is traditionally prepared by the reaction of phosgene and methanol. Methyl chloroformate is produced as an intermediate: COCl2 + CH3OH â CH3OCOCl + HCl CH3OCOCl + CH3OH â CH3OCO2CH3 + HCl This synthesis route has been largely replaced by oxidative carbonylation. In this process, carbon monoxide and an oxidizer provide the equivalent of CO2+: CO + 1/2 O2 + 2 CH3OH â (CH3O)2CO + H2O",

For instance, glucose would be oxidized to gluconate by oxygen. However, the experiment also works with compounds such as vitamin C and benzoin, which do not contain an aldehyde group. Thus, the reaction is actually the oxidation of an acyloin or related Î±-hydroxycarbonyl group, which is a structural feature of glucose, to a 1,2-diketone. The reduced redox dye (colorless state) is formed from oxidized redox dye (blue). The color-change that occurs in the blue bottle experiment has features of a clock reaction, in which a visible change in the concentration of one or more reagents suddenly occurs upon the exhaustion of a limiting reagent. For example, the limiting reactant, oxygen, is consumed by another reactant, benzoin, with the help of safranin as a catalyst. Once the limited amount of oxygen has been used up, the catalyst is unable to change",

This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis.

Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200â400 Â°C with a 54% yield.",

The highly unstable intermediate product splits a molecule of hydrogen cyanide, thus forming beta-gamma unsaturated ketonitriles. On the other hand, in the case of alkenes which do not contain any hydrogen atoms in the allylic position, a transformation with CO (CN) consists in addition of a carbonyl group to the ethylene system, thus forming a 1.3-epoxypropane system (co-worker M.Leplawy).",

First, treating fragment A with n-butyllithium formed carbon anion that attacked the alkyliodide part of fragment B to generate intermediate C (step 1). Then a 3, 4-dihydropyran derivative D was formed through base-mediated elimination reaction on intermediate C (step 2). The protecting group on 1, 3-diol moiety in intermediate D was removed by acid treatment to give the diol product E (step 3). The spiroketal product G was generated via intramolecular ketal formation reaction.

The O-acylisourea will react with amines to give the desired amide 3 and urea 4. The possible reactions of the O-acylisourea 2 produce both desired and undesired products. The O-acylisourea 2 can react with an additional carboxylic acid 1 to give an acid anhydride 5, which can react further to give the amide 3. The main undesired reaction pathway involves the rearrangement of the O-acylisourea 2 to the stable N-acylurea 6. The use of solvents with low dielectric constants such as dichloromethane or chloroform can minimize this side reaction. Examples DCC",

However, these showed limited upside and so research then turned to other methods. Finally, in 1998, T.J Deming discovered organometallic initiators as a method to produce low dispersity products. By using a complex of nickel and cyclooctadiene, Deming was able to produce a product that showed a dispersity of about 1.15, which is very good for most reactions. The organometal complex works by incorporating nickel into the NCA ring and creating a temporary 6 membered ring instead of 5.

With added salt the main product is 1,4-adduct A (82%) with some C (7%). A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide Î²-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200â400 Â°C with a 54% yield.",

The exact pathway for the complete metabolism of HCCPD is not known. There are contradicting results from different studies regarding the composition of excreted material. The metabolites were found to be polar in one study and nonpolar in the other. In addition, some of the potential metabolites such as hexachloro-2-cyclopentanone, hexachloro-3-cyclopentanone, hexachloroindone, or octachloro-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydro-4,7-methanoindene-1,8-dione were not yet identified by extraction of excreted material. As the compound readily undergoes DielsâAlder reactions synthetically, it is possible that the HCCPD could react directly with cellular alkenes in a cycloaddition reaction. This might then explain why HCCPD causes effects at the point of contact for all the possible routes of exposure, in addition to the tissue-binding properties.",

Direct reactions of ligands with the cluster often lead to complex product distributions because the inert OsâCO bonds require high temperatures to break, and at such high temperatures the initially formed adducts react further. More successfully, Os3(CO)12 is converted to more labile derivatives such as Os3(CO)11(MeCN) and Os3(CO)10(MeCN)2 using Me3NO as a decarbonylating agent. Os3(CO)11(MeCN) reacts with a variety of even weakly basic ligands to form adducts such as Os3(CO)11(ethylene) and Os3(CO)11(pyridine). The direct reaction of Os3(CO)12 with ethylene and pyridine results in degradation of these organic ligands to give the vinyl hydride HOs3(CO)10(Î·1,Î·2-C2H3) and the pyridyl-hydride HOs3(CO)10(NC5H4).

The non-protein component is a very potent DNA-damaging agent; However it is extremely unstable and the role of the protein is to protect it and release it to the target DNA. Opening of the epoxide under reductive conditions present in cells creates favorable conditions for a Masamune-Bergman cyclization, leading to formation of benzyne, followed by DNA strand cleavage. Another important member of the chromoprotein group of natural products is kedarcidin. As a medicine it is among the most potent, and in Japan only it has been used against liver cancer clinically.

Labinger's argument, later demonstrated experimentally by Mazanec et al., is based on the mechanism of methane activation, which is a radical mechanism, forming H and CH3 radicals by the homolytic cleavage of the C-H bond. Ethylene and ethane that are proposed products have C-H bonds of similar strength. Thus, any catalyst that can activate methane can also activate the products. The yield of ethylene (and/or ethane) is limited by the relative rates of the methane and ethylene reactions, and these rates are very similar. Reactions of the products lead to higher homologues, and eventually to aromatics and coke. The same limitation applies to direct pyrolysis of methane, which is also a radical process. Nevertheless, some recent work have shown that the mechanism of the OCM could be initiated by an heterolytic cleavage of the C-H bond",

For example, in a normal-demand scenario, a diene bearing an electron-donating group (EDG) at C1 has its largest HOMO coefficient at C4, while the dienophile with an electron withdrawing group (EWG) at C1 has the largest LUMO coefficient at C2. Pairing these two coefficients gives the \"ortho\" product as seen in case 1 in the figure below. A diene substituted at C2 as in case 2 below has the largest HOMO coefficient at C1, giving rise to the \"para\" product.

A significant advantage of this reaction is that it uses relatively inexpensive carboxylic acids (or their salts) and is far less air and moisture sensitive in comparison to typical cross-coupling organometallic reagents. Furthermore, the carboxylic acid moiety is a common feature of natural products and can also be prepared by relatively benign air oxidations. Additional benefits include the broad tolerance of functional groups, as well as the capacity to avoid the use of strong bases.

Production and examples Carbamoyl chlorides are prepared by the reaction of an amine with phosgene: 2 R2NH + COCl2 â R2NCOCl + [R2NH2]Cl They also arise by the addition of hydrogen chloride to isocyanates: RNCO + HCl â RNHCOCl In this way, carbamonyl chlorides can be prepared with N-H functionality.",

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN â RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH â RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN â CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH â RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

With the exception of two experimental runs, Chichibabin himself was unable to obtain product yields in excess of 20% across a variety of reactants, solvents, and other experimental conditions. This, in concert with the high prevalence of byproducts, which would require a multitude of purification steps to isolate pure pyridine product, render unaltered forms of Chichibabin's method unsuitable for applied chemistry. The high proportion of byproducts and low yield are explained by the easily reversible nature of the aldol condensation, and carbonyl chemistry in general. For instance, the following side-reactions could lead to byproduct formation: Imine formation steps: 1.Nucleophilic attack of ammonia at the Î²-, rather than Î±-carbon will prevent enamine/imine formation 2.Nucleophilic attack of ammonia on the enamine or imine",

The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

Early evidence suggested that a direct SN2 displacement was occurring; however more recent results suggest that invertive oxidative addition of copper(I) into the carbon-leaving group bond takes place, generating a copper(III) intermediate which then undergoes reductive elimination to generate the coupled product. Both of these mechanisms predict inversion at the electrophilic carbon, which is observed in a number of cases. On the other hand, experiments with radical traps and the observation of racemization during substitution suggest a radical mechanism. (1)",

When represented in chemical equations products are by convention drawn on the right-hand side, even in the case of reversible reactions. The properties of products such as their energies help determine several characteristics of a chemical reaction such as whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic.

It was claimed in a German patent that the reaction of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with dialkyl cyanamides formed plant protection agents which contained six-membered (P-N=C-N=C-S-) rings. It has been proven in recent times by the reaction of diferrocenyl 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (and Lawesson's reagent) with dimethyl cyanamide that in fact a mixture of several different phosphorus containing compounds is formed. Depending on the concentration of the dimethyl cyanamide in the reaction mixture either a different six membered ring compound (P-N=C-S-C=N-) or a nonheterocylic compound (FcP(S)(NR)(NCS)) is formed as the major product, the other compound is formed as a minor product.",

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction.

This reaction is currently known as the Castagnoli-Cushman reaction. One of its first applications was for the preparation of nitrogen analogues of tetrahydrocannabinol, a pharmacologically active natural product isolated from Cannabis sativa. This versatile transformation has been used to generate polysubstituted lactam carboxylic acids and to prepare benzophenanthridine and protoberberine alkaloids, and hundreds of indenoisoquinolines. A general scheme of the Cushman-Castagnoli reaction, applied to the synthesis of a model indenoisoquinoline, is shown to the right. Later, the conditions were optimized and include the formation of an acyl chloride followed by condensation using AlCl3. Development of the Indenoisoquinolines",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Production By condensing propadienedithione SCCCS or thioxopropadienone OCCCS in solid argon and irradiating with ultraviolet radiation, CCS is formed. Another way is via a glow discharge in a mixture of carbon disulfide and helium. Yet another way is through electron irradiation of sulfur containing heterocycles.

Since there is an intermediate that actually contains a positive charge, bulky groups attached are going to help stabilize the charge on the carbocation through resonance and distribution of charge.

It is also due to this carbocation intermediate that the product does not have to have inversion. The nucleophile can attack from the top or the bottom and therefore create a racemic product. It is important to use a protic solvent, water and alcohols, since an aprotic solvent could attack the intermediate and cause unwanted product.

Carbonyl sulfide can be considered to be intermediate between carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide, both of which are valence isoelectronic with it. Carbonyl sulfide decomposes in the presence of humidity and bases to carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. This compound is found to catalyze the formation of peptides from amino acids.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200â400 Â°C with a 54% yield.",

During a chemical reaction reactants are transformed into products after passing through a high energy transition state. This process results in the consumption of the reactants. It can be a spontaneous reaction or mediated by catalysts which lower the energy of the transition state, and by solvents which provide the chemical environment necessary for the reaction to take place. When represented in chemical equations products are by convention drawn on the right-hand side, even in the case of reversible reactions. The properties of products such as their energies help determine several characteristics of a chemical reaction such as whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic. Additionally the properties of a product can make it easier to extract and purify following a chemical reaction, especially if the product has a different state of matter than the reactants.

As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200â400 Â°C with a 54% yield.",

An interesting expansion in the use of these organocatalysts is the NHC catalyzed olefin isomerization/IMDA cascade reaction to give unique bicyclic scaffolds. Dienyl esters such as 11 were transformed into substituted bicyclo[2.2.2]octanes via an isomerization step stabilized by a hemiacetal azolium intermediate (13). The activation barrier of isomerization of 1,3âhexadiene through a [1,5]âshift is 41 Kcal molâ1 and is expected to increase with conjugation to the ester, thus uncatalyzed isomerization is unlikely. This provides the advantage of bypassing a high barrier of activation, providing access to previously unobtainable IMDA derivatives.",

There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups. The epoxide product is formed by an intramolecular addition reaction in which a lone pair from the oxygen attacks the carbocation (6).",

After release of nitrogen gas and conversion to the metallocarbene, an intermolecular reaction with a carbonyl group can generate the carbonyl ylide. Subsequent cycloaddition reaction with an alkene or alkyne dipolarophile can afford oxygen-containing five-membered rings. Popular catalysts that give modest yields towards synthesizing oxacycles include Rh2(OAc)4 and Cu(acac)2.

Os3(CO)11(MeCN) reacts with a variety of even weakly basic ligands to form adducts such as Os3(CO)11(ethylene) and Os3(CO)11(pyridine). The direct reaction of Os3(CO)12 with ethylene and pyridine results in degradation of these organic ligands to give the vinyl hydride HOs3(CO)10(Î·1,Î·2-C2H3) and the pyridyl-hydride HOs3(CO)10(NC5H4).

However, these showed limited upside and so research then turned to other methods. Finally, in 1998, T.J Deming discovered organometallic initiators as a method to produce low dispersity products. By using a complex of nickel and cyclooctadiene, Deming was able to produce a product that showed a dispersity of about 1.15, which is very good for most reactions.

Reaction mechanism In the generally accepted mechanism proposed by Rudolf Criegee in 1953, the alkene and ozone form an intermediate molozonide in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Next, the molozonide reverts to its corresponding carbonyl oxide (also called the Criegee intermediate or Criegee zwitterion) and aldehyde or ketone in a retro-1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The oxide and aldehyde or ketone react again in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition or produce a relatively stable ozonide intermediate (a trioxolane).",

The resonating arrow (1) shows a resonance contributor of the diazo compound with a lone pair of electrons on the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen. The diazo compound then does a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl-containing compound (nucleophilic addition), producing a tetrahedral intermediate (2). This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups. The epoxide product is formed by an intramolecular addition reaction in which a lone pair from the oxygen attacks the carbocation (6).",

Reaction mechanism In the generally accepted mechanism proposed by Rudolf Criegee in 1953, the alkene and ozone form an intermediate molozonide in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Next, the molozonide reverts to its corresponding carbonyl oxide (also called the Criegee intermediate or Criegee zwitterion) and aldehyde or ketone in a retro-1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The oxide and aldehyde or ketone react again in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition or produce a relatively stable ozonide intermediate (a trioxolane).",

The resonating arrow (1) shows a resonance contributor of the diazo compound with a lone pair of electrons on the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen. The diazo compound then does a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl-containing compound (nucleophilic addition), producing a tetrahedral intermediate (2). This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups. The epoxide product is formed by an intramolecular addition reaction in which a lone pair from the oxygen attacks the carbocation (6).",

Its use in chemistry has been as a reagent prepared in situ for use in the synthesis of chemicals such as diaminotetrazoles, either in dilute solution or as a gas at reduced pressure. It can be synthesised at below room temperature from the reaction of sodium azide with either cyanogen chloride or cyanogen bromide, dissolved in a solvent such as acetonitrile; this reaction must be done with care due to the production from trace moisture of shock-sensitive byproducts.

A significant advantage of this reaction is that it uses relatively inexpensive carboxylic acids (or their salts) and is far less air and moisture sensitive in comparison to typical cross-coupling organometallic reagents. Furthermore, the carboxylic acid moiety is a common feature of natural products and can also be prepared by relatively benign air oxidations. Additional benefits include the broad tolerance of functional groups, as well as the capacity to avoid the use of strong bases.

(3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

The diazo compound then does a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl-containing compound (nucleophilic addition), producing a tetrahedral intermediate (2). This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups. The epoxide product is formed by an intramolecular addition reaction in which a lone pair from the oxygen attacks the carbocation (6).",

This intermediate decomposes by the evolution of nitrogen gas forming the tertiary carbocation intermediate (3). The reaction is then completed either by the reformation of the carbonyl through an 1,2-rearrangement or by the formation of the epoxide. There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5). The relative yield of each possible carbonyl is determined by the migratory preferences of the R-groups.

The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

The central phosphorus/sulfur four-membered ring dissociates to form two reactive dithiophosphine ylides (R-PS2). Much of the chemistry of Lawessons's reagent is in fact the chemistry of this reactive intermediate. In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

The cumene itself is of relatively little value in and of itself, and is typically only bought and sold by chemical companies. Example Methane chlorination Methane chlorination is a chain reaction. If only the products and reactants are analyzed, the result is: CH4 + 4Cl2->CCl4 +4HCl However, this reaction has 3 intermediate reactants which are formed during a sequence of 4 irreversible second order reactions until we arrive at the final product.

Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture.

The compound is soluble in common organic solvents. Preparation CpCo(CO)2 was first reported in 1954 by Piper, Cotton, and Wilkinson who produced it by the reaction of cobalt carbonyl with cyclopentadiene. It is prepared commercially by the same method: Co2(CO)8 + 2 C5H6 â 2 C5H5Co(CO)2 + H2 + 4 CO Alternatively, it is generated by the high pressure carbonylation of bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt (cobaltocene) at elevated temperature and pressures: Co(C5H5)2 + 2 CO â C5H5Co(CO)2 + \"C5H5\" The compound is identified by strong bands in its IR spectrum at 2030 and 1960 cmâ1.",

Carbonylations produce organic carbonyls, i.e., compounds that contain the C=O functional group such as aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and esters. Carbonylations are the basis of many types of reactions, including hydroformylation and Reppe Chemistry. These reactions require metal catalysts, which bind and activate the CO.

Normally written as COS as a chemical formula that does not imply its structure, it is a colourless flammable gas with an unpleasant odor. It is a linear molecule consisting of a carbonyl group double bonded to a sulfur atom. Carbonyl sulfide can be considered to be intermediate between carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide, both of which are valence isoelectronic with it. Carbonyl sulfide decomposes in the presence of humidity and bases to carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. This compound is found to catalyze the formation of peptides from amino acids. This finding is an extension of the MillerâUrey experiment and it is suggested that carbonyl sulfide played a significant role in the origin of life.",

This was shown experimentally and using ab initio calculations. A kinetic and thermodynamic product are both possible, but the thermodynamic product is more favorable. The kinetic product arises from a DielsâAlder reaction, while a cheletropic reaction gives rise to a more thermodynamically stable product. The cheletropic pathway is favored because it gives rise to a more stable five-membered ring adduct. The scheme below shows the difference between the two products, the path to the right shows the more stable thermodynamic product, while the path to the left shows the kinetic product.

The production of each of these occurs at different rates and the ratios of these also change over time. It is well known that the dehydration of the cis isomer is 30 times faster than the trans isomer. It then appears that the reaction proceeds mainly by a trans mechanism and, following the Zaitsev rule, 1-methylcyclohexene is preferentially formed in the early stages of the reaction. Indeed, if only about 10% of the total distillate is collected as the first fraction, one finds that the alkene is about 93% l-methylcyclohexene: at the end of the distillation one finds a value as low as 55% of l-methyl isomer. From these results, the phenomenon of the Evelyn effect can be observed and a conclusion can be drawn that a change of mechanism occurs somewhere during the synthesis.",

Thus, methods were needed that produced consistent products of a controllable length. Before 1985, metal salts and other covalent compounds were investigated as potential initiators. However, these showed limited upside and so research then turned to other methods. Finally, in 1998, T.J Deming discovered organometallic initiators as a method to produce low dispersity products. By using a complex of nickel and cyclooctadiene, Deming was able to produce a product that showed a dispersity of about 1.15, which is very good for most reactions. The organometal complex works by incorporating nickel into the NCA ring and creating a temporary 6 membered ring instead of 5. This produced a living polymerization which allows high control of molecular weight and length of the product. Further research involved using iron and cobalt as initiators; however, only cobalt showed similar, if not better, efficacy than",

The non-protein component is a very potent DNA-damaging agent; However it is extremely unstable and the role of the protein is to protect it and release it to the target DNA. Opening of the epoxide under reductive conditions present in cells creates favorable conditions for a Masamune-Bergman cyclization, leading to formation of benzyne, followed by DNA strand cleavage. Another important member of the chromoprotein group of natural products is kedarcidin. As a medicine it is among the most potent, and in Japan only it has been used against liver cancer clinically.

First, treating fragment A with n-butyllithium formed carbon anion that attacked the alkyliodide part of fragment B to generate intermediate C (step 1). Then a 3, 4-dihydropyran derivative D was formed through base-mediated elimination reaction on intermediate C (step 2). The protecting group on 1, 3-diol moiety in intermediate D was removed by acid treatment to give the diol product E (step 3). The spiroketal product G was generated via intramolecular ketal formation reaction. This multistep tandem reaction greatly simplified the construction of this complex spiroketal structure and eased the path towards the total synthesis of routiennocin.

Compound XII was formed from condensation of [carbonyl-14C-]-2-hydroxy-acetophenone with dimethyl oxylate and ring closure. Hydrogenolytical debenzylation and hydrochloric acid created the final product. Third Reaction Scheme The third reaction involved intermediate XVII undergoing acylation using acetyl chloride. Deacetylation and debenzylation were then implemented with HCI. Pd/C was used in the deacetylation step and Pd/C was used in the debenzylation step. Mechanism of Action",

The non-protein component is a very potent DNA-damaging agent; However it is extremely unstable and the role of the protein is to protect it and release it to the target DNA. Opening of the epoxide under reductive conditions present in cells creates favorable conditions for a Masamune-Bergman cyclization, leading to formation of benzyne, followed by DNA strand cleavage.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

The catalytic systems based on CGCs, however, display incorporation of alpha-olefin comonomers to a greater extend than comparable metallocene based systems. This superiority of CGCs in copolymerisation reactions is ascribed to (i) a high accessibility of the reactive centre and (ii) a low tendency of the bulk polymer chain to undergo chain transfer reactions.

Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

Mathematical modelling of chemical reaction networks usually focuses on what happens to the concentrations of the various chemicals involved as time passes. Following the example above, let represent the concentration of H2 in the surrounding air, represent the concentration of O2, represent the concentration of H2O, and so on. Since all of these concentrations will not in general remain constant, they can be written as a function of time e.g. , etc. These variables can then be combined into a vector",
