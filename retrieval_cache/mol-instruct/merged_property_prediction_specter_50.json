Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular.

Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center.

Bonding, antibonding, and nonbonding MOs When atomic orbitals interact, the resulting molecular orbital can be of three types: bonding, antibonding, or nonbonding. Bonding MOs:",

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs. Consequently, elements of the relevant representation matrix of the DM (commonly referred to as the charge-bond order (CBO) matrix) are generally determined by sums over all occupied MOs of products of respective coefficients of the above-specified linear combinations (MO LCAO coefficients), i.e. by all electrons of the given system.

Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result.

Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field.

If that were the case, the 3d-orbital would have the same energy as the 3p-orbital, as it does in hydrogen, yet it clearly does not. There is no special reason why the Fe ion should have the same electron configuration as the chromium atom, given that iron has two more protons in its nucleus than chromium, and that the chemistry of the two species is very different. Melrose and Eric Scerri have analyzed the changes of orbital energy with orbital occupations in terms of the two-electron repulsion integrals of the Hartree-Fock method of atomic structure calculation. More recently Scerri has argued that contrary to what is stated in the vast majority of sources including the title of his previous article on the subject, 3d orbitals rather than 4s are in fact preferentially occupied.",

Electrocyclic reactions An electrocyclic reaction is a pericyclic reaction involving the net loss of a pi bond and creation of a sigma bond with formation of a ring. This reaction proceeds through either a conrotatory or disrotatory mechanism. In the conrotatory ring opening of cyclobutene, there are two electrons moving suprafacially (on the pi bond) and two moving antarafacially (on the sigma bond). This means there is one 4q + 2 suprafacial system and no 4r antarafacial system; thus the conrotatory process is thermally allowed by the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules.",

Bonds interact with each other in molecules to determine the molecular properties. Interactions of molecules give rise to chemical reactions. Electrons control atoms, bonds, and molecules. The behavior of electrons is simply and effectively represented by orbitals, which contain wave properties, i.e., phase and amplitude. In our chemical orbital theory we consider the interactions of the orbitals of atoms, bonds and molecules. The elements of the chemical orbital theory are separated into three groups: (1) interactions of two orbitals, (2) interactions of three orbitals, and (3) cyclic interactions of more than two orbitals. Here, general aspects of the interactions of two orbitals are summarized to show the background of this volume and assist nonspecialists to read the following chapters. Among the keywords are: phase and amplitude of orbitals, strength of orbital interactions, electron delocalization, electron localization, exchange repulsion, ionization energy, electronic spectrum, frontier orbitals, reactivity, selectivity, orbital symmetry, and so on. The remaining elements of the chemical orbital theory, i.e., an orbital mixing rule for the three-orbital interactions and an orbital phase theory for the cyclic interactions, are introduced briefly.",

The atomic orbital energy correlates with electronegativity as more electronegative atoms hold their electrons more tightly, lowering their energies. Sharing of molecular orbitals between atoms is more important when the atomic orbitals have comparable energy; when the energies differ greatly the orbitals tend to be localized on one atom and the mode of bonding becomes ionic. A second condition for overlapping atomic orbitals is that they have the same symmetry.",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

For both systems, the predictions from MO-ADK are also compared to results from SFA. Refer to Table IV, we note that the difference in binding energies between HOMO and HOMO-1 in CO is 2.9 eV, and 3.5 eV for HCl. First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

Let us present S in the following form:\nS = A\u00b5 \u22121/2 a \u2212a U (x) \u2212 E dx, where A\nis a numerical constant and the square root depends on \u00b5 via E:\nd\u03c9 0 inv d\u00b5 = \u03c9 0 inv 1 2\u00b5 \u2212 dS d\u00b5 (27a) = \u03c9 0 inv 1 2\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202S \u2202\u00b5 \u2212 \u2202S \u2202E \u2202E \u2202\u00b5 .(27b)\nIt is easy to see that \u2202S/\u2202\u00b5 = \u2212S/2\u00b5. The value of the third term in Eq. (27b) depends on the form of the potential barrier:\n\u2202S \u2202E = \u2212 q 4 S U max \u2212 E ,(28)\nwhere for a square barrier q = 1, and for a triangular barrier q = 3. For a more realistic barrier shape, q \u2248 2.\n\nUsing the parametrization (24) to determine U max we get:\n\u03b4\u03c9 0 inv \u03c9 0 inv \u2248 \u03b4\u00b5 2\u00b5 1 + S + S 2 \u03c9 vib U max \u2212 E = 4.4 \u03b4\u00b5 \u00b5 ,(29)\nwhich is close to the numerical result (25). We see that the inversion frequency of NH 3 is an order of magnitude more sensitive to the change of \u00b5 than typical vibrational frequencies. The reason for this is clear from Eq. (29): it is the large value of the action S for the tunneling process.",

H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion.

The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs. Consequently, elements of the relevant representation matrix of the DM (commonly referred to as the charge-bond order (CBO) matrix) are generally determined by sums over all occupied MOs of products of respective coefficients of the above-specified linear combinations (MO LCAO coefficients), i.e. by all electrons of the given system. This implies both the CBO matrix P and the resulting charge distribution to belong to collective properties of molecules (Section 3).

Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital.

This reaction proceeds through either a conrotatory or disrotatory mechanism. In the conrotatory ring opening of cyclobutene, there are two electrons moving suprafacially (on the pi bond) and two moving antarafacially (on the sigma bond). This means there is one 4q + 2 suprafacial system and no 4r antarafacial system; thus the conrotatory process is thermally allowed by the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules.",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 .

In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

The acronyms stand for highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, respectively. HOMO\u2013LUMO gap The energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO is termed the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap. HOMO and LUMO are sometimes collectively called the frontier orbitals, such as in the frontier molecular orbital theory. The difference in energy between these two frontier orbitals can be used to predict the strength and stability of transition metal complexes, as well as the colors they produce in solution.

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

But for pedagogical reason we will stick to the simple model at this stage. Going through the symmetry requirements, we find that we can write the full wavefunction as:\n\u03c8 g,u (r) = 1 \u221a 2 \u00b1 2S (\u03c8 1s (r A ) \u00b1 \u03c8 1s (r B ))(16)\nThe contribution S describes the overlap of the two atomic orbitals\nS = dr\u03c8 * 1s (r A )\u03c8 1s (r B )(17)\nWe can then evaluate the energy of the two states through the variational principle:\nE g,u = \u03c8 g,u |\u0124 e |\u03c8 g,u(18)= 1 2 \u00b1 2S ( \u03c8 A | \u00b1 \u03c8 B |)\u0124 e (|\u03c8 A \u00b1 |\u03c8 B ) (19) = E AA \u00b1 E AB 1 \u00b1 S (20)(21)\nThe resulting energy surfaces are shown in Fig. 3.

Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular.

The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams.

Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

Using the valence bond approximation this can be understood by the type of bonds between the atoms that make up the molecule. When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, the atomic orbitals of each atom are said to combine in a process called orbital hybridisation. The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised. An understanding of the wavelike behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules is the subject of quantum chemistry. Isomers",

Molecular orbitals are approximate solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electrons in the electric field of the molecule's atomic nuclei. However calculating the orbitals directly from this equation is far too intractable a problem. Instead they are obtained from the combination of atomic orbitals, which predict the location of an electron in an atom. A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s). Most commonly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method), especially in qualitative or very approximate usage.

The alternative molecular orbital (MO) theory was born in the late 1920s. The presence of two seemingly different descriptions of molecules by the two theories led to struggles between the main proponents, Linus Pauling and Robert Mulliken, and their supporters. Until the 1950s, VB theory was dominant, and then it was eclipsed by MO theory. The struggles will be discussed, as well as the new dawn of VB theory, and its future.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well. With its description of the electron wave functions in molecules as delocalized molecular orbitals that possess the same symmetry",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 .

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. Concerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926. Translational energies The translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression: where is the mass of the molecule and is its velocity. Rotational energies Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is where is the angular momentum is the moment of inertia of the molecule",

This is followed by a personal autobiography illustrating how I have led a life of serendipity with no real sense of purpose. Chance events have shaped my life. The algorithms for which I am best known are briefly discussed. Then highlights from the many applications of theory to excited states, bonding in ice, spin properties and magnetism, (e,2e) shake-up spectra, and organic reactions are mentioned. This wide range of applications is mostly due to accidental collaboration with colleagues who sought my help. My real interest was in developing methods which could address these problems.",

Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system (bound state) composed of two or more atoms. Polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species, i.e., short-lived assemblies (resonances) of electrons and nuclei, such as radicals, molecular ions, Rydberg molecules, transition states, van der Waals complexes, or systems of colliding atoms as in Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.

This separation defines two major fields for quantum chemistry, electronic structure theory and the corresponding electronic Hamiltonian (in atomic units): \nH el = \u2212 n e i=1 1 2 r i + n e i=1\nwith the r i electronic and R n nuclear positions and electric charges, Z n ; and nuclear motion theory with the Hamiltonian for the motion of the atomic nuclei (or rovibrational Hamiltonian):\nH nuc =T(\u03c1) +V,( 2 )\nwhereT(\u03c1) is the rovibrational kinetic energy operator and the potential energy,V, which is called the potential energy surface and it is obtained from the eigenvalues of Equation (1) computed at different positions of the atomic nuclei. Within this framework, a variety of molecular properties are derived from the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, Equation (1), and an effective combination of the quantum mechanics of electrons with classical electronic properties of identifiable nuclei and quantum mechanics for nuclear motions, Equation (2).\n\nSeveral chemical concepts gain a theoretical background from this construct, most importantly the potential energy surface (PES) is defined. Its minimum structure (or structures if it has several local minima) defines the equilibrium structure, which is a purely mathematical construct resulting from the separability approximation but it is usually identified with the classical molecular structure. Then, the nuclei are re-quantised to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the atomic nuclei, Equation (2), to calculate rovibrational states, resonances, reaction rates, etc.",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s).

Assign a point group to the molecule. 2. Look up the shapes of the SALCs. 3. Arrange the SALCs of each molecular fragment in increasing order of energy, first noting whether they stem from s, p, or d orbitals (and put them in the order s < p < d), and then their number of internuclear nodes. 4. Combine SALCs of the same symmetry type from the two fragments, and from N SALCs form N molecular orbitals. 5. Estimate the relative energies of the molecular orbitals from considerations of overlap and relative energies of the parent orbitals, and draw the levels on a molecular orbital energy level diagram (showing the origin of the orbitals). 6. Confirm, correct, and revise this qualitative order by carrying out a molecular orbital calculation by using commercial software. Bonding in molecular orbitals Orbital degeneracy",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs. Consequently, elements of the relevant representation matrix of the DM (commonly referred to as the charge-bond order (CBO) matrix) are generally determined by sums over all occupied MOs of products of respective coefficients of the above-specified linear combinations (MO LCAO coefficients), i.e. by all electrons of the given system.

Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory.",

Heteronuclear diatomics In heteronuclear diatomic molecules, mixing of atomic orbitals only occurs when the electronegativity values are similar. In carbon monoxide (CO, isoelectronic with dinitrogen) the oxygen 2s orbital is much lower in energy than the carbon 2s orbital and therefore the degree of mixing is low. The electron configuration 1\u03c321\u03c3*22\u03c322\u03c3*21\u03c043\u03c32 is identical to that of nitrogen. The g and u subscripts no longer apply because the molecule lacks a center of symmetry.",

The reduction in energy of these electrons is the driving force for chemical bond formation.

The resulting electron configuration can be described in terms of bond type, parity and occupancy for example dihydrogen 1\u03c3g2.

The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

Moreover, the DM is a unique characteristic [1,2] of the given system in contrast to NCMOs and/or LMOs. The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs. Consequently, elements of the relevant representation matrix of the DM (commonly referred to as the charge-bond order (CBO) matrix) are generally determined by sums over all occupied MOs of products of respective coefficients of the above-specified linear combinations (MO LCAO coefficients), i.e. by all electrons of the given system. This implies both the CBO matrix P and the resulting charge distribution to belong to collective properties of molecules (Section 3). That is why applicability of classical principles of locality, additivity and transferability both to separate elements of the CBO matrix and to the overall charge distribution is among natural expectations.",

Heitler and London's method was extended by the American theoretical physicist John C. Slater and the American theoretical chemist Linus Pauling to become the valence-bond (VB) [or Heitler\u2013London\u2013Slater\u2013Pauling (HLSP)] method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists' drawings of bonds. It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of an atom combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed, incorporating the two key concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance.

When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full \u03c3 (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty \u03c3* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect.

Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present.

The term 1\u03c0 represents the two electrons in the two degenerate \u03c0*-orbitals (antibonding).

It was proposed early in the 20th century. In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) models to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.",

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

Hoffman's work focused on creating a set of four pericyclic reactions in organic chemistry, based on orbital symmetry, which he coauthored with Robert Burns Woodward, entitled \"The Conservation of Orbital Symmetry.\"",

Using the valence bond approximation this can be understood by the type of bonds between the atoms that make up the molecule. When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, the atomic orbitals of each atom are said to combine in a process called orbital hybridisation. The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised. An understanding of the wavelike behavior of electrons in atoms and molecules is the subject of quantum chemistry. Isomers",

Some orbitals (e.g. px and py orbitals from the fluorine in HF) may not have any other orbitals to combine with and become non-bonding molecular orbitals. In the HF example, the px and py orbitals remain px and py orbitals in shape but when viewed as molecular orbitals are thought of as non-bonding. The energy of the orbital does not depend on the length of any bond within the molecule. Its occupation neither increases nor decreases the stability of the molecule, relative to the atoms, since its energy is the same in the molecule as in one of the atoms.

Then, the electrons to be placed in the molecular orbitals are slotted in one by one, keeping in mind the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity (only 2 electrons, having opposite spins, per orbital; place as many unpaired electrons on one energy level as possible before starting to pair them).

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

This mixture was treated with 3 equivalents of pTsOH until the 1 H NMR signals shifted toward higher frequency, confirming Z to E isomerization (entry 5, Scheme S4). When the solution had the E isomer as the major product, the effect of protonation by irradiation with 400 nm light for 10 minutes resulted in no further isomerization of the Z isomer (entry 6, Scheme S4). Next, in our study, we tested the compound using 445 nm light and determined the complete transformation to the E isomer (entry 7, Scheme S4). Subsequently, the solution was neutralized with 7 equivalents of triethylamine, and it was irradiated again with 400 nm light for 10 minutes, obtaining a high ratio of the Z isomer (entry 9, Scheme S4), thus completing the operation cycle.

This demonstrates that mid-gap conductance ratios are independent of the size of the HOMO-LUMO gap, even though the absolute values of the conductances are gap dependent. Equation (5) reveals that for mid-gap transport, constructive interference occurs when the HOMO \u03c8 H (r i )\u03c8 H (r i' ) and LUMO \u03c8 L (r i )\u03c8 L (r i' ) products have opposite signs, whereas QI is destructive when they have the same sign.

For both systems, the predictions from MO-ADK are also compared to results from SFA.

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion.

In a simple diatomic molecule such as hydrogen fluoride (chemical formula: HF), one atom may have many more electrons than the other. A sigma bonding orbital is created between the atomic orbitals with like symmetry. Some orbitals (e.g. px and py orbitals from the fluorine in HF) may not have any other orbitals to combine with and become non-bonding molecular orbitals. In the HF example, the px and py orbitals remain px and py orbitals in shape but when viewed as molecular orbitals are thought of as non-bonding. The energy of the orbital does not depend on the length of any bond within the molecule. Its occupation neither increases nor decreases the stability of the molecule, relative to the atoms, since its energy is the same in the molecule as in one of the atoms. For example, there are two rigorously non-bonding orbitals that are occupied in the ground state of",

Molecular Orbital Theory\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in a molecule in terms of combinations of the atomic wave functions. The resulting molecular orbitals may extend over all the atoms in the molecule. Bonding molecular orbitals are formed by in-phase combinations of atomic wave functions, and electrons in these orbitals stabilize a molecule. Antibonding molecular orbitals result from out-of-phase combinations of atomic wave functions and electrons in these orbitals make a molecule less stable. Molecular orbitals located along an internuclear axis are called $\\sigma$ MOs. They can be formed from $s$ orbitals or from $p$ orbitals oriented in an end-to-end fashion. Molecular orbitals formed from $p$ orbitals oriented in a side-by-side fashion have electron density on opposite sides of the internuclear axis and are called $\\pi$ orbitals.\n\nWe can describe the electronic structure of diatomic molecules by applying molecular orbital theory to the valence electrons of the atoms. Electrons fill molecular orbitals following the same rules that apply to filling atomic orbitals; Hund's rule and the Aufbau principle tell us that lower-energy orbitals will fill first, electrons will spread out before they pair up, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins. Materials with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic and attracted to a magnetic field, while those with all-paired electrons are diamagnetic and repelled by a magnetic field. Correctly predicting the magnetic properties of molecules is in advantage of molecular orbital theory over Lewis structures and valence bond theory.",

Different shells contain different numbers and kinds of orbitals, and each orbital within a shell can be occupied by two electrons. The first shell contains only a single $s$ orbital, denoted $1 s$, and thus holds only 2 electrons. The second shell contains one $2 s$ orbital and three $2 p$ orbitals and thus holds a total of 8 electrons. The third shell contains a $3 s$ orbital, three $3 p$ orbitals, and five $3 d$ orbitals, for a total capacity of 18 electrons. These orbital groupings and their energy levels are shown in FIGURE 1.5.\n\n\nFIGURE 1.5 Energy levels of electrons in an atom. The first shell holds a maximum of 2 electrons in one $1 s$ orbital; the second shell holds a maximum of 8 electrons in one $2 s$ and three $2 p$ orbitals; the third shell holds a maximum of 18 electrons in one $3 s$, three $3 p$, and $3 d$ orbitals; and so on. The two electrons in each orbital are represented by five up and down arrows, $\\uparrow \\downarrow$. Although not shown, the energy level of the $4 s$ orbital falls between $3 p$ and $3 d$.\n\nThe three different $p$ orbitals within a given shell are oriented in space along mutually perpendicular directions, denoted $p_{\\mathrm{x}}, p_{\\mathrm{y}}$, and $p_{\\mathrm{z}}$. As shown in FIGURE 1.6, the two lobes of each $p$ orbital are separated by a region of zero electron density called a node. Furthermore, the two orbital regions separated by the node have different algebraic signs, + and -, in the wave function, as represented by the different colors in FIGURE 1.4 and FIGURE 1.6. As we'll see in Section 1.11, these algebraic signs for different orbital lobes have important consequences with respect to chemical bonding and chemical reactivity.\n\n\nA $2 p_{\\mathrm{x}}$ orbital\n\n\nA $2 p_{\\mathrm{y}}$ orbital",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected.

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 .

(a) The black curve shows the transmission coefficient for molecule b of Fig. 3. (b) The blue dashed curve shows the transmission coefficient for molecule a of Fig. 3.''Therefore, the first two paragraphs of Section III should read: ''So far the discussion has focused on tight-binding representations of the molecules shown inFig. 7. For molecules (a and b) containing two carbonyl groups,Fig. 8shows DFT results for the transmission coefficients (see Methods for more details). In common with the tight binding results ofFig. 4, both a and b show alternating destructive interference features. In the case of a, such a feature occurs between the LUMO and LUMO+1, whereas in the case of b, they occur between the HOMO and LUMO and between LUMO+2 and LUMO+3. On the other hand for both molecules, destructive interference features appear near E = \u00c02.4 eV, which are almost independent of connectivity, signaling the presence of a Fano resonance.''The Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers.",

The difference in energy between these two frontier orbitals can be used to predict the strength and stability of transition metal complexes, as well as the colors they produce in solution. Semiconductors The HOMO level is to organic semiconductors roughly what the maximum valence band is to inorganic semiconductors and quantum dots. The same analogy can be made between the LUMO level and the conduction band minimum.

We correlate only the valence electrons and use state-average natural orbitals obtained with a preliminary calculation at the CIPSI level. For each state, we compute the energy with only one CSF, and on top of this configuration, we perform a CAS-CI calculation restricted to the \u03c3 and the \u03c0 orbitals in a CAS-\u03c3 and CAS-\u03c0, respectively. The reference FCI excitation energy in this basis and the associated confidence interval are computed following the scheme presented in ref 38 rather than extrapolating the variational energies of the individual states in the limit of the PT2 energy correction going to zero. Indeed, the uncertainties of the extrapolated FCI energies of both states are larger than the uncertainty on the estimated excitation energy computed with this scheme. Since the CC3 estimate for CN3 and CN5 is in excellent agreement with the FCI value, we use the CC3 excitation energy as reference for CN7. We note that, because of the use of the simple 6-31G basis set, the FCI and CC3 excitation energies are much higher than the more accurate results presented above, but this is not relevant for the present discussion.\n\nFor the CN3 molecule, the excitation energy obtained with a single CSF for each state is 8.91 eV, namely, higher by 1.4 eV than the FCI result. The CAS-\u03c0 calculation corrects only 60% of the error, indicating that the \u03c3 orbitals also play an important role in the stabilization of the excited state. Similarly, the excitation energy obtained with the CAS-\u03c3 improves the excitation energy with respect to the single CSF by recovering about 31% of the error. These results indicate the importance of both \u03c3 and \u03c0 orbitals in the calculation of the excitation energy of CN3.",

The HOMO product \u03c8 H (r 1 )\u03c8 H (r 8 ) is negative, whereas the LUMO product \u03c8 L (r 1 )\u03c8 L (r 8 ) is positive, so this connectivity corresponds to constructive inter-orbital QI and \u03c3 1,8 will be high.

At both levels of theory, the HOMO is delocalized across the full molecule and has slightly more electron density on the central porphyrin ring than on the terminal porphyrin rings, whereas the LUMO is localized primarily on the central porphyrin ring and has very little electron density on the terminal porphyrin rings. These results for several prototypical systems show that the INDO/S model can produce accurate electronic structures for a wide variety of molecular systems. 4.2 | INDO/CIS, INDO/CISD, and INDO/MRCI for small molecules To show the applicability of the various INDO/CI approaches available in MOPAC2016, I examine the excited states of linear polyenes (Figure 2A; n = 1-5); the smallest of these molecules is trans-1,-3-butadiene, discussed in the previous section. In these molecules, the first excited state with strong one-photon absorption has B u symmetry (1B u state) and dominantly HOMO ! LUMO character, and the first excited state with strong two-photon absorption has A g symmetry (2A g state) and is a linear combination of HOMO -1 ! LUMO, HOMO ! LUMO +1, and the double excitation HOMO, HOMO ! LUMO, LUMO. For many \u03c0-conjugated molecules, the absorbing excited states all have dominant singly excited character, and INDO/ CIS is adequate to represent the absorption spectra. The large doubly excited character of the polyene 2A g state makes polyenes a good test of the INDO/CISD and INDO/MRCI methods in particular.",

In the kinetic theory of gases, the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition.

A molecule may be homonuclear, that is, it consists of atoms of one chemical element, e.g. two atoms in the oxygen molecule (O2); or it may be heteronuclear, a chemical compound composed of more than one element, e.g. water (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; H2O). Atoms and complexes connected by non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds, are typically not considered single molecules.",

The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. Concerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926.

He figured out from the nature of the noble gases that the atoms of elements having eight electrons (in the valence shell) would be the most stable. He called the filled shells as 'kernels' that would give remarkable stability to the atom. A shell with less than eight electrons would make the atom reactive. He did realise that helium would have only two electrons and accepted that as a stable arrangement. For larger atoms, he proposed that the electronic configuration would consist of a cube(s) inside a cube (in addition to the innermost kernel comprising two electrons). Based on the number of electrons being less than or more than eight, he could classify the elements as electropositive or electronegative. He realised that hydrogen would be electropositive in HCl (chlorine would have eight electrons in its shell) and electronegative in LiH (both H and Li would have two electrons each in their shells).\n\nWhat was more interesting was his analytic conclusion that a pair of electrons shared by two atoms would constitute a chemical bond. Although he never used the term covalent bond, he argued that one pair of shared electrons would constitute a single bond and two pairs would make a double bond and three a triple bond. He could not anticipate any higher bond order. Since his model called for the arrangement of electrons in an atom at the corners of a cube, he invoked sharing of an edge between two cubes to form a single bond and sharing a face to form a double bond between two atoms. He knew that his model would not help explain the formation of a triple bond.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

The reduction in energy of these electrons is the driving force for chemical bond formation. Whenever mixing for an atomic orbital is not possible for reasons of symmetry or energy, a non-bonding MO is created, which is often quite similar to and has energy level equal or close to its constituent AO, thus not contributing to bonding energetics. The resulting electron configuration can be described in terms of bond type, parity and occupancy for example dihydrogen 1\u03c3g2.

When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full \u03c3 (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty \u03c3* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.",

The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised.

The NBO analysis shows a lone pair on the P atom with 54.2 % contribution from 3 s orbital and 45.6 % contribution from 3p orbitals. The lone pair with relatively less %p character can be correlated with a significantly bent C\u00c0 P\u00c0 B backbone. The extent of bending increases as the halogen is changed from Cl to I (see below). HOMO is a \u03c0-type MO delocalized over the N\u00c0 C\u00c0 P\u00c0 B\u00c0 X backbone with a major coefficient from the P center. It can be formed by donating a lone pair of electrons from the P center to the antibonding C ! N and B ! X \u03c0*-MOs. However, it is seen as a strong secondorder interaction from P\u00c0 C \u03c0-NBO to partially filled p-type orbital on B in the NBO analysis. The bond occupancy from the NBO calculations indicates that the P-atom contributes 66 % to the P=C \u03c0 interaction. This suggests a polarized \u03c0 bond with a larger contribution on the P atom. The MO and NBO analyses corroborated well with the very low Wiberg bond indices for the C carbene \u00c0 P (1.28-1.35), P\u00c0 B (1.31-1.41) and C carbene \u00c0 N (1.29-1.32) bonds. Note that these Wiberg bond indices are lower than the C carbene \u00c0 N Wiberg bond index of free cAAC (1.52; see below). The difference in electronegativity also induces polarity in the C carbene \u00c0 P, P\u00c0 B and C carbene \u00c0 N bonds, reducing the bond index values. These bond index values support the partial double bond character observed in these bonds. The overall high positive group charge on cAAC (0.14-0.18) implies that \u03c3donation from cAAC is higher than the \u03c0-back donation from the P center. The NBO analysis shows considerable polarization of the P\u00c0 C cAAC \u03c3-MO and \u03c0-MO in opposite directions (Table S8), thus indicating the inversely polarized phosphaalkene nature. However, the net polarization is minimal, as seen from the natural charges on C",

In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.",

With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

In physics, the symbol F is also used in reference to free energy or Helmholtz function. Definition The Helmholtz energy is defined as where F is the Helmholtz free energy (sometimes also called A, particularly in the field of chemistry) (SI: joules, CGS: ergs), U is the internal energy of the system (SI: joules, CGS: ergs), T is the absolute temperature (kelvins) of the surroundings, modelled as a heat bath, S is the entropy of the system (SI: joules per kelvin, CGS: ergs per kelvin). The Helmholtz energy is the Legendre transformation of the internal energy U, in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable.",

Most chemists relied on the familiar thermodynamics of heat (enthalpy) of Berthelot, Ostwald, and Van\u2019t Hoff, and the calorimetric school. Heat of reaction is not, of course, a measure of the tendency of chemical changes to occur, and Lewis realized that only free energy and entropy could provide an exact chemical thermodynamics. He derived free energy from fugacity; he tried, without success, to obtain an exact expression for the entropy function, which in 1901 had not been defined at low temperatures. Richards too tried and failed, and not until Nernst succeeded in 1907 was it possible to calculate entropies unambiguously. Although Lewis\u2019 fugacity-based system did not last,",

Therefore, the heat of the reaction is a direct measure of the free energy change, . In solution chemistry, on the other hand, most chemical reactions are kept at constant pressure. Under this condition, the heat of the reaction is equal to the enthalpy change of the system. Under constant pressure and temperature, the free energy in a reaction is known as Gibbs free energy .",

He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not.

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full \u03c3 (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty \u03c3* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.",

Moreover, the DM is a unique characteristic [1,2] of the given system in contrast to NCMOs and/or LMOs. The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs. Consequently, elements of the relevant representation matrix of the DM (commonly referred to as the charge-bond order (CBO) matrix) are generally determined by sums over all occupied MOs of products of respective coefficients of the above-specified linear combinations (MO LCAO coefficients), i.e. by all electrons of the given system. This implies both the CBO matrix P and the resulting charge distribution to belong to collective properties of molecules (Section 3). That is why applicability of classical principles of locality, additivity and transferability both to separate elements of the CBO matrix and to the overall charge distribution is among natural expectations.",

Heitler and London's method was extended by the American theoretical physicist John C. Slater and the American theoretical chemist Linus Pauling to become the valence-bond (VB) [or Heitler\u2013London\u2013Slater\u2013Pauling (HLSP)] method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists' drawings of bonds. It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of an atom combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed, incorporating the two key concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance.

This reaction proceeds through either a conrotatory or disrotatory mechanism. In the conrotatory ring opening of cyclobutene, there are two electrons moving suprafacially (on the pi bond) and two moving antarafacially (on the sigma bond).

In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) models to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.",

In the case of a [1,5] shift on pentadiene, the HOMO of the sigma bond (i.e. a constructive bond) and the LUMO of butadiene on the remaining 4 carbons is observed. Assuming the reaction happens suprafacially, the shift results with the HOMO of butadiene on the 4 carbons that are not involved in the sigma bond of the product.

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised.

The presence of two seemingly different descriptions of molecules by the two theories led to struggles between the main proponents, Linus Pauling and Robert Mulliken, and their supporters. Until the 1950s, VB theory was dominant, and then it was eclipsed by MO theory. The struggles will be discussed, as well as the new dawn of VB theory, and its future.",

The NBO analysis shows a lone pair on the P atom with 54.2 % contribution from 3 s orbital and 45.6 % contribution from 3p orbitals. The lone pair with relatively less %p character can be correlated with a significantly bent C\u00c0 P\u00c0 B backbone. The extent of bending increases as the halogen is changed from Cl to I (see below). HOMO is a \u03c0-type MO delocalized over the N\u00c0 C\u00c0 P\u00c0 B\u00c0 X backbone with a major coefficient from the P center. It can be formed by donating a lone pair of electrons from the P center to the antibonding C ! N and B ! X \u03c0*-MOs. However, it is seen as a strong secondorder interaction from P\u00c0 C \u03c0-NBO to partially filled p-type orbital on B in the NBO analysis. The bond occupancy from the NBO calculations indicates that the P-atom contributes 66 % to the P=C \u03c0 interaction. This suggests a polarized \u03c0 bond with a larger contribution on the P atom. The MO and NBO analyses corroborated well with the very low Wiberg bond indices for the C carbene \u00c0 P (1.28-1.35), P\u00c0 B (1.31-1.41) and C carbene \u00c0 N (1.29-1.32) bonds. Note that these Wiberg bond indices are lower than the C carbene \u00c0 N Wiberg bond index of free cAAC (1.52; see below). The difference in electronegativity also induces polarity in the C carbene \u00c0 P, P\u00c0 B and C carbene \u00c0 N bonds, reducing the bond index values. These bond index values support the partial double bond character observed in these bonds. The overall high positive group charge on cAAC (0.14-0.18) implies that \u03c3donation from cAAC is higher than the \u03c0-back donation from the P center. The NBO analysis shows considerable polarization of the P\u00c0 C cAAC \u03c3-MO and \u03c0-MO in opposite directions (Table S8), thus indicating the inversely polarized phosphaalkene nature. However, the net polarization is minimal, as seen from the natural charges on C",

The electrons in the bonding MO's are called bonding electrons and any electrons in the antibonding orbital would be called antibonding electrons. The reduction in energy of these electrons is the driving force for chemical bond formation. Whenever mixing for an atomic orbital is not possible for reasons of symmetry or energy, a non-bonding MO is created, which is often quite similar to and has energy level equal or close to its constituent AO, thus not contributing to bonding energetics. The resulting electron configuration can be described in terms of bond type, parity and occupancy for example dihydrogen 1\u03c3g2. Alternatively it can be written as a molecular term symbol e.g. 1\u03a3g+ for dihydrogen. Sometimes, the letter n is used to designate a non-bonding orbital.

For both systems, the predictions from MO-ADK are also compared to results from SFA. Refer to Table IV, we note that the difference in binding energies between HOMO and HOMO-1 in CO is 2.9 eV, and 3.5 eV for HCl. First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

We correlate only the valence electrons and use state-average natural orbitals obtained with a preliminary calculation at the CIPSI level. For each state, we compute the energy with only one CSF, and on top of this configuration, we perform a CAS-CI calculation restricted to the \u03c3 and the \u03c0 orbitals in a CAS-\u03c3 and CAS-\u03c0, respectively. The reference FCI excitation energy in this basis and the associated confidence interval are computed following the scheme presented in ref 38 rather than extrapolating the variational energies of the individual states in the limit of the PT2 energy correction going to zero. Indeed, the uncertainties of the extrapolated FCI energies of both states are larger than the uncertainty on the estimated excitation energy computed with this scheme. Since the CC3 estimate for CN3 and CN5 is in excellent agreement with the FCI value, we use the CC3 excitation energy as reference for CN7. We note that, because of the use of the simple 6-31G basis set, the FCI and CC3 excitation energies are much higher than the more accurate results presented above, but this is not relevant for the present discussion.\n\nFor the CN3 molecule, the excitation energy obtained with a single CSF for each state is 8.91 eV, namely, higher by 1.4 eV than the FCI result. The CAS-\u03c0 calculation corrects only 60% of the error, indicating that the \u03c3 orbitals also play an important role in the stabilization of the excited state. Similarly, the excitation energy obtained with the CAS-\u03c3 improves the excitation energy with respect to the single CSF by recovering about 31% of the error. These results indicate the importance of both \u03c3 and \u03c0 orbitals in the calculation of the excitation energy of CN3.",

For both systems, the predictions from MO-ADK are also compared to results from SFA.

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

Fundamental Gaps\n\nThe fundamental gap E g of a molecule with N electrons is defined as\nE g = IP(N) \u2212 EA(N).(45)\nFollowing Eqs. (39) and (40) for the definitions of IP and EA, three self-consistent field (SCF) calculations (for the neutral molecule, cation and anion) are required to obtain the fundamental gap of a molecule. Using Eq. (41) and (42), the fundamental gap of a molecule can also be obtained by two SCF calculations (for the neutral molecule and anion).\n\nFollowing Janak's theorem [89], the fundamental gap can be approximated by the HOMO-LUMO gap [84] \n\u2206 KS = \u01eb N +1 (N) \u2212 \u01eb N (N),(46)\nand we can obtain the fundamental gap of a system using only one calculation. But from Eqs. (41), (42), (43), (45), and (46), we know that there exists a difference between the fundamental gap and HOMO-LUMO gap,\nE g = \u2206 KS + \u2206 xc .(47)\nAs previously mentioned, \u2206 xc has been shown to be close to zero for LC hybrid functionals [85], so the HOMO-LUMO gap calculated by a LC hybrid functional should be close to the fundamental gap.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the functionals on fundamental gap, we construct another database called FG115, which shares the same molecular geometries with the EA115 database. For consistency, the reference values of fundamental gaps are also obtained via the CCSD(T) calculations described in the last subsection (using Eqs. (39), (40), and (45)).\n\nTo examine the performance of density functionals, we evaluate the fundamental gaps using three different estimates, with 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis and EML(75,302) grid. The results are shown from Table IX \n\n\nF. Excitation Energies\n\nTo assess the performance of density functionals on excitation energies, we perform TDDFT calculations on five small molecules [90], which include nitrogen gas (N 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H 2 O), ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) and",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected.

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

It was proposed early in the 20th century. In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) models to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.",

Molecular orbitals are approximate solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electrons in the electric field of the molecule's atomic nuclei. However calculating the orbitals directly from this equation is far too intractable a problem. Instead they are obtained from the combination of atomic orbitals, which predict the location of an electron in an atom. A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s). Most commonly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method), especially in qualitative or very approximate usage. They are invaluable in providing a simple model of bonding in molecules, understood through molecular orbital theory.",

The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised.

The presence of two seemingly different descriptions of molecules by the two theories led to struggles between the main proponents, Linus Pauling and Robert Mulliken, and their supporters. Until the 1950s, VB theory was dominant, and then it was eclipsed by MO theory. The struggles will be discussed, as well as the new dawn of VB theory, and its future.",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states.

Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

In addition, HOMO-LUMO gap can be related to a bulk material band gap or transport gap, which is usually much smaller than fundamental gap. Examples Homonuclear diatomics Homonuclear diatomic MOs contain equal contributions from each atomic orbital in the basis set. This is shown in the homonuclear diatomic MO diagrams for H2, He2, and Li2, all of which containing symmetric orbitals. H2",

The algorithms for which I am best known are briefly discussed. Then highlights from the many applications of theory to excited states, bonding in ice, spin properties and magnetism, (e,2e) shake-up spectra, and organic reactions are mentioned. This wide range of applications is mostly due to accidental collaboration with colleagues who sought my help. My real interest was in developing methods which could address these problems.",

It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. Concerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926. Translational energies The translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression: where is the mass of the molecule and is its velocity. Rotational energies Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is where is the angular momentum is the moment of inertia of the molecule",

It is published weekly by the American Chemical Society. Before 1997 the title was simply Journal of Physical Chemistry. Owing to the ever-growing amount of research in the area, in 1997 the journal was split into Journal of Physical Chemistry A (molecular theoretical and experimental physical chemistry) and The Journal of Physical Chemistry B (solid state, soft matter, liquids, etc.). Beginning in 2007, the latter underwent a further split, with The Journal of Physical Chemistry C now being dedicated to nanotechnology, molecular electronics, and related subjects.

The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. Concerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926. Translational energies The translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression: where is the mass of the molecule and is its velocity. Rotational energies Classically, the kinetic energy of rotation is where is the angular momentum is the moment of inertia of the molecule",

The Jahn-Teller theorem essentially states that any non-linear molecule with a degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the overall energy of the complex. The latter process is called the Jahn-Teller effect; this effect was recently considered also in relation to the superconductivity mechanism in YBCO and other high temperature superconductors. The details of the Jahn-Teller effect are presented with several examples and EPR data in the basic textbook by Abragam and Bleaney (1970). 1938 \u2013 Charles Coulson makes the first accurate calculation of a molecular orbital wavefunction with the hydrogen molecule.",

This separation defines two major fields for quantum chemistry, electronic structure theory and the corresponding electronic Hamiltonian (in atomic units): \nH el = \u2212 n e i=1 1 2 r i + n e i=1\nwith the r i electronic and R n nuclear positions and electric charges, Z n ; and nuclear motion theory with the Hamiltonian for the motion of the atomic nuclei (or rovibrational Hamiltonian):\nH nuc =T(\u03c1) +V,( 2 )\nwhereT(\u03c1) is the rovibrational kinetic energy operator and the potential energy,V, which is called the potential energy surface and it is obtained from the eigenvalues of Equation (1) computed at different positions of the atomic nuclei. Within this framework, a variety of molecular properties are derived from the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, Equation (1), and an effective combination of the quantum mechanics of electrons with classical electronic properties of identifiable nuclei and quantum mechanics for nuclear motions, Equation (2).\n\nSeveral chemical concepts gain a theoretical background from this construct, most importantly the potential energy surface (PES) is defined. Its minimum structure (or structures if it has several local minima) defines the equilibrium structure, which is a purely mathematical construct resulting from the separability approximation but it is usually identified with the classical molecular structure. Then, the nuclei are re-quantised to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the atomic nuclei, Equation (2), to calculate rovibrational states, resonances, reaction rates, etc.",

(2) The total energies of atoms and molecules can be expressed rigorously in terms of just the electrostatic potentials at their nuclei that are produced by the electrons and other nuclei.

Allen, this work begins by relating the central chemical concept of electronegativity with the average binding energy of electrons in a system. The average electron binding energy, \u03c7\u0305, is in principle accessible from experiment, through photoelectron and X-ray spectroscopy. It can also be estimated theoretically. \u03c7\u0305 has a rigorous and understandable connection to the total energy. That connection defines a new kind of energy decomposition scheme. The changing total energy in a reaction has three primary contributions to it: the average electron binding energy, the nuclear-nuclear repulsion, and multielectron interactions. This partitioning allows one to gain insight into the predominant factors behind a particular energetic preference. We can conclude whether an energy change in a transformation is favored or resisted by collective changes to the binding energy of electrons, the movement of nuclei, or multielectron interactions. For example, in the classical formation of H2 from atoms, orbital interactions dominate nearly canceling nuclear-nuclear repulsion and two-electron interactions. While in electron attachment to an H atom, the multielectron interactions drive the reaction. Looking at the balance of average electron binding energy, multielectron, and nuclear-nuclear contributions one can judge when more traditional electronegativity arguments can be justifiably invoked in the rationalization of a particular chemical event.

At the age of 26 he became an Assistant Professor in theoretical chemistry, worked on X-ray crystal studies, and performed quantum mechanical calculations on molecules and atoms. Studying crystal structures and the types of bonding and coordination that occurred within them, Pauling found out that crystal structures obeyed the rules now known as Pauling's rules [16,17]. In his seminal paper \"The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry\" [17], Linus Pauling reconstructed the foundations of chemistry -for the first time he explained the structure of molecules in terms of quantum mechanics. Linus Pauling described it this way: \"From Richard C. Tolman, Harry Bateman, and other remarkable teachers at Caltech, I obtained an excellent grounding in chemistry, physics, and mathe matics, with emphasis on the old quantum theory and atomic structure. Quantum mechanics was discovered a few months after I had received my PhD degree. The Schr\u00f6dinger papers on wave mechanics were published about the time that I arrived at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (Professor Arnold Sommerfeld) at the University of Munich in April 1926. I immediately began to apply an approximate quantum mechanical treatment to the problem of the structure of atoms with many electrons and to simple molecules, making use of the treatments of the hydrogen molecule-ion and hydrogen molecule that had been formulated by \u00d8. Burrau, E.U. Condon, W. Heitler, and F. London.\n\nThese new ideas had applications to many aspects of chemistry. The applications included the nature of square, tetrahedral, and octahedral coordination complexes of metals; the stability of aromatic substances as determined by the resonance energy; the planarity of resonating and conjugated systems of single and double bonds; the secondary structures of proteins and the importance of the hydrogen bond in proteins, polynucleotides, and other substances; and the nature of interatomic forces in metals\" [18].",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

Its value is usually located between the fundamental gap (difference between ionization potential and electron affinity) and the optical gap. In addition, HOMO-LUMO gap can be related to a bulk material band gap or transport gap, which is usually much smaller than fundamental gap.

The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements).

One powerful idea, and very good approximation, is to decompose the molecule wavefunction over the atomic orbitals of its components. Going back to Fig. 1 we could make the simple Ansatz:\n\u03c8 e (r) = c 1 \u03c8 1s (r A ) + c 2 \u03c8 1s (r B )(15)\nNote, that we made a very simple Ansatz at this stage and we could decompose the system over a much larger set of excited states. But for pedagogical reason we will stick to the simple model at this stage. Going through the symmetry requirements, we find that we can write the full wavefunction as:\n\u03c8 g,u (r) = 1 \u221a 2 \u00b1 2S (\u03c8 1s (r A ) \u00b1 \u03c8 1s (r B ))(16)\nThe contribution S describes the overlap of the two atomic orbitals\nS = dr\u03c8 * 1s (r A )\u03c8 1s (r B )(17)\nWe can then evaluate the energy of the two states through the variational principle:\nE g,u = \u03c8 g,u |\u0124 e |\u03c8 g,u(18)= 1 2 \u00b1 2S ( \u03c8 A | \u00b1 \u03c8 B |)\u0124 e (|\u03c8 A \u00b1 |\u03c8 B ) (19) = E AA \u00b1 E AB 1 \u00b1 S (20)(21)\nThe resulting energy surfaces are shown in Fig. 3.

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

For both systems, the predictions from MO-ADK are also compared to results from SFA.

First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.",

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

This is followed by a personal autobiography illustrating how I have led a life of serendipity with no real sense of purpose. Chance events have shaped my life. The algorithms for which I am best known are briefly discussed. Then highlights from the many applications of theory to excited states, bonding in ice, spin properties and magnetism, (e,2e) shake-up spectra, and organic reactions are mentioned. This wide range of applications is mostly due to accidental collaboration with colleagues who sought my help. My real interest was in developing methods which could address these problems.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.",

According to QTAIM, molecular structure is revealed by the stationary points of the electron density together with the gradient paths of the electron density that originate and terminate at these points.

The most obvious is when the nuclei are light, as with hydrogen.Yang et al. (2023) note: \"considering the high mobility of light hydrogen atoms, the non-adiabatic coupling of different electronic states beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is expected to be prominent\" (p. 2). Such coupling gives rise to conical intersections between energy surfaces that are used to understand reaction pathways(Baer 2006). Much of current work in quantum chemistry goes beyond BO by considering the interactions between electronic and nuclear vibrational motion which leads to the coupling of different energy states of molecules(Yarkony 2012). See alsoSibaev et al. (2020);Agostini and Curchod (2022) \nAs explained below, discreteness of the bound state spectrum requires transforming to a centre of mass frame.\nThis paper is not focused on the work of Sutcliffe and Woolley, which is a critique ofBorn and Huang (1954), and does not fully detail their position. We do claim that justifying Born's and Huang's approach requires an assumption of (quantum) localization, which their text inadequately distinguishes from clamping.\nOne idealization has already been made; as discussed in \u00a73, a total kinetic energy due to the velocity of the molecule as a whole should be subtracted.\nHere we make the important idealisation that the spectrum is discrete, which applies at many points in the following.\nThus contrast (3), with (2); the former expresses a function over R m \u00d7 R n , while the latter expresses a continuous infinity of equations for x 2 wavefunctions, one for each value of x 1 . The use, in \u03c8 a , of a comma in former versus a semi-colon in the latter indicates just this difference.\nThe following arguments are presented without careful attention to the distinction between x 1parameterized families of wavefunctions and operators on the one hand, and their direct integrals on the other. They are best read as equations relating the corresponding differential operators and functions in the position representation, which is indifferent to the distinction",

However calculating the orbitals directly from this equation is far too intractable a problem. Instead they are obtained from the combination of atomic orbitals, which predict the location of an electron in an atom. A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s).

This tool is very well suited for simple diatomic molecules such as dihydrogen, dioxygen, and carbon monoxide but becomes more complex when discussing even comparatively simple polyatomic molecules, such as methane.

According to physicist and physical chemist Erich H\u00fcckel, the first quantitative use of molecular orbital theory was the 1929 paper of Lennard-Jones. This paper predicted a triplet ground state for the dioxygen molecule which explained its paramagnetism (see ) before valence bond theory, which came up with its own explanation in 1931. The word orbital was introduced by Mulliken in 1932. By 1933, the molecular orbital theory had been accepted as a valid and useful theory.",

H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion.

He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well. With its description of the electron wave functions in molecules as delocalized molecular orbitals that possess the same symmetry",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

Heitler and London's method was extended by the American theoretical physicist John C. Slater and the American theoretical chemist Linus Pauling to become the valence-bond (VB) [or Heitler\u2013London\u2013Slater\u2013Pauling (HLSP)] method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists' drawings of bonds. It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of an atom combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed, incorporating the two key concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance.

They can be made to resemble literature results even more closely by recognising that coupling a molecular core to external electrodes introduces level broadening, whose generic effect can be captured by introducing a small positive imaginary term i\u03b7 into the denominators of equation (10), which now becomes (13) Finally, as shown in Fig. 1, molecules possess many orbitals (labelled n=0, +/-1, +/-2,\u2026. etc, with energies E n ), beyond a simple HOMO (corresponding to n=0) and LUMO (corresponding to n=1). In this case equation (7) must be modified and takes the form (14) To estimate the contribution for these other MOs, consider the case where E F coincides with the centre of the HOMO-LUMO gap. In that case, if the level spacing is approximately constant, then E n = (2n-1)\u03b4 and equation (14) becomes (15) As an example, for a molecule with four MOs, this becomes Hence the contributions from the LUMO+1 and HOMO-1 are on the scale of one third of the contributions from the HOMO and LUMO and in general cannot be neglected. In practice, if the HOMO and LUMO exhibit perfect destructive interference at certain energy \u03b5 F = \u03b1 ii' and then the contributions from other orbitals may either shift the energy at which destructive interference occurs or may eliminate the destructive QI completely.",

This factor-of-thirty gap between the fundamental limit and the best molecules is called the Kuzyk quantum gap. Nobody understands the cause of this gap, but there is no reason to believe that it is of a fundamental nature. It is therefore likely that new approaches to synthetic chemistry may find ways to make better molecules. While the gap is breachable, the Kuzyk limit is not. Given that the Kuzyk limit is based directly on quantum mechanics, a breaching of the limit would mean that there are problems with quantum theory.",

This demonstrates that mid-gap conductance ratios are independent of the size of the HOMO-LUMO gap, even though the absolute values of the conductances are gap dependent.

The DFTpredicted energy level diagrams of the isolated cyclophanes (Figure 3B) show that the LUMO and LUMO+1 of the symmetric cyclophane 4-D 4+ are almost degenerate. By contrast, this degeneracy is lifted in the asymmetric cyclophanes, 1-D 4+ , 2-D 4+ 3-D 4+ , 5-D 4+ and 6-D 4+ , leading to a decrease in the LUMO energy by ~0.40 eV, compared with the LUMO of the 4-D 4+ . The LUMO/LUMO+1 energy difference in the asymmetric cyclophanes, indicated by their transport resonances (Figure 3A), shrinks to ~0.02 eV, because of the rearrangement of energy levels imposed by their interactions with Au electrodes. As the LUMOs shift towards the Au Fermi level, the corresponding conductance increases slightly from 10 -3.12 G0 for 4-D 4+ to ~10 -2.99 G0 and (Figure 3C) to 10 -4.12 and 10 -3.74 G0, respectively. This theoretically predicted trend agrees well with the experimentally measured results (Figure 2F). In an attempt to shed light on the opposite conductance trends obtained in N-substituted derivatives (1-D 4+ , 2-D 4+ and 3-D 4+ ) and double/triple bond-inserted (5-D 4+ and 6-D 4+ ) backbones, we analyzed the phase patterns of their MOs. The phase symmetries (Figure 3d) are determined from the LUMOs of the isolated channels. When the phenylene ring of 4-Me 4+ is substituted by two N atoms (3-Me 2+ ), the symmetry does not change, as indicated by the vertical black dashed line in Figure 3D. When the phenylene ring is replaced by a carbon-carbon double (-CH=CH-) (5-Me 2+ ) or triple (-C\u2261C-) bond (6-Me 2+ ), the symmetric LUMO becomes antisymmetric. These separated channels are then assembled to afford two-channel cyclophane circuits. In the case of",

In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of Nature. In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.",

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

The biases in my own thinking which I had to overcome to approach the right answer for the right reason are discussed. This is followed by a personal autobiography illustrating how I have led a life of serendipity with no real sense of purpose. Chance events have shaped my life. The algorithms for which I am best known are briefly discussed. Then highlights from the many applications of theory to excited states, bonding in ice, spin properties and magnetism, (e,2e) shake-up spectra, and organic reactions are mentioned. This wide range of applications is mostly due to accidental collaboration with colleagues who sought my help. My real interest was in developing methods which could address these problems.",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

Molecular orbitals are approximate solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electrons in the electric field of the molecule's atomic nuclei. However calculating the orbitals directly from this equation is far too intractable a problem. Instead they are obtained from the combination of atomic orbitals, which predict the location of an electron in an atom. A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s). Most commonly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method), especially in qualitative or very approximate usage. They are invaluable in providing a simple model of bonding in molecules, understood through molecular orbital theory.",

It was proposed early in the 20th century. In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) models to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.",

Combine SALCs of the same symmetry type from the two fragments, and from N SALCs form N molecular orbitals. 5. Estimate the relative energies of the molecular orbitals from considerations of overlap and relative energies of the parent orbitals, and draw the levels on a molecular orbital energy level diagram (showing the origin of the orbitals). 6.

Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.",

In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of Nature. In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.",

An electron density distribution of a molecule is a probability distribution that describes the average manner in which the electronic charge is distributed throughout real space in the attractive field exerted by the nuclei. According to QTAIM, molecular structure is revealed by the stationary points of the electron density together with the gradient paths of the electron density that originate and terminate at these points. QTAIM was primarily developed by Professor Richard Bader and his research group at McMaster University over the course of decades, beginning with analyses of theoretically calculated electron densities of simple molecules in the early 1960s and culminating with analyses",

Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

Its value is usually located between the fundamental gap (difference between ionization potential and electron affinity) and the optical gap. In addition, HOMO-LUMO gap can be related to a bulk material band gap or transport gap, which is usually much smaller than fundamental gap.

Molecular orbitals are approximate solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electrons in the electric field of the molecule's atomic nuclei. However calculating the orbitals directly from this equation is far too intractable a problem. Instead they are obtained from the combination of atomic orbitals, which predict the location of an electron in an atom. A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s). Most commonly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method), especially in qualitative or very approximate usage. They are invaluable in providing a simple model of bonding in molecules, understood through molecular orbital theory.",

In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion.

In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of Nature. In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.",

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well. With its description of the electron wave functions in molecules as delocalized molecular orbitals that possess the same symmetry",

Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system (bound state) composed of two or more atoms. Polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species, i.e., short-lived assemblies (resonances) of electrons and nuclei, such as radicals, molecular ions, Rydberg molecules, transition states, van der Waals complexes, or systems of colliding atoms as in Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.

In this year, the renowned Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell published his famous thirteen page article 'Molecules' in the September issue of Nature. In the opening section to this article, Maxwell clearly states: After speaking about the atomic theory of Democritus, Maxwell goes on to tell us that the word 'molecule' is a modern word. He states, \"it does not occur in Johnson's Dictionary. The ideas it embodies are those belonging to modern chemistry.\" We are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases. At this point, however, Maxwell notes that no one has ever seen or handled a molecule.",

The most obvious is when the nuclei are light, as with hydrogen.Yang et al. (2023) note: \"considering the high mobility of light hydrogen atoms, the non-adiabatic coupling of different electronic states beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is expected to be prominent\" (p. 2). Such coupling gives rise to conical intersections between energy surfaces that are used to understand reaction pathways(Baer 2006). Much of current work in quantum chemistry goes beyond BO by considering the interactions between electronic and nuclear vibrational motion which leads to the coupling of different energy states of molecules(Yarkony 2012). See alsoSibaev et al. (2020);Agostini and Curchod (2022) \nAs explained below, discreteness of the bound state spectrum requires transforming to a centre of mass frame.\nThis paper is not focused on the work of Sutcliffe and Woolley, which is a critique ofBorn and Huang (1954), and does not fully detail their position. We do claim that justifying Born's and Huang's approach requires an assumption of (quantum) localization, which their text inadequately distinguishes from clamping.\nOne idealization has already been made; as discussed in \u00a73, a total kinetic energy due to the velocity of the molecule as a whole should be subtracted.\nHere we make the important idealisation that the spectrum is discrete, which applies at many points in the following.\nThus contrast (3), with (2); the former expresses a function over R m \u00d7 R n , while the latter expresses a continuous infinity of equations for x 2 wavefunctions, one for each value of x 1 . The use, in \u03c8 a , of a comma in former versus a semi-colon in the latter indicates just this difference.\nThe following arguments are presented without careful attention to the distinction between x 1parameterized families of wavefunctions and operators on the one hand, and their direct integrals on the other. They are best read as equations relating the corresponding differential operators and functions in the position representation, which is indifferent to the distinction",

Thereafter progress was rapid as the newly emerging ideas of a 'quantum theory' were developed; by the time that quantum mechanics was finalized (1925/6) ideas about the separability of electronic and nuclear motions in molecules were common currency, and were carried forward into the new era.

It goes without saying that the nuclear-nuclear interaction is easily computed under the assumption that the nuclei are classical point charges and this is done in every quantum chemical calculation for anything that is larger than a single atom. Note that while adding the nuclear-nuclear interaction term is numerically essential, it is not so clear if adding the vibrational zero-point energy to potential energy surfaces is an advancement. Today, most potential energy surfaces are computed without vibrational zero-point energy.",

This mixture was treated with 3 equivalents of pTsOH until the 1 H NMR signals shifted toward higher frequency, confirming Z to E isomerization (entry 5, Scheme S4). When the solution had the E isomer as the major product, the effect of protonation by irradiation with 400 nm light for 10 minutes resulted in no further isomerization of the Z isomer (entry 6, Scheme S4). Next, in our study, we tested the compound using 445 nm light and determined the complete transformation to the E isomer (entry 7, Scheme S4). Subsequently, the solution was neutralized with 7 equivalents of triethylamine, and it was irradiated again with 400 nm light for 10 minutes, obtaining a high ratio of the Z isomer (entry 9, Scheme S4), thus completing the operation cycle.

Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

Using the valence bond approximation this can be understood by the type of bonds between the atoms that make up the molecule. When atoms interact to form a chemical bond, the atomic orbitals of each atom are said to combine in a process called orbital hybridisation. The two most common types of bonds are sigma bonds (usually formed by hybrid orbitals) and pi bonds (formed by unhybridized p orbitals for atoms of main group elements). The geometry can also be understood by molecular orbital theory where the electrons are delocalised.

In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

The presence of two seemingly different descriptions of molecules by the two theories led to struggles between the main proponents, Linus Pauling and Robert Mulliken, and their supporters. Until the 1950s, VB theory was dominant, and then it was eclipsed by MO theory. The struggles will be discussed, as well as the new dawn of VB theory, and its future.",

Combine SALCs of the same symmetry type from the two fragments, and from N SALCs form N molecular orbitals. 5. Estimate the relative energies of the molecular orbitals from considerations of overlap and relative energies of the parent orbitals, and draw the levels on a molecular orbital energy level diagram (showing the origin of the orbitals). 6.

Molecular orbitals are approximate solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the electrons in the electric field of the molecule's atomic nuclei. However calculating the orbitals directly from this equation is far too intractable a problem. Instead they are obtained from the combination of atomic orbitals, which predict the location of an electron in an atom. A molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule: the spatial distribution and energy of one (or one pair of) electron(s). Most commonly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals (the LCAO-MO method), especially in qualitative or very approximate usage.

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well. With its description of the electron wave functions in molecules as delocalized molecular orbitals that possess the same symmetry",

The term 1\u03c0 represents the two electrons in the two degenerate \u03c0*-orbitals (antibonding). From Hund's rules, these electrons have parallel spins in the ground state, and so dioxygen has a net magnetic moment (it is paramagnetic).

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.",

This mixture was treated with 3 equivalents of pTsOH until the 1 H NMR signals shifted toward higher frequency, confirming Z to E isomerization (entry 5, Scheme S4). When the solution had the E isomer as the major product, the effect of protonation by irradiation with 400 nm light for 10 minutes resulted in no further isomerization of the Z isomer (entry 6, Scheme S4). Next, in our study, we tested the compound using 445 nm light and determined the complete transformation to the E isomer (entry 7, Scheme S4). Subsequently, the solution was neutralized with 7 equivalents of triethylamine, and it was irradiated again with 400 nm light for 10 minutes, obtaining a high ratio of the Z isomer (entry 9, Scheme S4), thus completing the operation cycle.

The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk.

In the case of the conrotatory 4 electron electrocyclic ring closure of 1,3-butadiene, the lowest molecular orbital \u03a81 is asymmetric (A) with respect to the C2 axis. So this molecular orbital is correlated with the \u03c0 orbital of cyclobutene, the lowest energy orbital that is also (A) with respect to the C2 axis. Similarly, \u03a82, which is symmetric (S) with respect to the C2 axis, is correlated with \u03c3 of cyclobutene. The final two correlations are between the antisymmetric (A) molecular orbitals \u03a83 and \u03c3*, and the symmetric (S) molecular orbitals \u03a84 and \u03c0*.",

When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full \u03c3 (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty \u03c3* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.",

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

He himself acknowledged that this general concept was not novel, but explained that the new data available to him allowed the previous generalizations to be expanded upon and honed. He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

The simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule-ion, H2+, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one-electron bond. H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry.",

For both systems, the predictions from MO-ADK are also compared to results from SFA. Refer to Table IV, we note that the difference in binding energies between HOMO and HOMO-1 in CO is 2.9 eV, and 3.5 eV for HCl. First we examine the \u03b8-dependence predicted by MO-ADK in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 . Interestingly, its P (\u03b8) increases rapidly from 90 \u2022 to 180 \u2022 , making it almost like a symmetric molecule.",

He also noted that Mulliken had previously attempted to construct a correlation diagram for the possible orbitals of a polyatomic molecule in two different nuclear configurations, and had even tried to use this diagram to explain shapes and spectra of molecules in their ground and excited states. However, Mulliken was unable to explain the reasons for the rises and falls of certain curves with increases in angle, thus Walsh claimed \"his diagram was either empirical or based upon unpublished computations.\"",

H2+ is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron, which means that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron\u2013electron repulsion.

The HOMO of CO is a \u03c3 orbital, its P (\u03b8) drops rapidly from 0 \u2022 to 90 \u2022 and stays relative flat at larger angles. The HOMO-1 is a \u03c0 orbital and its P (\u03b8) peaks near 90 \u2022 . For HCl, the HOMO is a \u03c0 orbital and it peaks near 90 \u2022 . For the HOMO-1, it is a \u03c3 orbital and its P(\u03b8) drops steadily till near 90 \u2022 .

Mulliken\nUp to this point, the primary way to calculate the electronic structure of molecules was based on a calculation by Walter Heitler and Fritz London on the hydrogen molecule (H2) in 1927. With the conception of hybridized atomic orbitals by John C. Slater and Linus Pauling, which rationalized observed molecular geometries, the method was based on the premise that the bonds in any molecule could be described in a manner similar to the bond in H2, namely, as overlapping atomic orbitals centered on the atoms involved. Since it corresponded to chemists' ideas of localized bonds between pairs of atoms, this method (called the Valence-Bond (VB) or Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling (HLSP) method), was very popular. In attempting to calculate the properties of excited states (molecules that have been excited by an energy source), the VB method does not always work well.

This separation defines two major fields for quantum chemistry, electronic structure theory and the corresponding electronic Hamiltonian (in atomic units): \nH el = \u2212 n e i=1 1 2 r i + n e i=1\nwith the r i electronic and R n nuclear positions and electric charges, Z n ; and nuclear motion theory with the Hamiltonian for the motion of the atomic nuclei (or rovibrational Hamiltonian):\nH nuc =T(\u03c1) +V,( 2 )\nwhereT(\u03c1) is the rovibrational kinetic energy operator and the potential energy,V, which is called the potential energy surface and it is obtained from the eigenvalues of Equation (1) computed at different positions of the atomic nuclei. Within this framework, a variety of molecular properties are derived from the eigenstates of the electronic Hamiltonian, Equation (1), and an effective combination of the quantum mechanics of electrons with classical electronic properties of identifiable nuclei and quantum mechanics for nuclear motions, Equation (2).\n\nSeveral chemical concepts gain a theoretical background from this construct, most importantly the potential energy surface (PES) is defined. Its minimum structure (or structures if it has several local minima) defines the equilibrium structure, which is a purely mathematical construct resulting from the separability approximation but it is usually identified with the classical molecular structure. Then, the nuclei are re-quantised to solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the atomic nuclei, Equation (2), to calculate rovibrational states, resonances, reaction rates, etc.",

Thereafter progress was rapid as the newly emerging ideas of a 'quantum theory' were developed; by the time that quantum mechanics was finalized (1925/6) ideas about the separability of electronic and nuclear motions in molecules were common currency, and were carried forward into the new era.

Moreover, the DM is a unique characteristic [1,2] of the given system in contrast to NCMOs and/or LMOs. The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs. Consequently, elements of the relevant representation matrix of the DM (commonly referred to as the charge-bond order (CBO) matrix) are generally determined by sums over all occupied MOs of products of respective coefficients of the above-specified linear combinations (MO LCAO coefficients), i.e. by all electrons of the given system. This implies both the CBO matrix P and the resulting charge distribution to belong to collective properties of molecules (Section 3). That is why applicability of classical principles of locality, additivity and transferability both to separate elements of the CBO matrix and to the overall charge distribution is among natural expectations.",

Molecular Orbital Energy Diagrams - \nThe relative energy levels of atomic and molecular orbitals are typically shown in a molecular orbital diagram (Figure 5.34). For a diatomic molecule, the atomic orbitals of one atom are shown on the left, and those of the other atom are shown on the right. Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

Two atomic orbitals in phase create a larger electron density, which leads to the \u03c3 orbital. If the two 1s orbitals are not in phase, a node between them causes a jump in energy, the \u03c3* orbital. From the diagram you can deduce the bond order, how many bonds are formed between the two atoms. For this molecule it is equal to one. Bond order can also give insight to how close or stretched a bond has become if a molecule is ionized. Dihelium and diberyllium Dihelium (He-He) is a hypothetical molecule and MO theory helps to explain why dihelium does not exist in nature. The MO diagram for dihelium looks very similar to that of dihydrogen, but each helium has two electrons in its 1s atomic orbital rather than one for hydrogen, so there are now four electrons to place in the newly formed molecular orbitals.",

In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).

This function can be used to calculate chemical and physical properties such as the probability of finding an electron in any specific region. The terms atomic orbital and molecular orbital were introduced by Robert S. Mulliken in 1932 to mean one-electron orbital wave functions. At an elementary level, they are used to describe the region of space in which a function has a significant amplitude.",

When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full \u03c3 (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty \u03c3* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.",

Chemical substances will form bonding interactions if their orbitals become lower in energy when they interact with each other. Different bonding orbitals are distinguished that differ by electron configuration (electron cloud shape) and by energy levels. The molecular orbitals of a molecule can be illustrated in molecular orbital diagrams. Common bonding orbitals are sigma (\u03c3) orbitals which are symmetric about the bond axis, and or pi (\u03a0) orbitals with a nodal plane along the bond axis. Less common are delta (\u03b4) orbitals and phi (\u03c6) orbitals with two and three nodal planes respectively along the bond axis. Antibonding orbitals are signified by the addition of an asterisk. For example, an antibonding pi orbital may be shown as \u03c0*. Overview",

If that were the case, the 3d-orbital would have the same energy as the 3p-orbital, as it does in hydrogen, yet it clearly does not. There is no special reason why the Fe ion should have the same electron configuration as the chromium atom, given that iron has two more protons in its nucleus than chromium, and that the chemistry of the two species is very different. Melrose and Eric Scerri have analyzed the changes of orbital energy with orbital occupations in terms of the two-electron repulsion integrals of the Hartree-Fock method of atomic structure calculation. More recently Scerri has argued that contrary to what is stated in the vast majority of sources including the title of his previous article on the subject, 3d orbitals rather than 4s are in fact preferentially occupied.",

The most popular way of obtaining the DM of a certain molecule consists in constructing a projector to the relevant set of occupied one-electron orbitals [1,2,48], the latter usually coinciding with the canonical MOs (CMOs) [Although NCMOs (or LMOs) also are able to play this role as discussed in the next Section]. Molecular orbitals, in turn, usually are expressed as linear combinations of certain basis functions, e.g. of AOs.

Each horizontal line represents one orbital that can hold two electrons. The molecular orbitals formed by the combination of the atomic orbitals are shown in the center. Dashed lines show which of the atomic orbitals combine to form the molecular orbitals. For each pair of atomic orbitals that combine, one lower-energy (bonding) molecular orbital and one higher-energy (antibonding) orbital result. Thus we can see that combining the six $2 p$ atomic orbitals results in three bonding orbitals (one $\\sigma$ and two $\\pi$ ) and three antibonding orbitals (one $\\sigma^{*}$ and two $\\pi^{*}$ ).\n\nWe predict the distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals by filling the orbitals in the same way that we fill atomic orbitals, by the Aufbau principle. Lower-energy orbitals fill first, electrons spread out among degenerate orbitals before pairing, and each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins (Figure 5.34). Just as we write electron configurations for atoms, we can write the molecular electronic configuration by listing the orbitals with superscripts indicating the number of electrons present. For clarity, we place parentheses around molecular orbitals with the same energy. In this case, each orbital is at a different energy, so parentheses separate each orbital. Thus we would expect a diatomic molecule or ion containing seven electrons (such as $\\mathrm{Be}_{2}{ }^{+}$) would have the molecular electron configuration $\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{1 s}^{*}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}\\right)^{2}\\left(\\sigma_{2 s}^{*}\\right)^{1}$.

Heitler and London's method was extended by the American theoretical physicist John C. Slater and the American theoretical chemist Linus Pauling to become the valence-bond (VB) [or Heitler\u2013London\u2013Slater\u2013Pauling (HLSP)] method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists' drawings of bonds. It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of an atom combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed, incorporating the two key concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance.

It was proposed early in the 20th century. In molecular orbital theory, electrons in a molecule are not assigned to individual chemical bonds between atoms, but are treated as moving under the influence of the atomic nuclei in the whole molecule. Quantum mechanics describes the spatial and energetic properties of electrons as molecular orbitals that surround two or more atoms in a molecule and contain valence electrons between atoms. Molecular orbital theory revolutionized the study of chemical bonding by approximating the states of bonded electrons\u2014the molecular orbitals\u2014as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO). These approximations are made by applying the density functional theory (DFT) or Hartree\u2013Fock (HF) models to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.",

To use FMO theory, the reaction should be considered as two separate ideas: (1) whether or not the reaction is allowed, and (2) which mechanism the reaction proceeds through. In the case of a [1,5] shift on pentadiene, the HOMO of the sigma bond (i.e. a constructive bond) and the LUMO of butadiene on the remaining 4 carbons is observed. Assuming the reaction happens suprafacially, the shift results with the HOMO of butadiene on the 4 carbons that are not involved in the sigma bond of the product. Since the pi system changed from the LUMO to the HOMO, this reaction is allowed (though it would not be allowed if the pi system went from LUMO to LUMO).",

A molecular orbital describes the behavior of one electron in the electric field generated by the nuclei and some average distribution of the other electrons. In the case of two electrons occupying the same orbital, the Pauli principle demands that they have opposite spin. Necessarily this is an approximation, and highly accurate descriptions of the molecular electronic wave function do not have orbitals (see configuration interaction).",
