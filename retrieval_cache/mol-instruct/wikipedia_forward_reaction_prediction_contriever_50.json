Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture.

Although monoalkyne complexes CpCo(CO)(R1C2R2) have not been isolated, their analogues, CpCo(PPh3)(R1C2R2) are made by the following reactions: CpCo(CO)2 + PR3 → CO + CpCo(CO)(PR3) CpCoL(PR3) + R2C2 → L + CpCo(PR3)(R2C2) (where L = CO or PR3) CpCo(CO)2 catalyzes the formation of pyridines from a mixture of alkynes and nitriles. Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2]. Ketones are produced by carbonylation of these dialkyl complexes, regenerating CpCo(CO)2.",

The macrocyclic ligand does dissociate in the course of this dramatic change in formal oxidation state of the metal. The complex, [κ3-TACN)Cu(II)Cl2], a catalyst for hydrolytic cleavage of phosphodiester bonds in DNA, is prepared as follows from TACN trihydrochloride: TACN·3HCl + CuCl2·3H2O + 3 NaOH → [(κ3-TACN)CuCl2] + 6 H2O + 3 NaCl",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC.

For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

The limiting reactant is the one which can form the smallest amount of the product considered. This method can be extended to any number of reactants more easily than the first method. Example 20.0 g of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) are reacted with 8.00 g aluminium (Al) in the following thermite reaction: Fe2O3(s) + 2 Al(s) -> 2 Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) Since the reactant amounts are given in grams, they must be first converted into moles for comparison with the chemical equation, in order to determine how many moles of Fe can be produced from either reactant.",

For example, the common form of (2,4)-hexadiene is written C/C=C/C=C/C. As a more complex example, beta-carotene has a very long backbone of alternating single and double bonds, which may be written CC1CCC/C(C)=C1/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C(C)=C/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C=C(C)/C=C/C2=C(C)/CCCC2(C)C.

Cu(s) + Cl2(g) → CuCl2(l) It is also commercially practical to combine copper(II) oxide with an excess of ammonium chloride at similar temperatures, producing copper chloride, ammonia, and water: CuO + 2NH4Cl → CuCl2 + 2NH3 + H2O Although copper metal itself cannot be oxidised by hydrochloric acid, copper-containing bases such as the hydroxide, oxide, or copper(II) carbonate can react to form CuCl2 in an acid-base reaction. Once prepared, a solution of CuCl2 may be purified by crystallization. A standard method takes the solution mixed in hot dilute hydrochloric acid, and causes the crystals to form by cooling in a Calcium chloride (CaCl2)-ice bath.",

For example, F/C=C/F (see depiction) is one representation of trans-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorine atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond (as shown in the figure), whereas F/C=C\\F (see depiction) is one possible representation of cis-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorines are on the same side of the double bond.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture.

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction. There are many different termination combinations, some examples are: Union of methyl radicals from a C-C bond leading to ethane (a side product). CH3. + CH3. -> CH3-CH3",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article.

Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

Occurrence and applications Some thiosemicarbazones have medicinal properties, e.g. the antiviral metisazone and the antibiotic thioacetazone. Thiosemicarbazones are also widely used as ligands in coordination chemistry. The affinity of thiosemicarbazones for metal ions is exploited in controlling iron overload.

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction.

It is a white odorless solid, soluble in water and several organic solvents. From the chemistry perspective, acrylamide is a vinyl-substituted primary amide (CONH2). It is produced industrially mainly as a precursor to polyacrylamides, which find many uses as water-soluble thickeners and flocculation agents. It is highly toxic, likely to be carcinogenic, but its main derivative polyacrylamide is nontoxic. The possibility that this innocuous bulk chemical contains traces of its hazardous precursor has long attracted attention. Production Acrylamide can be prepared by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile: CH2=CHCN + H2O → CH2=CHC(O)NH2",

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

For example, treatment of benzenediazonium chloride with benzene (an aromatic compound) in the presence of sodium hydroxide gives diphenyl: [C6H5N2+]Cl- + C6H6 -> C6H5-C6H5 + N2 + HCl This reaction is known as the Gomberg–Bachmann reaction. A similar conversion is also achieved by treating benzenediazonium chloride with ethanol and copper powder.",

The constitution of organocopper compounds depends on their method of preparation and the various kinds of organocopper reagents exhibit different reactivity profiles. As a result, the scope of reactions involving organocopper reagents is extremely broad. Organocopper complexes (RCu) are produced when a copper(I) halide and organolithium are combined. In conjunction with Lewis acidic additives such as boron trifluoride etherate, these reagents are used for conjugate addition reactions.",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds.

The limiting reactant is the one which can form the smallest amount of the product considered. This method can be extended to any number of reactants more easily than the first method. Example 20.0 g of iron (III) oxide (Fe2O3) are reacted with 8.00 g aluminium (Al) in the following thermite reaction: Fe2O3(s) + 2 Al(s) -> 2 Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) Since the reactant amounts are given in grams, they must be first converted into moles for comparison with the chemical equation, in order to determine how many moles of Fe can be produced from either reactant.",

Looking from the nitrogen–carbon bond, the hydrogen (H), methyl (C), and carboxylate (C(=O)O) groups appear clockwise. D-Alanine can be written as N[C@H](C)C(=O)O (see depiction). While the order in which branches are specified in SMILES is normally unimportant, in this case it matters; swapping any two groups requires reversing the chirality indicator. If the branches are reversed so alanine is written as NC(C(=O)O)C, then the configuration also reverses; L-alanine is written as N[C@H](C(=O)O)C (see depiction). Other ways of writing it include C[C@H](N)C(=O)O, OC(=O)[C@@H](N)C and OC(=O)[C@H](C)N.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

Many related reactions have been demonstrated. For example, P4S10 converts anisole to Lawesson's reagent, [(CH3OC6H4)PS2]2. Also indicating an electron-rich ring, anisole readily forms π-complexes with metal carbonyls, e.g. Cr(η6-anisole)(CO)3. The ether linkage is highly stable, but the methyl group can be removed with hydroiodic acid: CH3OC6H5 + HI → HOC6H5 + CH3I Birch reduction of anisole gives 1-methoxycyclohexa-1,4-diene. Preparation Anisole is prepared by methylation of sodium phenoxide with dimethyl sulfate or methyl chloride: 2 C6H5O−Na+ + (CH3O)2SO2 → 2 C6H5OCH3 + Na2SO4",

For example, cyclohexane and dioxane may be written as C1CCCCC1 and O1CCOCC1 respectively. For a second ring, the label will be 2. For example, decalin (decahydronaphthalene) may be written as C1CCCC2C1CCCC2.",

Also, it is permitted to reuse ring numbers after the first ring has closed, although this usually makes formulae harder to read. For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Choosing ring-closing bonds appropriately can reduce the number of parentheses required. For example, toluene is normally written as Cc1ccccc1 or c1ccccc1C, avoiding the parentheses required if written as c1cc(C)ccc1 or c1cc(ccc1)C. Stereochemistry SMILES permits, but does not require, specification of stereoisomers. Configuration around double bonds is specified using the characters / and \\ to show directional single bonds adjacent to a double bond. For example, F/C=C/F (see depiction) is one representation of trans-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorine atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond (as shown in the figure), whereas F/C=C\\F (see depiction) is one possible representation of cis-1,2-difluoroethylene, in which the fluorines are on the same side of the double bond.",

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction.

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

It is a colourless solid that is used in the synthesis of other copper complexes. The cation [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ is a well-known example of a transition metal nitrile complex. Structure As confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies, copper(I) ion is coordinated to four almost linear acetonitrile ligands in a nearly ideal tetrahedral geometry. Related complexes are known with other anions including the perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, and nitrate. With the weakly coordinating anion B(C6F5)4−, salts of [Cu(CH3CN)2]+ are obtained. The acetonitrile ligands protect the Cu+ ion from oxidation to Cu2+. Acetonitrile is not bound very strongly to the copper ion, thus the complex is a useful source of Cu(I). With other counteranions, complexes of [Cu(MeCN)3]+ are observed.",

This is possible with CI, because formation of [M+1]+ eliminates a stable molecule, which can be used to guess the functional groups present. Besides that, CI facilitates the ability to detect the molecular ion peak, due to less extensive fragmentation. Chemical ionization can also be used to identify and quantify an analyte present in a sample, by coupling chromatographic separation techniques to CI such as gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE). This allows selective ionization of an analyte from a mixture of compounds, where accurate and precised results can be obtained.

Almost all neutral analytes can form positive ions through the reactions described above.",

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction. There are many different termination combinations, some examples are: Union of methyl radicals from a C-C bond leading to ethane (a side product). CH3. + CH3. -> CH3-CH3",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

These reactions generate chloride, which can be undesirable. Acyl chlorides hydrolyze, yielding the carboxylic acid:",

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction.

Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

Stereochemistry SMILES permits, but does not require, specification of stereoisomers. Configuration around double bonds is specified using the characters / and \\ to show directional single bonds adjacent to a double bond.

Stereochemistry SMILES permits, but does not require, specification of stereoisomers. Configuration around double bonds is specified using the characters / and \\ to show directional single bonds adjacent to a double bond.

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds.

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

During the propagation of the reaction, there are several highly reactive species that will be removed and stabilized at the termination step. Termination: This kind of reaction takes place when the radical species interact directly. The products of the termination reactions are typically very low yield in comparison to the main products or intermediates as the highly reactive radical species are in relatively low concentration in relation to the rest of the mixture. This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction. There are many different termination combinations, some examples are: Union of methyl radicals from a C-C bond leading to ethane (a side product). CH3. + CH3. -> CH3-CH3",

At physiological conditions, ketopantoic acid exists as its conjugate base, ketopantoate (HOCH2(CH3)2CC(O)CO2−). Biosynthetic context Its biosynthesis proceeds from ketoisovalerate by hydroxymethylation: (CH3)2CHC(O)CO2− + CH2O → HOCH2(CH3)2CC(O)CO2− This conversion is catalyzed by ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase, which gives ketopantoate. Ketopantoate is substrate for 2-dehydropantoate 2-reductase, which produces pantoate, a precursor to pantothenic acid, a common prosthetic group. References",

Copper at red heat (300-400°C) combines directly with chlorine gas, giving (molten) copper (II) chloride. The reaction is very exothermic. Cu(s) + Cl2(g) → CuCl2(l) It is also commercially practical to combine copper(II) oxide with an excess of ammonium chloride at similar temperatures, producing copper chloride, ammonia, and water: CuO + 2NH4Cl → CuCl2 + 2NH3 + H2O Although copper metal itself cannot be oxidised by hydrochloric acid, copper-containing bases such as the hydroxide, oxide, or copper(II) carbonate can react to form CuCl2 in an acid-base reaction. Once prepared, a solution of CuCl2 may be purified by crystallization. A standard method takes the solution mixed in hot dilute hydrochloric acid, and causes the crystals to form by cooling in a Calcium chloride (CaCl2)-ice bath.",

The two cyano groups are bonded together at their carbon atoms: N≡C‒C≡N, although other isomers have been detected.
