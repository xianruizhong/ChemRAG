The isolated fractions are dephosphorylated and subsequently desalted by a novel approach using solid barium hydroxide in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to the amount of ammonium sulfate present in the dephosphorylated sample. The myo-inositol derived from each inositol phosphate species was quantified by stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the hexakis(trimethylsilyl) derivative using hexadeutero-myo-inositol as the internal standard.

Despite extensive investigations, in particular concerning its potential role in mediating cellular Ca2+ influx, no exact cellular function has been described for this inositol phosphate; however, binding sites have been identified in a number of tissues and it has been shown to act synergistically with Ins(1,4,5)P3. To assist in the elucidation of the mechanism of action and structural requirements within the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 moiety that are necessary for recognition and activation of the receptor, structural analogues of this tetrakisphosphate are required. Routes for the synthesis of racemic 6-deoxy-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate [6-deoxy-DL-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4] and the chiral antipodes D- and L-6-deoxy-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate are described here. The racemic tetrakisphosphate was synthesised from DL-1,2-O-isopropylidene-myo-inositol in eight steps. Deoxygenation at C-6 was achieved following the Barton-McCombie procedure. Both chiral tetrakisphosphates were synthesised through resolution of racemic cis-diol 6-deoxy-1,4,5-tri-O-p-methoxybenzyl-myo-inositol with the chiral auxiliary (S)-(+)-O-acetylmandelic acid. Absolute configuration was confirmed by synthesis of the known D-6-deoxy-myo-inositol. Both D-6-deoxy-Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 and its enantiomer will be useful tools to unravel the enigmatic role of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 in the polyphosphoinositide pathway of signal transduction.",

Prostaglandins A2, B2, D3, E2, and F2 alpha were poor substrates for this enzyme, the rates of reaction being less than 10% of that with prostaglandin D2. The enzyme was separated by Sephadex column chromatography from the other NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase that was also present in brain and metabolized prostaglandins B2, E2, and F2 alpha much more effectively than D2. The primary reaction product was tentatively identified as 15-ketoprostaglandin D2 by its characteristic absorption spectrum with a peak at 415 nm at pH 9. This compound was further converted to 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin D2 in the presence of NADPH by the action of 15-ketoprostaglandin delta 13-reductase that was co-purified with the dehydrogenase. This dehydrogenase appears to be responsible for the specific inactivation of prostaglandin D2 which is the major prostaglandin in the central nervous system.",

ALD is characterized biochemically by the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) due to an impairment in the beta-oxidation of these fatty acids in peroxisome. From the observation that oxidation of VLCFA-CoA is normal in fibroblasts from patients with ALD, it was concluded that the gene coding for VLCFA-CoA synthetase was a candidate gene for ALD. Using positional cloning strategies, we have identified a gene which was found partially deleted in 7% of 85 independent patients with ALD. The predicted protein (ALDP) sequence shows significant homology to the 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein which is involved in peroxisome biogenesis and belongs to the 'ATP binding' superfamily of transporters.

The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs : &gt; C22:0, mainly C26:0), which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes. Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers.

The X-ALD gene, identified by positional cloning, encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein (adrenoleukodystrophy protein; ALDP) that belongs to the ATP binding cassette transporter protein superfamily. Mutational analyses and functional studies of the X-ALD gene confirm that it and not VLCS is the gene responsible for X-ALD. Its role in the beta-oxidation of VLCFAs and its effect on the function of VLCS are unclear. The complex pathology of X-ALD and the extreme variability of its clinical phenotypes are also unexplained. To facilitate understanding of X-ALD pathophysiology, we developed an X-ALD mouse model by gene targeting. The X-ALD mouse exhibits reduced beta-oxidation of VLCFAs, resulting in significantly elevated levels of saturated VLCFAs in total lipids from all tissues measured and in cholesterol esters from adrenal glands. Lipid cleft inclusions were observed in adrenocortical cells of X-ALD mice under the electron microscope. No neurological involvement has been detected in X-ALD mice up to 6 months.

The biochemical signature of X-ALD is increased levels of saturated very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; carbon chains of 22 or more) in tissues and plasma that has been associated with decreased peroxisomal very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLCS) activity and decreased peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation. It has been hypothesized that ABCD1, which has no demonstrable VLCS activity itself, has an indirect effect on peroxisomal VLCS activity and VLCFA beta-oxidation by transporting fatty acid substrates, VLCS protein or some required co-factor into peroxisomes. Here we report the characterization of a Vlcs knockout mouse that exhibits decreased peroxisomal VLCS activity and VLCFA beta-oxidation but does not accumulate VLCFA. The XALD/Vlcs double knockout mouse has the biochemical abnormalities observed in the individual knockout mice but does not display a more severe X-ALD phenotype. These data lead us to conclude that (1) VLCFA levels are independent of peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation, (2) there is no ABCD1/VLCS interaction and (3) the common severe forms of X-ALD cannot be modeled by decreasing peroxisomal VLCS activity in the XALD mouse.",

However, clinical manifestations are highly variable with regard to time of onset, site of initial pathology and rate of progression. In addition, the abnormal gene in X-ALD is not the gene for VLCS.

Surprisingly, ALDP overexpression by itself restores peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in SV40T-transformed control and X-ALD cells.

X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is associated with elevated levels of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; C(&gt;22:0)) that have been attributed to reduced peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation activity. Previously, our laboratory and others have reported elevated VLCFA levels and reduced peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in human and mouse X-ALD fibroblasts. In this study, we found normal levels of peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in tissues from ALD mice with elevated VLCFA levels. Treatment of ALD mice with pharmacological agents resulted in decreased VLCFA levels without a change in VLCFA beta-oxidation activity. These data indicate that ALDP does not determine the rate of VLCFA beta-oxidation and that VLCFA levels are not determined by the rate of VLCFA beta-oxidation. The rate of peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in human and mouse fibroblasts in vitro is affected by the rate of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. We hypothesize that ALDP facilitates the interaction between peroxisomes and mitochondria, resulting, when ALDP is deficient in X-ALD, in increased VLCFA accumulation despite normal peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation in ALD mouse tissues. In support of this hypothesis, mitochondrial structural abnormalities were observed in adrenal cortical cells of ALD mice.",

Due to the lack of effective drugs to treat these drug-resistant strains, the discovery or development of novel anti-TB drugs is important. Computer-aided drug design has become an established strategy for the identification of novel active chemicals through a combination of several drug design tools.

In recent years, the use of deep generative models (DGMs) is getting a lot of attention as an effective method of generating new molecules with desired properties. However, most of the properties do not have three-dimensional (3D) information, such as shape and pharmacophore. In drug discovery, pharmacophores are valuable clues in finding active compounds. In this study, we propose a computational strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for generating molecular structures with a desired pharmacophore. In addition, to extract selective molecules against a target protein, chemical genomics-based virtual screening (CGBVS) is used as post-processing method of deep reinforcement learning. As an example study, we have employed this strategy to generate molecular structures of selective TIE2 inhibitors. This strategy can be adopted into general use for generating selective molecules with a desired pharmacophore.",

Lupin tannins mainly occurred in cotyledons of the white lupin, predominantly in the bitter cultivar Bac. Free phenolic acids were mainly found in testas.

The reactivity of azetidines is driven by a considerable ring strain, while at the same the ring is significantly more stable than that of related aziridines, which translates into both facile handling and unique reactivity that can be triggered under appropriate reaction conditions. Recently, remarkable advances in the chemistry and reactivity of azetidines have been reported. In this review, we provide an overview of the synthesis, reactivity and application of azetidines that have been published in the last years with a focus on the most recent advances, trends and future directions. The review is organized by the methods of synthesis of azetidines and the reaction type used for functionalization of azetidines. Finally, recent examples of using azetidines as motifs in drug discovery, polymerization and chiral templates are discussed.",

In addition, we have expanded this concept to the synthesis of enantiomerically pure, terminal alkyl aziridines. Coupling of a TMS-protected aziridine alcohol, followed by acidic work-up to remove the silyl group, provides 1,2-amino alcohol products that are readily cyclized to aziridines. Both of these sequences display excellent functional group tolerance and deliver the desired azetidine and aziridine products in good to excellent yields. ",

However, despite recent advances in computational tools for molecular modeling and graphics, the task of constructing a model of the tertiary structure of a protein from experimental data remains complex and time-consuming, requiring extensive expert intervention. This paper describes an approach to protein model determination that incorporates crystallographic data, along with sequence data. A model is represented as an annotated graph that traces the backbone and side chains for a protein. The proposed approach incorporates numerical techniques that are applied to construct and analyze an electron density map for a unit cell of a crystal. The purpose of this work is to advance the ability to discern meaningful features of protein structure through the use of topological analysis of the relative density. Experimental results, which demonstrate the viability of the approach, are reported.",

These enzymes have several applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, the L-glutaminases that hydrolyze free L-glutamine (L-glutamine glutaminases, EC 3.5.1.2) have different structures and properties with respect to the L-glutaminases that hydrolyze the same amino acid covalently bound in peptides (peptidyl glutaminases, EC 3.5.1.43) and proteins (protein-glutamine glutaminase, EC 3.5.1.44). In the food industry, L-glutamine glutaminases are applied to enhance the flavor of foods, whereas protein glutaminases are useful to improve the functional properties of proteins. This review will focus on structural backgrounds and differences between these enzymes, the methodology available to measure the activity as well as strengths and limitations.

However, these rankings are difficult to interpret. It is essentially impossible to determine where novel active compounds might be found in database rankings. Thus, compound selection largely depends on intuition and guesswork. Herein, we show that molecular networks can substantially aid in the analysis of similarity-based compound rankings. A series of networks generated for rankings provides visual access to search results and adds chemical neighborhood and context information for reference compounds that are not available in rankings. Network structure is shown to serve as a diagnostic criterion for the likelihood to successfully select active compounds from rankings. In addition, comparison of different networks makes it possible to prioritize alternative similarity measures for search calculations and optimize the enrichment of active compounds in rankings.",

Newly synthesized peptidoglycan is partially cross-linked by a transpeptidation reaction with concomitant release of C-terminal D-alanine. Penicillin not only strongly inhibits release of D-alanine (98% at 1 mug/ml), but also markedly inhibits incorporation of acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide into the preformed cell-wall peptidoglycan. The simplest explanation for the results is that incorporation of newly synthesized strands of peptidoglycan and their attachment to \"older\" cell-wall peptidoglycan proceeds mainly by transpeptidation and that transglycosylation is responsible only for part of the elongation of the pre-existing peptidoglycan. Another possibility is that incorporation occurs by transglycosylation, but it cannot continue without concurrent formation of peptide cross-bridges.",

Recently, remarkable advances in the chemistry and reactivity of azetidines have been reported. In this review, we provide an overview of the synthesis, reactivity and application of azetidines that have been published in the last years with a focus on the most recent advances, trends and future directions. The review is organized by the methods of synthesis of azetidines and the reaction type used for functionalization of azetidines.

To identify the intermediate molecule, we used barley etioplasts instead of cucumber. Chlorophyll a and an additional pigment were found after incubation of chlorophyllide b with isolated barley etioplasts. The pigment has the same retention time and absorption spectrum as 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll, which has the hydroxymethyl group on ring B instead of the formyl group of chlorophyll b. Authentic 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll was prepared by reduction of chlorophyll b by NaBH4. Chlorophyll a accumulated during the incubation of 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyllide with etioplasts. These findings indicate that chlorophyll b is converted to chlorophyll a via 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll. Chlorophyll b and 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll accumulated within a short period of incubation of chlorophyllide b with etioplasts. However, chlorophyll a accumulated with a concomitant decrease of chlorophyll b and 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll.

The reaction studied showed an optimal pH of 7.5 and required both the soluble and membrane fractions of etioplasts together with ATP.

It is shown that the electron distribution in the protein-bound 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine differs from that of free 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine in buffer. The 13C and 15N chemical shifts indicate that the protein-bound 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine is embedded in a polar environment and that the ring system is strongly polarized. It is concluded that the two carbonyl groups play an important role in the polarization of the molecule. The N(3)-H group is not accessible to bulk solvent. The N(8) atom is sp2 hybridized and has delta+ character. Nuclear Overhauser effect studies indicate that the 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine ring is rigidly bound with no internal mobility. The NMR results indicate that the interaction between the ring system and the two apoproteins is almost the same.",

We have determined the structure of riboflavin synthase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe in complex with the substrate analog, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine at 2.1 A resolution. In contrast to the homotrimeric solution state of native riboflavin synthase, we found the enzyme to be monomeric in the crystal structure. Structural comparison of the riboflavin synthases of S. pombe and Escherichia coli suggests oligomer contact sites and delineates the catalytic site for dimerization of the substrate and subsequent fragmentation of the pentacyclic intermediate. The pentacyclic substrate dimer was modeled into the proposed active site, and its stereochemical features were determined. The model suggests that the substrate molecule at the C-terminal domain donates a four-carbon unit to the substrate molecule bound at the N-terminal domain of an adjacent subunit in the oligomer.",

A homologous series of three pyrazolopyrimidine analogues of a hypothetical intermediate in the lumazine synthase-catalyzed reaction were synthesized and evaluated as lumazine synthase inhibitors. The key steps of the synthesis were C-5 deprotonation of 4-chloro-2,6-dimethoxypyrimidine, acylation of the resulting anion, and conversion of the product to a pyrazolopyrimidine with hydrazine. Alkylation of the pyrazolopyrimidine with a substituted ribityl iodide and deprotection of the ribityl chain afforded the final set of three products. All three compounds were extremely potent inhibitors of the lumazine synthases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Magnaporthe grisea, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe lumazine synthase, with inhibition constants in the low nanomolar to subnanomolar range.

The proposed designing process mimics the classical manual design method, in which the drug designer sits in front of the computer screen and with the aid of computer graphics attempts to design the new drug. Therefore, the key principle of the algorithm is the parameterization of some criteria that affect the decision-making process carried out by the drug designer. This parameterization is based on the generation of weighting factors that reflect the knowledge and knowledge-based intuition of the drug designer, and thus add further rationalization to the drug design process. The proposed algorithm has been shown to yield a large variety of different structures, of which the drug designer may choose the most sensible. Performance tests indicate that with the proper set of parameters, the method generates a new structure within a short time.",

It was found that a number of naturally occurring compounds including distinct chalcones exert their effect by inhibition of tubulin polymerization. After the identification of tubulin polymerization as potential target for chalcone-type compounds, extensive researches have been made to design and synthesis of new anti-tubulin chalconoids. Although diverse chalcones have found to be potent anticancer agents but in the present review, we focused on the recently reported tubulin polymerization inhibitors from chalcone origin and related synthetic compounds, and their detailed synthetic methods and biological activities.

We hope that this overview may stimulate deeper investigations into the biochemical mechanisms by which chalcones exert their antineoplastic action. As a result, in the foreseeable future, chalcones may prove suitable lead molecules or early drug candidates for the prevention or treatment of various neoplastic diseases.",

Here we describe the identification and characterization of grisemycin, a linaridin produced by a previously unidentified gene cluster in Streptomyces griseus IFO 13350. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that grisemycin possesses at least three of the modifications found in cypemycin, as well as an analogous leader peptidase cleavage site. Expression of putative grisemycin biosynthetic genes in a Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) derivative, combined with deletion of the gene encoding the grisemycin precursor peptide, confirmed the identity of the grisemycin gene cluster. Both grisemycin and cypemycin depend on the transcriptional activator AdpA for wild-type levels of production.",

MolHyb tries to generate novel ligands through hybridizing the seed compound with helper compounds that bind to the same protein target or similar proteins. To facilitate the job of getting helper compounds, we compiled a modeled protein-ligand structure database as an extension to crystal structures in the PDB database by placing the bioactive compounds in ChEMBL into their corresponding 3D protein binding pocket properly. MolHyb works by searching for helper compounds from the protein-ligand structure database and migrating chemical moieties from helper compounds to the seed compound efficiently. Hybridization is performed at both cyclic and acyclic bonds. The users can also input their own helper compounds to MolHyb. We hope that MolHyb will be a useful tool for rational drug design.

Inhibitors of its action have potential use in the elucidation of the in vivo roles of these enzymes and in the treatment of pathologies associated therewith. Derivatives of adenosine 5'-pyrophosphate are the most potent nucleotide-based inhibitors known. Here, we use X-ray crystallography to visualize the binding of four naturally-occurring derivatives that contain 5'-pyrophosphate-linked extensions. 5'-ATP binds with the adenine occupying the B(2) subsite in the manner of an RNA substrate but with the gamma-phosphate at the P(1) subsite. Diadenosine triphosphate (Ap(3)A) binds with the adenine in syn conformation, the beta-phosphate as the principal P(1) subsite ligand and without order beyond the gamma-phosphate. NADPH and NADP(+) bind with the adenine stacked against an alternative rotamer of His119, the 2'-phosphate at the P(1) subsite, and without order beyond the 5'-alpha-phosphate. We also present the structure of the complex formed with pyrophosphate ion. The structural data enable existing kinetic data on the binding of these compounds to a variety of ribonucleases to be rationalized and suggest that as the complexity of the 5'-linked extension increases, the need to avoid unfavorable contacts places limitations on the number of possible binding modes.",

Importantly, PPATs are the potential target for developing antibiotics because bacterial and mammalian PPATs share little sequence homology. Previous structural studies revealed the mechanism of the recognizing substrates and products. The binding modes of ATP, ADP, Ppant, and dPCoA are highly similar in all known structures, whereas the binding modes of CoA or 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate binding are novel. To provide further structural information on ligand binding by PPATs, the crystal structure of PPAT from Enterococcus faecalis was solved in three forms: (i) apo form, (ii) binary complex with ATP, and (iii) binary complex with pantetheine. The substrate analog, pantetheine, binds to the active site in a similar manner to Ppant. The new structural information reported in this study including pantetheine as a potent inhibitor of PPAT will supplement the existing structural data and should be useful for structure-based antibacterial discovery against PPATs.",

Prokaryotic enzymes involved in the synthesis of CoA are quite different from their mammalian counterparts; hence, they are good targets for the development of antimicrobials to treat many diseases. There are antimicrobials that act by inhibiting CoA biosynthesis. It has been suggested that pantothenol exhibits antibacterial activity by competitively inhibiting pantothenate kinase, a key regulatory enzyme for CoA synthesis. Contrary to these suggestions, in this paper, we demonstrate that pantothenol acts as a substrate for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli pantothenate kinases. The product, 4'-phosphopantothenol, thus formed inhibits competitively the utilization of 4'-phosphopantothenate by CoaBC. Thus, it is the failure of CoaBC to utilize 4'-phosphopantothenol as a substrate that accounts for the bactericidal activity of pantothenol.",
