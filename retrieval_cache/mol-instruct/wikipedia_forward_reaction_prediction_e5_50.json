Sodium trifluoroacetate is likewise an weaker base. However, it can easily be protonated in the presence of suitably strong acids: CCl3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CCl3CO2H + HSO4- Trichloromethyl-anion precursor This reagent is useful for introducing the trichloromethyl group into other molecules.

There are two possible carbonyl products: one formed by migration of R1 (4) and the other by migration of R2 (5).

The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

This may be seen in the reaction of 1-chloro-2-butene with sodium hydroxide to give a mixture of 2-buten-1-ol and 1-buten-3-ol: CH3CH=CH-CH2-Cl → CH3CH=CH-CH2-OH + CH3CH(OH)-CH=CH2",

First, kinetic studies of reactions between diazomethane and various ketones have shown that the overall reaction follows second order kinetics. Additionally, the reactivity of two series of ketones are in the orders Cl3CCOCH3 > CH3COCH3 > C6H5COCH3 and cyclohexanone > cyclopentanone > cycloheptanone > cyclooctanone.

For example, in a normal-demand scenario, a diene bearing an electron-donating group (EDG) at C1 has its largest HOMO coefficient at C4, while the dienophile with an electron withdrawing group (EWG) at C1 has the largest LUMO coefficient at C2. Pairing these two coefficients gives the \"ortho\" product as seen in case 1 in the figure below.

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

Sodium trifluoroacetate is likewise an weaker base. However, it can easily be protonated in the presence of suitably strong acids: CCl3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CCl3CO2H + HSO4- Trichloromethyl-anion precursor This reagent is useful for introducing the trichloromethyl group into other molecules.

A copper(III)-aryl-alkoxide or copper(III)-aryl-amide intermediate undergoes Reductive elimination to give the aryl ether or aryl amine, respectively: Ar-Cu(III)-NHR-L2 → Ar-NHR + Cu(I)L2 Ar-Cu(III)-OR-L2 → Ar-OR + Cu(I)L2 Example An example of the Chan–Lam coupling to synthesize biologically active compounds is shown below: Compound 1, a pyrrole, is coupled with aryl boronic ester, 2, to afford product 3, which is then carried forward to the target 4. The nitrile group of 2 does not poison the catalyst. Pyridine is the ligand used for the reaction. Although the reaction requires three days, it was carried out at room temperature in ambient air and resulted in a 93% yield.

One such azide reactions is the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with alkyne, but the reaction requires high temperature and often gives mixtures of regioisomers. An improved reaction developed by chemist Karl Barry Sharpless involves the copper (I) catalyst, which couples azide with terminal alkyne that only give 1,4 substituted 1,2,3 triazoles in high yields (shown below in Figure 11). The mechanistic study suggests a stepwise reaction. The Cu (I) first couples with acetylenes, and then it reacts with azide to generate a six-membered intermediate. The process is very robust that it occurs at pH ranging from 4 to 12, and copper (II) sulfate is often used as a catalyst in the presence of a reducing agent.",

Active CCS or SOD molecules contribute to intracellular homeostatic control of essential metal ions (e.g., Cu1+/2+, Zn2+, Fe2+/3+, Mn2+, Ni3+) in organisms, and thus, these biomolecules can balance pro-oxidative and antioxidative processes in the cytoplasm. Otherwise, free (loosely bound) transition metal ions take part in Fenton-like reactions in which deleterious hydroxyl radical is formed, which unrestrained would be destructive to proteins. The loss of (active) CCS increases the amyloid-β production in neurons which, in turn, is a major pathological hallmark of AD.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

Thus, the rate equation is often shown as having first-order dependence on electrophile and zero-order dependence on nucleophile. This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 reaction is often known as the dissociative substitution. This",

Types RNS are produced in animals starting with the reaction of nitric oxide (•NO) with superoxide (O2•−) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−): •NO (nitric oxide) + O2•− (superoxide) → ONOO− (peroxynitrite)",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

Those macrocyclic carbon suboxide polymer compounds are thought to be endogenous digoxin-like regulators of Na+/K+-ATP-ases and Ca-dependent ATP-ases, and endogenous natriuretics and antihypertensives. Other than that, some authors think also that those macrocyclic compounds of carbon suboxide can possibly diminish free radical formation and oxidative stress and play a role in endogenous anticancer",

Carbon monoxide is abundantly available and conveniently reactive, so it is widely used as a reactant in industrial chemistry. The term carbonylation also refers to oxidation of protein side chains. Organic chemistry Several industrially useful organic chemicals are prepared by carbonylations, which can be highly selective reactions. Carbonylations produce organic carbonyls, i.e., compounds that contain the C=O functional group such as aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and esters. Carbonylations are the basis of many types of reactions, including hydroformylation and Reppe Chemistry. These reactions require metal catalysts, which bind and activate the CO. These processes involve transition metal acyl complexes as intermediates. Much of this theme was developed by Walter Reppe. Hydroformylation",

Both oxygen centres bind to the metal to form a six-membered chelate ring. In some cases the chelate effect is so strong that no added base is needed to form the complex. Some complexes are prepared by metathesis using Tl(acac). Structure and bonding In the majority of its complexes acac forms six-membered C3O2M chelate rings. The Macacc ring in planar with a symmetry plane bisecting the ring. The acacM ring has aromatic character, consistent with delocalized bonding in the C3O2 portion.

Based on this information, the reactions would appear to proceed via nucleophilic attack of hydroxide at cobalt. Studies show, however, that the hydroxide deprotonates one NH3 ligand to give the conjugate base of the starting complex, i.e., [Co(NH3)4(NH2)Cl]+.

This increases the δ+ on the α-carbon, thus 1,2-addition of sodium amide is favored over 1,4-addition. The proximity of the amino group to the α-carbon once the coordination complex is formed also makes the 1,2-addition more likely to occur.

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

However, it can easily be protonated in the presence of suitably strong acids: CCl3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CCl3CO2H + HSO4- Trichloromethyl-anion precursor This reagent is useful for introducing the trichloromethyl group into other molecules. Decarboxylation produces the trichloromethyl anion, which is a sufficiently strong nucleophile to attack various carbonyl functional groups, such as aldehydes, carboxylic acid anhydrides, ketones (making a precursor for the Jocic–Reeve reaction), and acyl halides.",

During a chemical reaction reactants are transformed into products after passing through a high energy transition state. This process results in the consumption of the reactants. It can be a spontaneous reaction or mediated by catalysts which lower the energy of the transition state, and by solvents which provide the chemical environment necessary for the reaction to take place. When represented in chemical equations products are by convention drawn on the right-hand side, even in the case of reversible reactions. The properties of products such as their energies help determine several characteristics of a chemical reaction such as whether the reaction is exergonic or endergonic. Additionally the properties of a product can make it easier to extract and purify following a chemical reaction, especially if the product has a different state of matter than the reactants.

Studies show, however, that in the hydroxide deprotonates one NH3 ligand to give the conjugate base of the starting complex, i.e., [Co(NH3)4(NH2)Cl]+. In this monocation, the chloride spontaneously dissociates from this conjugate base of the starting complex. This pathway is called the Sn1CB mechanism.

The classical example is allylic rearrangement. When 1 mole of HCl adds to 1 mole of 1,3-butadiene, in addition to the ordinarily expected product 3-chloro-1-butene, we also find 1-chloro-2-butene. Isotope labelling experiments have shown that what happens here is that the additional double bond shifts from 1,2 position to 2,3 position in some of the product. This and other evidence (such as NMR in superacid solutions) shows that the intermediate carbocation must have a highly delocalized structure, different from its mostly classical (delocalization exists but is small) parent molecule.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

This specific configuration makes the CAACs very good σ-donors (higher HOMO) and π-acceptors (lower LUMO) when compared to NHCs. Moreover the reduced heteroatom stabilization of the carbene center in CAACs versus NHCs also gives rise to a smaller ΔEST (48.3 vs 72.7 kcal mol-1).",

This pyrocarbonate reacts with amines to give N-tert-butoxycarbonyl or so-called Boc derivatives. These carbamate derivatives do not behave as amines, which allows certain subsequent transformations to occur that would be incompatible with the amine functional group. The Boc group can later be removed from the amine using moderately strong acids (e.g., trifluoroacetic acid). Thus, Boc serves as a protective group, for instance in solid phase peptide synthesis.

Elimination of HCl (the major side product) creates a reactive nucleophilic intermediate NH3 + PCl4+ → \"HN=PCl3\" + HCl which through further attack of PCl4+ and subsequent HCl elimination, creates a growing acyclic intermediate HN=PCl3 + PCl4+ → [Cl3P–N=PCl3]+ + HCl NH3 + [Cl3P–N=PCl3]+ → [HN=P(Cl2)–N=PCl3]+ + HCl etc. until an eventual intramolecular attack leads to the formation of one of the cyclic oligomers.

In this monovalent cation, the chloride spontaneously dissociates. This pathway is called the SN1cB mechanism.",

The gene for CCL21 is located on human chromosome 9. CCL21 elicits its effects by binding to a cell surface chemokine receptor known as CCR7. In human lymph nodes, the fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) express CCL21 as a chemoattractant to guide naive, CCR7 expressing T cells to the T cell zone.

Unlike Negishi's reagent, Rosenthal's reagent is stable at room temperature and can be stored indefinitely under an inert atmosphere. A much more precise control over the stoichiometry of reactions is possible, especially because the instable (1-butene)zirconocene cannot be formed quantitatively. Stoichiometric and catalytic reactions can be performed and influenced by the use of different ligands, metals and substrate substituents.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

For example, the thiocyanate ion (SCN−) may attack from either the sulfur or the nitrogen. For this reason, the SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN− often leads to a mixture of an alkyl thiocyanate (R-SCN) and an alkyl isothiocyanate (R-NCS). Similar considerations apply in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. Halogens While the halogens aren't nucleophilic in their diatomic form (e.g. I2 is not a nucleophile), their anions are good nucleophiles. In polar, protic solvents, F− is the weakest nucleophile, and I− the strongest; this order is reversed in polar, aprotic solvents. Carbon Carbon nucleophiles are often organometallic reagents such as those found in the Grignard reaction, Blaise reaction, Reformatsky reaction, and Barbier reaction or reactions involving organolithium reagents and acetylides.

Both of these mechanisms predict inversion at the electrophilic carbon, which is observed in a number of cases. On the other hand, experiments with radical traps and the observation of racemization during substitution suggest a radical mechanism. (1)",

Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200–400 °C with a 54% yield.",

It is a linear molecule that, because of its simplicity, is of interest in a variety of areas. It is, however, so extremely reactive that it is not encountered in everyday life. It is classified as a cumulene and an oxocarbon. Occurrence Dicarbon monoxide is a product of the photolysis of carbon suboxide: C3O2 → CO + C2O It is stable enough to observe reactions with NO and NO2. Called ketenylidene in organometallic chemistry, it is a ligand observed in metal carbonyl clusters, e.g. [OC2Co3(CO)9]+. Ketenylidenes are proposed as intermediates in the chain growth mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch Process, which converts carbon monoxide and hydrogen to hydrocarbon fuels. The organophosphorus compound (C6H5)3PCCO (CAS# 15596-07-3) contains the C2O functionality. Sometimes called Bestmann's Ylide, it is a yellow solid. References Carbenes Oxocarbons",

For this reason, the SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN− often leads to a mixture of an alkyl thiocyanate (R-SCN) and an alkyl isothiocyanate (R-NCS). Similar considerations apply in the Kolbe nitrile synthesis. Halogens While the halogens aren't nucleophilic in their diatomic form (e.g. I2 is not a nucleophile), their anions are good nucleophiles. In polar, protic solvents, F− is the weakest nucleophile, and I− the strongest; this order is reversed in polar, aprotic solvents.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

Grignard reagents are basic and react with alcohols, phenols, etc. to give alkoxides (ROMgBr). The phenoxide derivative is susceptible to formylation by paraformaldehyde to give salicylaldehyde. Alkylation of metals and metalloids Like organolithium compounds, Grignard reagents are useful for forming carbon–heteroatom bonds. Grignard reagents react with many metal-based electrophiles. For example, they undergo transmetallation with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) to give dialkylcadmium: 2 RMgX + CdCl2 → R2Cd + 2 Mg(X)Cl",

For instance, glucose would be oxidized to gluconate by oxygen. However, the experiment also works with compounds such as vitamin C and benzoin, which do not contain an aldehyde group. Thus, the reaction is actually the oxidation of an acyloin or related α-hydroxycarbonyl group, which is a structural feature of glucose, to a 1,2-diketone. The reduced redox dye (colorless state) is formed from oxidized redox dye (blue). The color-change that occurs in the blue bottle experiment has features of a clock reaction, in which a visible change in the concentration of one or more reagents suddenly occurs upon the exhaustion of a limiting reagent. For example, the limiting reactant, oxygen, is consumed by another reactant, benzoin, with the help of safranin as a catalyst. Once the limited amount of oxygen has been used up, the catalyst is unable to change",

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

It has been hypothesized that NCA’s may be involved in how the very first polypeptides came to be. Evidence has strongly suggested that NCA’s were used as an intermediary step as amino acids formed polypeptide structures. This phenomenon has been observed by multiple different research groups utilizing multiple different methods. One of the most recent and strongest pieces of evidence supporting this is the observation that carbamoyl amino acids (CAAs) will easily react with NO/O2 gas mixtures and form an NCA intermediary. CAAs have been shown to result from the reaction of regular amino acids with cyanate ions which is a prebiotic situation that is known to have occurred. Thus, reacting CAAs with NO/O2 gas, which is known to have been present, to then form NCA’s is a valid scenario. However, these methods only describe how short polypeptides can be developed.

It is a linear molecule, as are the related cyanogen halides (NCF, NCBr, NCI). Cyanogen chloride is produced by the oxidation of sodium cyanide with chlorine. This reaction proceeds via the intermediate cyanogen ((CN)2). NaCN + Cl2 → ClCN + NaCl The compound trimerizes in the presence of acid to the heterocycle called cyanuric chloride. Cyanogen chloride is slowly hydrolyzed by water to release cyanate and chloride ions ClCN + H2O → NCO− + Cl− + 2H+ at neutral pH",

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously.

A 1,6-addition is also possible, for example in one step of the commercial-scale production of fulvestrant: Enantioselective Variants Diastereoselective conjugate addition reactions of chiral organocuprates provide β-functionalized ketones in high yield and diastereoselectivity. A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200–400 °C with a 54% yield.",

A significant advantage of this reaction is that it uses relatively inexpensive carboxylic acids (or their salts) and is far less air and moisture sensitive in comparison to typical cross-coupling organometallic reagents. Furthermore, the carboxylic acid moiety is a common feature of natural products and can also be prepared by relatively benign air oxidations. Additional benefits include the broad tolerance of functional groups, as well as the capacity to avoid the use of strong bases.

Diphosgene is related to phosgene and has comparable toxicity, but is more conveniently handled because it is a liquid, whereas phosgene is a gas. Production and uses Diphosgene is prepared by radical chlorination of methyl chloroformate under UV light: Cl-CO-OCH3 + 3 Cl2 —(hv)→ Cl-CO-OCCl3 + 3 HCl Another method is the radical chlorination of methyl formate: H-CO-OCH3 + 4 Cl2 —(hv)→ Cl-CO-OCCl3 + 4 HCl Diphosgene converts to phosgene upon heating or upon catalysis with charcoal. It is thus useful for reactions traditionally relying on phosgene. For example, it convert amines into isocyanates, secondary amines into carbamoyl chlorides, carboxylic acids into acid chlorides, and formamides into isocyanides. Diphosgene serves as a source of two equivalents of phosgene: 2 RNH2 + ClCO2CCl3 → 2 RNCO + 4 HCl",

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200–400 °C with a 54% yield.",

Thermal cracking of 3 typically requires T >160 °C. Reaction of 3 and 1 at 95 °C for 30 min in buffer gave quantitative formation of 2. As no free HCp-COOH was observed, in situ retro Diels-Alder and subsequent entry into path A was excluded.

Preparation, structure, handling CSI is prepared by treating cyanogen chloride with sulfur trioxide, the product being distilled directly from the reaction mixture. SO3 + ClCN → ClSO2NCO In this transformation, both the carbon and the nitrogen termini of CN are functionalized. The structure of CSI is represented as ClS(O)2-N=C=O. It consists of two electron-withdrawing components, the chlorosulfonyl group (SO2Cl) and the isocyanate group (-N=C=O). Because of its resulting electrophilicity, the use of CSI in chemical synthesis requires relatively inert solvents such as chlorocarbons, acetonitrile, and ethers.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

This relationship holds for situations where the amount of nucleophile is much greater than that of the intermediate. Instead, the rate equation may be more accurately described using steady-state kinetics. The reaction involves a carbocation intermediate and is commonly seen in reactions of secondary or tertiary alkyl halides under strongly basic conditions or, under strongly acidic conditions, with secondary or tertiary alcohols. With primary and secondary alkyl halides, the alternative SN2 reaction occurs. In inorganic chemistry, the SN1 reaction is often known as the dissociative substitution. This",

Sodium trifluoroacetate is likewise an weaker base. However, it can easily be protonated in the presence of suitably strong acids: CCl3CO2- + H2SO4 -> CCl3CO2H + HSO4- Trichloromethyl-anion precursor This reagent is useful for introducing the trichloromethyl group into other molecules.

Preparation Sodium cyclopentadienide is commercially available as a solution in THF. It is prepared by treating cyclopentadiene with sodium: 2 Na + 2 C5H6 → 2 NaC5H5 + H2 Commonly, the conversion is conducted by heating a suspension of molten sodium in dicyclopentadiene. In former times, the sodium was commonly provided in the form of \"sodium wire\" or \"sodium sand\", a fine dispersion of sodium prepared by melting sodium in refluxing xylene and rapidly stirring.

Examples include acetyl cyanide, formyl cyanide, and oxalyl dicyanide. Acyl cyanides are reagents in organic synthesis. Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like.

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration.

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond.

The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration.

It is a colourless liquid, although commercial samples often are brownish. It is used commercially as a precursor to the fungicide etridiazole. It is prepared by dehydration of trichloroacetamide. As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Trichloroacetonitrile can be obtained by chlorination of acetonitrile on a zinc, copper and alkaline earth metal halide-impregnated activated carbon catalyst at 200–400 °C with a 54% yield.",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

The SNi mechanism is observed in reactions of thionyl chloride with alcohols, and it is similar to SN1 except that the nucleophile is delivered from the same side as the leaving group. Nucleophilic substitutions can be accompanied by an allylic rearrangement as seen in reactions such as the Ferrier rearrangement.

In these reactions, it is the carbon adjacent to the metal that",

It is a colourless gas that melts at −155.6 °C and boils at −100.1 °C. It may be produced by the direction of its elements at 225 °C, though it must then be separated and purified from chlorine trifluoride and its reactants. Its properties are mostly intermediate between those of chlorine and fluorine. It will react with many metals and nonmetals from room temperature and above, fluorinating them and liberating chlorine. It will also act as a chlorofluorinating agent, adding chlorine and fluorine across a multiple bond or by oxidation: for example, it will attack carbon monoxide to form carbonyl chlorofluoride, COFCl. It will react analogously with hexafluoroacetone, (CF3)2CO, with a potassium fluoride catalyst to produce heptafluoroisopropyl hypochlorite, (CF3)2CFOCl; with nitriles RCN to produce RCF2NCl2; and with the sulfur oxides SO2 and SO3 to produce ClSO2F and",

In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration.

This reaction operates via a free radical mechanism. This reagent is also able to trifluoromethylate electron-deficient aromatic compounds under biphasic conditions. Zinc difluoromethanesulfinate, a related polymeric coordination complex, is able to introduce difluoromethyl groups (CHF2-) onto aromatic compounds under similar biphasic conditions as well. With the use of DMSO as an oxidant, it provides an environmentally friendly way for the synthesis of β-trifluoromethyl alcohols from alkenes.

As a bifunctional compound, trichloroacetonitrile can react at both the trichloromethyl and the nitrile group. The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

Production By condensing propadienedithione SCCCS or thioxopropadienone OCCCS in solid argon and irradiating with ultraviolet radiation, CCS is formed. Another way is via a glow discharge in a mixture of carbon disulfide and helium. Yet another way is through electron irradiation of sulfur containing heterocycles. CCS and the anion CCS− can be formed in solid neon matrices also. Properties CCS can be a ligand.

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material.

Despite or because of these difficulties, organocopper reagents are frequently generated and consumed in situ with no attempt to isolate them. They are used in organic synthesis as alkylating reagents because they exhibit greater functional group tolerance than corresponding Grignard and organolithium reagents. The electronegativity of copper is much higher than its next-door neighbor in the group 12 elements, zinc, suggesting diminished nucleophilicity for its carbon ligands. Copper salts react with terminal alkynes to form the acetylides. Alkyl halides react with organocopper compounds with inversion of configuration.

The electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group activates the nitrile group for nucleophilic additions. The high reactivity makes trichloroacetonitrile a versatile reagent, but also causes its susceptibility towards hydrolysis. Synthesis The production of trichloroacetonitrile by dehydration of trichloroacetamide was first described in 1873 by L. Bisschopinck at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

With carbon bonded to metals the field of organic chemistry crosses over into organometallic chemistry. Inorganic compounds",

When represented in chemical equations products are by convention drawn on the right-hand side, even in the case of reversible reactions.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

Preparation Dichlorocarbene is most commonly generated by reaction of chloroform and a base such as potassium tert-butoxide or aqueous sodium hydroxide. A phase transfer catalyst, for instance benzyltriethylammonium bromide, facilitates the migration of the hydroxide in the organic phase. HCCl3 + NaOH → CCl2 + NaCl + H2O Other reagents and routes Another precursor to dichlorocarbene is ethyl trichloroacetate. Upon treatment with sodium methoxide it releases CCl2. Phenyl(trichloromethyl)mercury decomposes thermally to release CCl2. PhHgCCl3 → CCl2 + PhHgCl Dichlorodiazirine, which is stable in the dark, decomposes into dichlorocarbene and nitrogen via photolysis.",

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones.

It can also be formed from malonic acid. It has been shown that carbon suboxide in an organism can quickly polymerize into macrocyclic polycarbon structures with the common formula (C3O2)n (mostly (C3O2)6 and (C3O2)8), and that those macrocyclic compounds are potent inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATP-ase and Ca-dependent ATP-ase, and have digoxin-like physiological properties and natriuretic and antihypertensive actions. Those macrocyclic carbon suboxide polymer compounds are thought to be endogenous digoxin-like regulators of Na+/K+-ATP-ases and Ca-dependent ATP-ases, and endogenous natriuretics and antihypertensives. Other than that, some authors think also that those macrocyclic compounds of carbon suboxide can possibly diminish free radical formation and oxidative stress and play a role in endogenous anticancer",

A disadvantage of these reactions is the requirement of a full equivalent of enantiopure starting material. (3) More recently, catalytic enantioselective methods have been developed based on the copper(I)-catalyzed conjugate addition of Grignard reactions to enones. The proposed mechanism involves transmetalation from the Grignard reagent to copper, conjugate addition, and rate-determining reductive elimination (see the analogous upper pathway in equation (2)).

In the next step a bisulfite anion adds to C3 through 1e. This results in the formation of 3a which tautomerizes to the more stable 3b to the sulfonic acid of tetralone. A nucleophilic addition follows of the amine with formation of 4a and its tautomer 4b loses water to form the resonance stabilized cation 5a. This compound is deprotonated to the imine 5b or the enamine 5c but an equilibrium exists between both species. The enamine eliminates sodium bisulfite with formation of naphthylamine 6. It is important to stress that this is a reversible reaction. The reaction is summarized as follows: The Bucherer carbazole synthesis is a related reaction. References",

The crystals were then isolated as a white solid in 75% yield. The dicarboxylated reaction product (bis-NHC)Si(CO3)2 was isolated and characterized using IR (νCO = 1746 cm−1) and 29Si{1H}-NMR (𝛿Si = 55.98 ppm). Crystallographic analysis of the complex revealed a SiIV center coordinated by two carbonate ligands in a distorted octahedral geometry. Carbon monoxide was also verified as a reaction product by means of carbon-13 NMR analysis using 13CO2 as a reactant.

Synthesis Classically acyl cyanides are produced by the salt metathesis reaction of acyl chlorides with sodium cyanide: RCOCl + NaCN → RC(O)CN + NaCl Alternatively, they can be produced by dehydration of acyl aldoximes: RC(O)CH=NOH → RC(O)CN + H2O Acetyl cyanide is also prepared by hydrocyanation of ketene: CH2=C=O + HCN → CH3C(O)CN Reactions They are mild acylating agents. With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

The SN1 mechanism has two steps. In the first step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+. In the second step, the nucleophilic reagent (Nuc:) attaches to the carbocation and forms a covalent sigma bond. If the substrate has a chiral carbon, this mechanism can result in either inversion of the stereochemistry or retention of configuration. Usually, both occur without preference. The result is racemization. The SN2 mechanism has just one step. The attack of the reagent and the expulsion of the leaving group happen simultaneously. This mechanism always results in inversion of configuration. If the substrate that is under nucleophilic attack is chiral, the reaction will therefore lead to an inversion of its stereochemistry, called a Walden inversion.",

Chloroform may also be produced on a small scale via the haloform reaction between acetone and sodium hypochlorite: 3 NaClO + (CH3)2CO → CHCl3 + 2 NaOH + CH3COONa Deuterochloroform",

In general, the more electron rich a carbonyl is, the faster the carbonyl group will be converted into the corresponding thiocarbonyl by Lawesson's reagent. Applications The chemistry of Lawesson's reagent and related substances has been reviewed by several times. The main use of Lawesson's reagent is the thionation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Lawesson's reagent will convert a carbonyl into a thiocarbonyl. Additionally, Lawesson's reagent has been used to thionate enones, esters, lactones, amides, lactams, and quinones. In one study, reaction of maltol with LR results in a selective oxygen replacement in two positions.",

As stated earlier, the reagent is prone to attack by nucleophiles such as amines and alcohols because of the electrophilic carbon. In the synthesis of cyanamides and dicyanamides, primary and secondary amines react with BrCN to yield mono- and dialkylcyanamides, which can further react with amines and hydroxylamine to yield guanidines and hydroxyguanidines. In the von Braun reaction, tertiary amines react with BrCN to yield disubstituted cyanamides and an alkyl bromide. Cyanogen bromide can be used to prepare aryl nitriles, nitriles, anhydrides, and cyanates. It can also serve as a cleaving agent. Cyanogen bromide is used in the synthesis of 4-methylaminorex (\"ice\") and viroxime. Toxicity, storage, and deactivation Cyanogen bromide can be stored under dry conditions at 2 to 8 °C for extended periods.",

It is a colorless solid that is widely used to modify biopolymers, fragment proteins and peptides (cuts the C-terminus of methionine), and synthesize other compounds. The compound is classified as a pseudohalogen. Synthesis, basic properties, and structure The carbon atom in cyanogen bromide is bonded to bromine by a single bond and to nitrogen by a triple bond (i.e. Br–C≡N). The compound is linear and polar, but it does not spontaneously ionize in water. It dissolves in both water and polar organic solvents. Cyanogen bromide can be prepared by oxidation of sodium cyanide with bromine, which proceeds in two steps via the intermediate cyanogen ((CN)2): 2 NaCN + Br2 → (CN)2 + 2 NaBr (CN)2 + Br2 → 2 (CN)Br",

Despite or because of these difficulties, organocopper reagents are frequently generated and consumed in situ with no attempt to isolate them. They are used in organic synthesis as alkylating reagents because they exhibit greater functional group tolerance than corresponding Grignard and organolithium reagents. The electronegativity of copper is much higher than its next-door neighbor in the group 12 elements, zinc, suggesting diminished nucleophilicity for its carbon ligands. Copper salts react with terminal alkynes to form the acetylides. Alkyl halides react with organocopper compounds with inversion of configuration.
