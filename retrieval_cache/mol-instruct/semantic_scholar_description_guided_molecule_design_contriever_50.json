VLCFAs accumulate in several tissues, such as the skin and testes, but are maintained at a lower level in other tissues and in the plasma (2). VLCFAs are transported by ABCD1 into the peroxisome where they are degraded by -oxidation. ABCD1 is the causative gene of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), an inherited disorder that displays wide phenotypic variability including childhood-onset cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) (3). X-ALD is the most common inherited peroxisomal disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1/20,000 births, and most of those affected are males (3). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been shown to provide long-term disease stabilization and survival (4, 5) and is thus one of the more promising treatment options for X-ALD. However, it remains necessary to develop drugs that can attenuate the progression of X-ALD in a patient-friendly therapeutic approach.VLCFA levels are significantly elevated in all male X-ALD patients, but the extent thereof is not correlated with the Abstract X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited disorder caused by deleterious mutations in the ABCD1 gene. The ABCD1 protein transports very long-chain FAs (VLCFAs) from the cytosol into the peroxisome where the VLCFAs are degraded through -oxidation. ABCD1 dysfunction leads to VLCFA accumulation in individuals with X-ALD. FAs are activated by esterification to CoA before metabolic utilization.

A marked biochemical deterioration in subjects with this disease is a defect of oxidation of VLCFAs. Since fibroblasts from these patients showed a very low activity in formation of very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, it has been considered that a new synthetase, VLACS being different from long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (6) must be present, and that the phenotypic etiology of X-ALD may be derived from a defect of this enzyme (7)(8)(9). The adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) gene has been cloned, and it was thought to be a disease-causing candidate for X-ALD (10). Various point mutations, deletions, and insertions in the gene have been identified in these patients (11)(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(20)(21). Retroviral transfer of normal ALDP cDNA into patient's fibroblasts enhanced VLCFA oxidation activity to the level found in control fibroblasts (22). These data indicate that ALDP is responsible for at least a part of X-ALD. The function of ALDP and the relation between ALDP and VLCFA oxidation activity are unknown. It is thus important to examine the exact localization in cells and the role of VLACS, catalyzing a crucial reaction in peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation, and the relation between ALDP and VLACS, including possible participation of 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (23), assigned as one of the ATPbinding cassette transporters (10,23).",

A number of human diseases are caused by defective VLCFA metabolism (Moser and Moser 1996). X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is characterized by an accumulation of free VLCFAs. It is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the ABCD1 transporter that imports VLCFAs into peroxisomes. These defects result in reduced peroxisomal degradation of VLCFAs and a concomitant increase in elongation (Kemp et al. 2005). VLCFAs accumulate in plasma and tissue of patients, resulting in a fatal neurodegenerative phenotype that can include childhood-onset cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) (Hama et al. 2020). AMN is the milder phenotype and is characterized by a slowly progressive axonopathy. Besides mutations in ABCD1 additional genetic or environmental factors are required to trigger brain inflammation. The phenotypic expression of the disease can vary extremely between patients. The correlation between genotype and different phenotypes remains unclear and does not allow to link severity of the pathology of X-ALD to any particular cellular mis-regulation. Stronger mutations can result in milder phenotypes (Wiesinger et al. 2015). Accumulating VLCFAs comprise C24:0, C26:0 and C26:1. Hexacosenoyl (26:1)-CoA is the most abundant VLCFA-CoA species in ABCD1-KO HeLa cells and X-ALD fibroblasts. C26:1-CoA levels are about fiveto six-fold higher than 26:0-CoA but the 26:1 and 26:0 VLCFA levels are similar. Even without ABCD1 there is still a turnover of VLCFAs indicating an ABCD1 independent machinery that metabolizes VLCFA-CoA (Hama et al. 2020). Interestingly, deletion of the VLCFA-CoA-synthetase FAT1 in S. cerevisiae results in decreased peroxisomal β-oxidation and elevated cellular VLCFA levels mimicking an X-ALD like phenotype.",

It has, however, a strong tendency to aggregate at high concentrations forming fluorescent species 12,13 . In addition to molarity, the optical properties of l-lysine depend on the pH of the solution. In aqueous solutions, l-lysine can occur as a cationic, an anionic, or zwitterionic molecule as a function of pH (Fig. 1). The net charge changes from + 2 at low pH (pH < 2.15), when the carboxylic groups and amino groups are all protonated, to + 1 in the case of deprotonation of the carboxylic and protonation of the amine groups (2.15 < pH < 10.62), to 0 when l-lysine is mainly in the zwitterionic form with the terminal ε-amino group of the aliphatic chain protonated and the carboxylic group deprotonated.

The conversion of chlorophyllide a to bacteriochlorophyllide a proceeded via reduction, hydration and subsequent dehydrogenation, respectively. The reduction of the double bond occurred at C7 and C8 of chlorophyllide a. The hydration of the vinyl group proceeded to form a hydroxyethyl group at C3.

Chlorophototrophic bacteria employ chlorophylls or bacteriochlorophylls to capture light as the source of energy for chemical synthesis [1]. The similar structures or relative compounds to bacteriochlorophyllides are shown in Figure 1. The structure features of bacteriochlorophyllide a were with tetrapyrroles, a dicarboxylic acid, a methyl ester, a methyl ketone and magnesium ion. Among them, tetrapyrroles are one of the macrocyclic compounds which existed in nature and played an important role in living organisms [2][3][4][5]. Previous study exhibited that bacteriochlorophyllides were found and accumulated in mutant strains of Rhodopseudomonas spheroids [6]. Bacteriochlorophyllides are the esterifying alcohol-free form of bacteriochlorophyll. In 1954, the preparation and conversion of bacteriochlorophyll into bacteriochlorophyllide in methanol by chlorophyllase was firstly described [7].\n\n\nA Brief History of Bacteriochlorophylls",

The first unusual finding is that rib5⌬ cells display a higher requirement for riboflavin than rib4⌬ cells (Fig. 1, C and D). The reaction catalyzed by Rib4p (lumazine synthase) is the condensation of 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione and 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate to form 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (lumazine), the immediate biosynthetic precursor of riboflavin. It is known from experiments in vitro that the formation of lumazine occurs spontaneously in aqueous solution at room temperature and at neutral pH (i.e. close to physiological conditions) (27). Although the in vitro reaction is rather slow compared with the enzyme-catalyzed reaction and proceeds with low regiospecificity (27), our findings demonstrate that spontaneous formation of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine indeed occurs in vivo and makes a significant contribution to the intracellular riboflavin available to rib4⌬ mutants.",

In order to synthesize deaza-forms of lumazines, we took inspiration from preparations of lumazine synthase inhibitors where the 5-nitrogen of the non-ribityl lumazine core was replaced with a carbon 20 (Fig. 1a). Specifically, we replaced the 5-nitrogen of the known ribityllumazine ligand 6,7-dimethyl-8-d-ribityllumazine (DMRL) or a monomethyl version of this ligand, 7-methyl-8-d-ribityllumazine, with a carbon to produce the known compounds 6,7-dimethyl-8-d-ribityldeazalumazine (deazalumazine or DZ) and 7-methyl-8-d-ribityldeazalumazine (monomethyl-DZ or mmDZ), respectively (Fig. 1b,c). Additionally, we prepared 2′-deoxy-DZ (dDZ) (Fig. 1d), lacking the 2′-hydroxyl of the ribityl moiety, and a deaza-version of photolumazine I (DZPLI, Fig. 1e), a novel MR1T cell-activating ribityllumazine ligand we recently described 13 . It is worth noting that the original design was to create a 5-deaza version of 5-OP-RU, but this compound spontaneously cyclized during synthesis to produce monomethyl-DZ.",

Acarbose is a fermentation product of the Actinoplanes species that competitively inhibits α-amylase and α-glucosidase [36,37]. Structurally, it is a pseudotetrasaccharide with an unsaturated cyclitol (2,3,4-trihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5,6-cyclohexene in a D-gluco configuration) attached to the nitrogen of 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-D-glucopyranose, which is linked α-(1->4) to maltose. By modifying the maltose unit at the reducing end, various analogues with different inhibition properties were obtained. For example, by removing one D-glucose unit from the reducing end of acarbose, acarviosine-glucose is obtained, which inhibits yeast α-glucosidase 430 times better than acarbose. Higher inhibition activity against pancreatic α-amylase was also obtained by substituting one maltose unit with isomaltose [38].",
