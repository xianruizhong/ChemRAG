Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

Several different strategies for library design have been developed to target the biologically relevant regions of chemical structure space. DOS has provided powerful probes to investigate biological mechanisms and also served as a new driving force for advancing synthetic organic chemistry.",

Its challenges lie in the areas of structure, reactivity, techniques, and concepts. Powerful structural tools reveal structures from biology that range from control of insect development and behavior to whole new metabolic pathways in humans. Unnatural products create beautiful new molecular shapes whose properties cannot be predicted as well as catalysts that function with enzyme-like control. From structure flows reactivity. Exploration of known reactions points to new directions, and development of new reactions offers the opportunity of streamlined synthetic design. Emerging new techniques offer new dimensions for performing and studying reactions as well as the hope for developing new ones. Merging disparate facts into unified concepts increases predictive capabilities. The extraordinary difficulty of finding the resultant of many small effects may obscure the presence of general theories, creates the art in the practice of the science, and challenges the practitioner. From these general themes derives the quest for selectivity--chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantio-. An examination of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications of organic chemistry reveals that, while impressive strides have been made, the science is best described as being between infancy and childhood. The cross-fertilization between organic chemistry and molecular biology vividly illustrates a merging of chemistry and biology.",

Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem-solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total synthesis.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself.

Nevertheless we have a lot to learn from nature. The efficient chemical synthesis of structural diversity (and complexity) is the aim of DOS. Highlights of this article include a discussion of nature's and synthetic chemists' strategies to obtain structural diversity and an analysis of molecular descriptors used to classify compounds.

We also differentiate between the synthesizability of the different best molecules found by the hatching on the bar, differentiating between three different cases: (1) the best molecule found (regardless of synthesizability) is shown with a circular hatched bar, (2) the best molecule found with a synthetic route with the diagonally hatched bar, and (3) the best molecule found which has a synthetic score greater than or equal to 0.9 is given a solid bar. Note that later bars occlude previous bars. The dotted gray line for each task represents the score one obtains if picking the best molecule in the training set.        5] we found that our approach was able to obtain very high scoring molecules quite easily, which meant that this score was less useful in investigating the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

Fragments were extracted from both biological compounds and known drugs. A fitness function guides the search process in optimizing the molecules toward an optimal value of the properties. The fitness function is build up by combining several independent property evaluations, including the score provided by the FlexX docking program. One application in de novo drug design is described. The example makes use of the structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis thymidine monophosphate kinase to generate analogues of one of its natural substrates.

Of equal interest has been elucidating what structural features within any given class of organic molecules are responsible for biological activity. Historically, the lack of satisfactory answers to both questions has relegated the development of biologically active molecules either to serendipity or to exhaustive synthesis and biological testing of large numbers of compounds. This frustration is particularly evident in the pharmaceutical industry where the development of drug agonists and antagonists is often time consuming, tedious and expensive. Fortunately, this picture is beginning to change as more information is derived from modern molecular modeling techniques including characterization of the active sites in enzymes and the ligand binding sites in receptors. Over the past 15 years another approach has emerged based upon a series of discoveries made in our laboratories with molecular models. Namely, many biologically active small molecules have been found to possess complementary stereochemical relationships with gene structure. These relationships have proven useful in understanding constraints imposed by nature on the structures of small molecules and in correlating structure with activity among certain classes of compounds. Recently, computer graphics and energy calculations have confirmed salient observations lending credence to what promises to be a powerful and rapidly evolving technology for designing new safe and effective drugs.",

This method is known as virtual screening. A second category is de novo design of new ligands.

These pieces can be either individual atoms or molecular fragments. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures, not contained in any database, can be suggested.

While the tenets of the field were originally implicitly founded on the use of chemistry to create those parts, its modern incarnation has focused on the use of parts assembled from natural components or components intended to mimic their natural counterparts. This would seem justified by the eons of evolution that optimized the natural components for functioning in a cell, at least for a similar function. However, most natural components are recognized by or interact with multiple other components in every cell, possibly in unknown ways, and thus their introduction may have unintended consequences. While truly synthetic parts made by chemists do not benefit from eons of evolution, they are foreign to cells, possibly even drawing upon forces not used by their natural counterparts, and thus they may be more orthogonal and possibly easier to introduce and optimize without perturbation. In this case, optimization must proceed with less information, because less is known about how the parts might interact with their biological targets, and the methodology and lessons of medicinal chemistry, which conceptually face essentially the same challenges, provide the blueprint for success. If the combination of synthetic and medicinal-like chemistry can produce molecules that function alongside those evolved by nature for the most central of its processes, to store and retrieve information, then this approach is likely to be capable of discovering molecules that effectively participate in any biological process, potentially opening a new vista for chemists in synthetic biology.   \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank former and current members of the Romesberg group, as well as those of our collaborators in the Dwyer and Marx groups for their contributions to the research highlighted in this Account.\n\n\u25a0 REFERENCES\n\nFigure 1 .\n1dNaM-dTPT3, dZ-dP, and dDs-dPx (R = H or \u2212CH(OH)\u2212CH 2 OH) UBPs.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2(A) First generation methylated benzene and naphthalene analogs.

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

A copy of the descendants of v e will be attached to v in m, and the rest of the nodes in the rule have to match v and above. We call the descendants of v e as expanding nodes and all the other nodes as matching nodes. Example: In Figure 4(a), we present a rule. It has two kinds of nodes. The rule adds the square node (v e ). The circular nodes are the pattern, which must be present in the molecule to apply the rule. In Figure 4(b), we present an application of the rule. The solid tree with three nodes is the initial molecule. The middle node A and its right child B form a pattern, where the rule is applicable. The rule adds a left child with the label A to the middle node. The rule is not applicable at the root A due to pattern mismatch. We naturally extend the definitions related to molecules, including M atch and Copy, to the production rules. Let us formally define the molecule productions using the rules. Let m = (V, M, C, v 0 ) be a molecule and r = (V r , M r , C r , v 0r , v e ) be a production rule. Let d be such that v 0r = ancestor(r, v e , d), i.e., v e is at the depth d in r.

Synthesizability, stability and the sensibleness depend on the application area, are difficult to define, and can all appear subtle to non-chemists. For example, although we can encode a simple notion of syntactic correctness through valency constraints (for instance having maximally four substituents at a carbon atom), these do not guarantee that a molecule is semantically valid. Semantic validity is not trivial to define, and can be related to stability or the presence of undesirable substructures. For instance, a molecule consisting of a chain of 10 nitrogen atoms with alternating single and double bonds would satisfy valency constraints, but would unlikely be stable; it would decompose or explode immediately! We can view VS as being on one end of this tradeoff between chemical coverage and synthesizability/stability. By using pre-defined virtual libraries, we are limited in chemical coverage but can ensure that all the molecules included are sensible and synthesizable. This for instance is sometimes done by generating the library by iterating over a set of readily available starting materials, and combining them using virtual reaction schemes [14].\n\nInhabiting the other end of this tradeoff, would be a completely unconstrained de novo design algorithm, allowing any connecting bond between any atoms to construct the molecular graph. Although such an algorithm covers every conceivable molecule, it would generate structures not even meeting valency constraints. This can be remedied by the hand-coding of expert rules, e.g.\n\n[58]. However, arguably a more scalable approach was the development of algorithms that constructed molecules through combining together larger, sensible fragments [77] and later algorithms that constructed molecules iteratively by combining together building blocks via virtual reaction schemes [34,95]. However, even with these approaches there is still the problem of how best to search through this action space, a difficult discrete optimization problem, and so these algorithms often resorted to optimizing greedily one-step at a time or using genetic algorithms.",

Extensions of this approach have therefore investigated representing Ap.-19 molecules with grammars [19, 53], and explicit constrained graph representations or molecular fragments [43-45, 56,\nCode is provided at https://github.com/john-bradshaw/synthesis-dags.\nWe reimplemented the CVAE and GVAE models in PyTorch and found that our implementation is significantly better than [53]'s published results. We believe this is down to being able to take advantage of some of the latest techniques for training these models (for example \u03b2-annealing[2, 35]) as well as hyperparameter tuning.\nNote, like reaction predictors, these tools are imperfect, but still (we believe) offer a sensible current method for evaluating our models.\nAp.-20\nAcknowledgments and Disclosure of FundingThis work was supported by The Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRC grant EP/N510129/1.

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

Highlights of this article include a discussion of nature's and synthetic chemists' strategies to obtain structural diversity and an analysis of molecular descriptors used to classify compounds.

With the avalanche of bioinformatics data, de novo design is ideally suited for exploring molecules that could be useful for chemical genomics. The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

About 50% of the reactions in the dataset are ring-forming reactions, which fosters the assembly of novel ring systems and innovative chemotypes. A comparison with a recent survey of the reactions used in early drug discovery revealed considerable overlaps with the collection presented here.

This arrangement differs from the \"hairpin\" or approximately parallel disposition of side chains observed for other prostaglandins. The omega chain, which normally turns at the 15-hydroxyl back toward the alpha chain, is fully extended. The conformation is stabilized by the conjugation of the dienone chromophore. The 15-hydroxyl, which is normally directed away from the centroid of the prostaglandin in the hairpin model, is turned inward in L-shaped PGB1. The low biological activity of PGB1 in many systems and especially its inhibition of the metabolizing enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase may be attributable directly to the observed L-shape conformation.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

This approach seeks to identify the structural unit or pharmacophore responsible for the desired activity. Such pharmacophores have been the start point for a wide range of lead generation and optimisation programmes using techniques such as Biology Oriented Synthesis, Diversity Oriented Synthesis, Diverted Total Synthesis, and Fragment Based Drug Discovery.

The software DOGS (Design of Genuine Structures) features a ligand-based strategy for automated 'in silico' assembly of potentially novel bioactive compounds. The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software. The computational approach proved to be suitable for scaffold-hopping from known ligands to novel chemotypes, and for generating bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.",

Several complex natural products have now been synthesised by solid-phase methods and have created the foundation for preparation of combinatorial libraries. In other examples, natural products or intermediates have served as building blocks or scaffolds in the synthesis of complex natural products, bioactive analogues or designed hybrid molecules. Finally, structural motifs from the biologically active parent molecule have been identified and have served for design of natural product mimicry, which facilitates the creation of combinatorial libraries.",

Each reaction step takes a set of molecules and physically combines them under suitable conditions to produce a new molecule. The set of molecules that react together are selected from a pool of molecules that are available at that point. This pool consists of a large set of initial, easy-to-obtain starting molecules (building blocks) and the intermediate products already created. The reaction steps continue in this manner until the final molecule M T is produced, where we make the assumption that all reactions are deterministic and produce a single primary product.\n\nFor example, consider the synthesis pathway for paracetamol, in Figure 1, which we will use as a running example to illustrate our approach. Here, the initial, easy-to-obtain building block molecules  Figure 1, with the corresponding DAG at that point in the sequence shown for three different time-points in the grey circles. The serialized construction sequence consists of a sequence of actions. These actions can be classified into belonging to three different types: (A1) node addition, (A2) building block molecular identity, and (A3) connectivity choice. By convention we start at the building block node that is furthest from the final product node, sampling randomly when two nodes are at equivalent distances.\n\nare shown in blue boxes. Reactions are signified with arrows, which produce a product molecule (outlined in green) from reactants. These product molecules can then become reactants themselves.\n\nIn general, this multi-step reaction pathway forms a synthesis DAG, which we shall denote M. Specifically, note that it is directed from reactants to products, and it is not cyclic, as we do not need to consider reactions that produce already obtained reactants.\n\n\nOur Models\n\nHere we describe a generative model of synthesis DAGs. This model can be used flexibly as part of a larger architecture or model, as shown in the second half of this section.\n\n\nA probabilistic generative model of synthesis DAGs",

While known drugs and bioactive compounds are mostly aromatic and planar, the GDBs contain a plethora of non-aromatic 3D-shaped molecules, which are very useful for drug discovery since they generally have more desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Here we review GDB enumeration methods and the selection and synthesis of GDB molecules as modulators of ion channels.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state.

All affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids, particularly hexacosanoate (C26:0), because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids. This degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome, and ALD, together with Zellweger's cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of peroxisomal disorders. Biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis, as well as identification of most heterozygotes. We have identified 303 patients with ALD in 217 kindreds. These patients show a wide phenotypic variation. Sixty percent of patients had childhood ALD and 17% adrenomyeloneuropathy, both of which are X-linked, with the gene mapped to Xq28. Neonatal ALD, a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to Zellweger's syndrome, accounted for 7% of the cases. Although excess C26:0 in the brain of patients with ALD is partially of dietary origin, dietary C26:0 restriction did not produce clear benefit. Bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma C26:0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression.",

A defect in peroxisomal beta-oxidation results in elevated levels of VLCFAs and is associated with the most frequent inherited disorder of the central nervous system white matter, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Recently, we demonstrated that VLCFAs can also undergo omega-oxidation, which may provide an alternative route for the breakdown of VLCFAs. The omega-oxidation of VLCFA is initiated by CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B, which produce omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs. In this article, we characterized the enzymes involved in the formation of very-long-chain dicarboxylic acids from omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs. We demonstrate that very-long-chain dicarboxylic acids are produced via two independent pathways. The first is mediated by an as yet unidentified, microsomal NAD(+)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is encoded by the ALDH3A2 gene and is deficient in patients with Sj\u00f6gren-Larsson syndrome. The second pathway involves the NADPH-dependent hydroxylation of omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs by CYP4F2, CYP4F3B, or CYP4F3A.

In this study, we investigated the role of VLCFA biosynthesis in X-ALD fibroblasts. Our data demonstrate that elongation of both saturated and mono-unsaturated VLCFAs is enhanced in fibroblasts from patients with peroxisomal beta-oxidation defects including X-ALD, and peroxisome biogenesis disorders. These data indicate that enhanced VLCFA elongation is a general phenomenon associated with an impairment in peroxisomal beta-oxidation, and not specific for X-ALD alone. Analysis of plasma samples from patients with X-ALD and different peroxisomal beta-oxidation deficiencies revealed increased concentrations of VLCFAs up to 32 carbons. We infer that enhanced elongation does not result from impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation alone, but is due to the additional effect of unchecked chain elongation. We demonstrate that elongated VLCFAs are incorporated into complex lipids. The role of chain elongation was also studied retrospectively in samples from patients with X-ALD previously treated with \"Lorenzo's oil.\" We found that the decrease in plasma C26:0 previously found is offset by the increase of mono-unsaturated VLCFAs, not measured previously during the trial. We conclude that evaluation of treatment protocols for disorders of peroxisomal beta-oxidation making use of plasma samples should include the measurement of saturated and unsaturated VLCFAs of chain lengths above 26 carbon atoms. We also conclude that chain elongation offers an interesting target to be studied as a possible mode of treatment for X-ALD and other peroxisomal beta-oxidation disorders.",

The metabolic functions of these organelles include synthesis of plasmalogens and other ether lipids, beta-oxidation, especially of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs, &gt; C22) and their derivatives, inactivation of hydrogen peroxide by peroxisomal catalase and involvement in several other metabolic pathways, e.g. gluconeogenesis, catabolism of purines and polyamines and detoxification of ethanol. Peroxisomal diseases which may arise from genetic faults in the biogenesis of the organelle or aberrant targeting of one or more proteins to the peroxisome, are divided into three groups based on the extent of loss of peroxisomal functions. Prototype of the first group is the cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome of Zellweger (ZS) which shows generalised loss of peroxisomal functions and absence of demonstrable mature peroxisomes in the liver. Other syndromes which are briefly discussed include neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD) and infantile Refsum syndrome (IRS) which may be regarded as milder variants of ZS, and diseases caused by loss of a limited number of peroxisomal functions (rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctate). However, the group of peroxisomal diseases with the highest incidence are those syndromes where only a single peroxisomal function is impaired. The most common peroxisomal disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD) belongs to this group. XALD develops as a result of an isolated defect of peroxisomal acyl-CoA synthetase with resultant accumulation of VLCFAs, especially C26:0. Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is caused by deficient activity of peroxisomal alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase due to aberrant targeting of this enzyme to mitochondria and not peroxisomes, a unique example of a genetic enzyme trafficking defect. The primary diagnosis of these syndromes is usually based on clinical findings and measurement of accumulated or depleted metabolites in the body e.g. VLCFAs, bile acid intermediates, phytanic acid, pipecolic acid and plasmalogens. Therapy includes dietary adjustments e.g. supplementation with oleic acid derivatives to normalise elevated VLCFAs in XALD. Treatment with hypolipidaemic drugs and certain peroxisomal substrates which induce proliferation of mature peroxisomes offers promise in the therapy of these debilitating and often fatal diseases.",

Three peroxisomal ABC proteins belonging to subfamily D have been identified in mammalian peroxisomes that have an important role in fatty acid metabolism. ABCD1/ALDP and ABCD2/ALDRP are suggested to be involved in the transport of very long chain acyl-CoA, and ABCD3/PMP70 is involved in the transport of long chain acyl-CoA. ABCD1 is known to be responsible for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD); an inborn error of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids. X-ALD is characterized biochemically by the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in all tissues, including the brain white matter. Progressive demyelination of the central nervous system and adrenal dysfunction have been observed. The pharmacological up-regulation of peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and the suppression of fatty acid elongation are important aspects of an optimal therapeutic approach. Attractive targets for the treatment of X-ALD patients include the ABCD2 as well as elongase that is involved in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids. In addition, stabilization of mutant ABCD1 that has retained some of its function might be another approach, since most of the mutant ABCD1s with a missense mutation are degraded rapidly by proteasomes before or after targeting to peroxisomes. Protection of the central nervous system against oxidative damage is also important in order to delay the progress of disease. We summarize recent pharmaceutical studies and consider the potential for future X-ALD therapies.",

Lorenzo's oil, a 4:1 mixture of glyceryl trioleate and glyceryl trierucate, has been used to reduce the saturated VLCFA level in the plasma of X-ALD patients; however, the mechanism by which this occurs remains elusive. We report the biochemical characterization of Lorenzo's oil activity toward elongation of very long-chain fatty acid (ELOVL) 1, the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of saturated and monounsaturated VLCFAs. Oleic and erucic acids inhibited ELOVL1, and, moreover, their 4:1 mixture (the FA composition of Lorenzo's oil) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity. The kinetics analysis revealed that this was a mixed (not a competitive) inhibition. At the cellular level, treatment with the 4:1 mixture reduced the level of SM with a saturated VLCFA accompanied by an increased level of SM with a monounsaturated VLCFA, probably due to the incorporation of erucic acid into the FA elongation cycle. These results suggest that inhibition of ELOVL1 may be an underlying mechanism by which Lorenzo's oil exerts its action. ",

The biochemical characterization is based on the accumulation of pathgnomonic amounts of saturated very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA; C&gt;22) in all tissues, including the brain white matter, adrenal glands, and skin fibroblasts, of the patients. The accumulation of VLCFA in ALD is linked to a mutation in the ALD (ABCD1) gene, an ABC subfamily D member. The ALD gene product, so-called ALDP (ABCD1), is thought to be involved in the transport of VLCFA or VLCFA-CoA into the peroxisomes. ALDP is a half-sized peroxisomal ABC protein and it has 745 amino acids in humans. ALDP is thought to be synthesized on free polysomes, posttranslationally transported to peroxisomes, and inserted into the membranes. During this process, ALDP interacts with Pex19p, a chaperone-like protein for intracellular trafficking of peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP), the complex targets Pex3p on the peroxisomal membranes, and ALDP is inserted into the membranes. After integration into the membranes, ALDP is thought to form mainly homodimers. Here, we chose nine arbitrary mutations of human ALDP with naturally occurring missense mutations and examined the intracellular behavior of their ALDPs. We found that mutant ALDP (S606L, R617H, and H667D) was degraded together with wild-type ALDP by proteasomes. These results suggest that the complex of mutant and wild-type ALDP is recognized as misfolded proteins and degraded by the protein quality control system associated with proteasomes. Further, we found fragmentation of mutant ALDP (R104C) on peroxisomes and it was not inhibited by proteasomes inhibitors, suggesting that an additional protease(s) is also involved in the quality control of mutant ALDP. In addition, mutation of ALDP (Y174C) suggests that a loop between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 is important for the targeting of ALDP to peroxisomes.",

The extreme variability in clinical phenotype, even within one affected family, indicates that besides the ALD gene mutations other factors strongly influence the clinical phenotype. To understand the cell biology and function of mammalian peroxisomal ABC transporters and to determine their role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD we developed a system for expressing functional ABC protein domains in fusion with the maltose binding protein. Wild type and mutant fusion proteins of the nucleotide-binding fold were overexpressed, purified, and characterized by photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido ATP or 8-azido GTP and a coupled ATP regenerating enzyme assay for ATPase activity. Our studies provide evidence that peroxisomal ABC transporters utilize ATP to become a functional transporter and that ALD gene mutations alter peroxisomal transport function. The established disease model will be used further to study the influence of possible disease modifier proteins on ALDP function.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

However, the chemical structure of natural products covers a wide spectrum from very simple to complex. With more complex structures it is often desirable to simplify the molecule whilst retaining the desired biological activity. This approach seeks to identify the structural unit or pharmacophore responsible for the desired activity. Such pharmacophores have been the start point for a wide range of lead generation and optimisation programmes using techniques such as Biology Oriented Synthesis, Diversity Oriented Synthesis, Diverted Total Synthesis, and Fragment Based Drug Discovery. This review discusses the literature precedence of simplification strategies in four areas of natural product research: proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and compounds isolated from natural product extracts, and their impact on identifying therapeutic products.

In this Perspective, we discuss a design approach for the preparation of biologically relevant small-molecule libraries, harnessing the unprecedented combination of NP-derived fragments as an overarching strategy for the synthesis of new bioactive compounds. These novel 'pseudo-natural product' classes retain the biological relevance of NPs, yet exhibit structures and bioactivities not accessible to nature or through the use of existing design strategies. We also analyse selected pseudo-NP libraries using chemoinformatic tools, to assess their molecular shape diversity and properties. To facilitate the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space, we identify design principles and connectivity patterns that would provide access to unprecedented pseudo-NP classes, offering new opportunities for bioactive small-molecule discovery.",

In recent years, however, the field has acquired momentum as its power to reach higher molecular complexity and diversity is increasing, and as the demand for rare bioactive natural products and their analogues is expanding due to their recognised potential to facilitate biology and drug discovery and development. Today this component of total synthesis endeavors is considered highly desirable, and could be part of interdisciplinary academic and/or industrial partnerships, providing further inspiration and momentum to the field. In this review we provide a brief historical background of the emergence of the field of total synthesis as it relates to making molecules for biology and medicine.

For each molecule that they describe, the authors present a historical background, photographs of the main protagonists (we also need to know the faces and not only the names of the scientists who spend their lives for the benefit of humanity) and a description of the synthesis of the compound. I was fascinated to learn that salicin (the precursor of aspirin W ) was advocated in ancient Egypt some 3,500 years ago. The ancient Egyptians knew about the beneficial effects of myrtle bark (which contains salicin) on rheumatism and back pain. Similar is the story for the discovery of steroids from Mexican yams. And if you are ready for some mystery and intrigue, read the story of strychnine and how it was used as a poison for murder, along with other alkaloids, such as hemlock, which was used to execute Socrates. The discovery of Taxol W was the result of a major effort in the USA from 1960 to 1981 to identify anticancer ingredients from natural sources (did you know that 110,000 substances from 35,000 plant species were tested?). However, natural compounds are often very difficult to isolate in large quantities from plants. Thus, Taxol's total chemical synthesis (led by the Nicolaou and Holton teams) provided a drug that was much needed. The book appropriately ends with chapters on small molecules and biologics (antiviral agents and vaccines) and their importance in many different genetic diseases. This is the style for all the molecules in the book. You do not need to be a chemist to enjoy and follow the book. I highly recommend this elegant and unique book for every scientist and even for nonscientists with a desire to learn the effects of scientific endeavors in human history. It is a major achievement for the field and rightly so foreworded by two Nobel Prize winners, E.J. Corey and Ryoji Noyori.\n \u00a9 2012 Tsonis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

For example, a molecule with three points of diversity (R1, R2, and R3) can generate possible structures, where , , and are the numbers of different substituents utilized. The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

The latter includes mutasynthesis, the synthesis of natural products encoded by silent genes, and propionate scanning. Most of the examples from our group fall in the quite general concept of DTS. Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis. However, even for compounds of moderate complexity, organic synthesis remains a bottle neck. Unless some method for predicting the biological activity of a designed molecule becomes available, the design and synthesis of natural product analogues will remain what it is now, namely it will largely rely on trial and error.

Our approach generates hundreds of thousands of new binding site definitions in an automated fashion for arbitrary target ligand conformations, regardless of whether a complete binding site definition can be derived from an existing complex in the PDB. These binding site definitions yield thousands of RosettaMatch solutions that agree well with originally defined geometries. We also introduce a new design method that recapitulates key interactions in ligand binding sites. Moreover, we show that the new design method improves several metrics in design that are predictive of success when designs are experimentally characterized. While we have incorporated these new methods in Rosetta, the principles are generally applicable to other design approaches. The methods introduced here will have broad utility to design binders for arbitrary small molecules, towards predictable design of small molecule sensors, inducible transcription factors, and other functional proteins.2",

With the avalanche of bioinformatics data, de novo design is ideally suited for exploring molecules that could be useful for chemical genomics. The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human-driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

These novel 'pseudo-natural product' classes retain the biological relevance of NPs, yet exhibit structures and bioactivities not accessible to nature or through the use of existing design strategies.

It is a benchmark that encompasses several metrics that assess the generated molecules in order to characterize a given method. One of the important metrics is novelty. It is a proportion of generated molecules that are not seen in the initial database, i.e. the training set. Filters is a metric that measures the proportion of molecules that are passed through the custom medicinal chemistry filters (MCFs) and PAINS filters 2 . These filters were hand-picked to exclude molecules with specific undesired properties, such as reactivity and chelation. IntDiv 1 and IntDiv 2 assess the internal diversity of the generated molecules and their values range between 0 and 1. A low score indicates that the generated molecules are limited in the variety of scaffolds and a high score corresponds to a higher inner diversity of the molecules. IntDiv 1 and IntDiv 2 can be calulated as follows\nIntDiv p (G) = 1 \u2212 p 1 |G| 2 m1,m2\u2208G T (m 1 , m 2 ) p ,\nwhere G stands for the set of molecules, T stands for Tanimoto distance, m 1 and m 2 stand for any pair of molecules in the set G and p \u2208 1, 2.\n\nAs can be seen from Table S1, aside from GrammarVae and MolCycleGAN the algorithms have shown they are able to produce a large portion of novel, never-seen-before molecules. The internal diversity score also shows high values across all 10 algorithms.   Table S2, and it showcases that for the most part, the differences in variances of each subset along each property is statistically significant.

The software DOGS (Design of Genuine Structures) features a ligand-based strategy for automated 'in silico' assembly of potentially novel bioactive compounds. The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software. The computational approach proved to be suitable for scaffold-hopping from known ligands to novel chemotypes, and for generating bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.",

In the past decades numerous cyclodepsipeptides have been isolated and their potential as drugs has been studied extensively. For several cyclodepsipeptides total syntheses both in solution and on solid-phase have been established, allowing the production of combinatorial libraries. In addition, the biosynthesis of specific cyclodepsipeptides has been elucidated and used for the chemoenzymatic preparation of nonnatural analogues. This review summarizes the recent literature on cyclic tetra- to decadepsipeptides, composed exclusively of \u03b1-amino- and \u03b1-hydroxy acids. ",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Among those are the cyclodepsipeptides, hybrid structures composed of amino and hydroxy acids. In the past decades numerous cyclodepsipeptides have been isolated and their potential as drugs has been studied extensively. For several cyclodepsipeptides total syntheses both in solution and on solid-phase have been established, allowing the production of combinatorial libraries. In addition, the biosynthesis of specific cyclodepsipeptides has been elucidated and used for the chemoenzymatic preparation of nonnatural analogues. This review summarizes the recent literature on cyclic tetra-to decadepsipeptides, composed exclusively of \u03b1-amino-and \u03b1-hydroxy acids.\n\nIntroduction",

Furthermore, pharmacophore models can be used to identify through de novo design or virtual screening novel ligands that will bind to the same receptor. Features Typical pharmacophore features include hydrophobic centroids, aromatic rings, hydrogen bond acceptors or donors, cations, and anions.

There are four types of nucleotides distinguished by which of the four nucleobases they contain: in DNA these are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will bind to each other to form a double helix only if the two sequences are complementary, that is, they can form matching sequences of base pairs. Thus, in nucleic acids the sequence determines the pattern of binding and thus the overall structure. Nucleic acid design is the process by which, given a desired target structure or functionality, sequences are generated for nucleic acid strands which will self-assemble into that target structure.

Applying these concepts, we explain how to use Rosetta energies to identify and analyze the features of biomolecular models.

Historical developments, along with experimental and computational efforts, leading up to the birth of the hydrogen bond concept, the discovery of nonclassical hydrogen bonds (C-H\u2026O, O-H\u2026\u03c0, dihydrogen bonding), and the proposal of hydrogen bond design principles (e.g., secondary electrostatic interactions, resonance-assisted hydrogen bonding, and aromaticity effects) are outlined.

Our approach generates hundreds of thousands of new binding site definitions in an automated fashion for arbitrary target ligand conformations, regardless of whether a complete binding site definition can be derived from an existing complex in the PDB. These binding site definitions yield thousands of RosettaMatch solutions that agree well with originally defined geometries. We also introduce a new design method that recapitulates key interactions in ligand binding sites. Moreover, we show that the new design method improves several metrics in design that are predictive of success when designs are experimentally characterized. While we have incorporated these new methods in Rosetta, the principles are generally applicable to other design approaches. The methods introduced here will have broad utility to design binders for arbitrary small molecules, towards predictable design of small molecule sensors, inducible transcription factors, and other functional proteins.2",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

However, there are currently only a small number of guiding synthetic strategies available to generate novel NP-inspired scaffolds, limiting both the number and types of compounds accessible. In this Perspective, we discuss a design approach for the preparation of biologically relevant small-molecule libraries, harnessing the unprecedented combination of NP-derived fragments as an overarching strategy for the synthesis of new bioactive compounds. These novel 'pseudo-natural product' classes retain the biological relevance of NPs, yet exhibit structures and bioactivities not accessible to nature or through the use of existing design strategies. We also analyse selected pseudo-NP libraries using chemoinformatic tools, to assess their molecular shape diversity and properties. To facilitate the exploration of biologically relevant chemical space, we identify design principles and connectivity patterns that would provide access to unprecedented pseudo-NP classes, offering new opportunities for bioactive small-molecule discovery.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The frequency of the overall similarity coefficient is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the similarity span of molecules generated by the R group model is large, and many of the generated molecules have low similarity, and the number of molecules with research value is small; Most of the molecules generated by this model have a similarity interval of [60%, 90%]. The number of low similarity molecules is very small, and there are many molecules with research value. The test data show that the model in this paper shows good performance in terms of the similarity of the molecules generated from the zinc molecular data set. Figure 6. The molecule generated by the two models is similar to the original molecule In addition to the similarity shown in formation of a single new molecule, the molecular diversity shown in the formation of multiple new molecules is also important because it reflects the density of molecules in the underlying space [31] . The denser the molecules encoded in the potential space, the more kinds of molecules can be decoded, and the better the chemical space can be explored. To verify that SELFIES can increase the molecular density of potential Spaces, we'll use SELFIES and SMILES for experimental verification in this article. After training the data of both molecular representations using the models presented in this paper, a molecule was randomly selected from the test set and 200 samples were taken for each model respectively. The number of valid molecules was also calculated for the model using SMILES, after which similarity was sorted and statistical calculations were performed. We found that the model trained with SELFIES produced 77.5% of diverse molecules, while the model trained with SMILES produced 40.59% of diverse molecules, as shown in Figure 7. The SMILES curve often appears parallel to the horizontal axis, which indicates that the molecules in this part are the same. We shot a few times in parallel, which means that most of the molecules are different.",

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesAs it is frequently the case that authentic samples of the natural product are unavailable to synthetic chemists for further analysis (more refined NMR techniques, derivatization experiments, etc), quantum chemical calculations of NMR properties emerge as a powerful and simple option to shed light on structural or stereochemical issues. 11The high accuracy provided by quantum chemically computed NMR shifts and coupling constants has been extensively employed in recent years to facilitate the determination of the tridimensional structure of a wide variety of organic molecules.Since the seminal reports of Bagno et al. 12 and Bifulco and co-workers, 12 the use of NMR calculations in structural organic chemistry have been widely spread.Extensive work by several research teams have been conducted to study different aspects of NMR calculations, 13 and excellent reviews were published covering the state of the art of this discipline. 11part from the choice of the level of theory to be employed in NMR calculation procedure, another critical aspect for structural elucidation purposes is the strategy to correlate the results of such calculations with the available experimental data, in order to manage the judgment action (for instance, decide the most likely structure of a given molecule).Naturally, all the different approaches share the same premise that the correct structure is expected to show a better match between experimental and simulated NMR data, but the differences between them arise on how such agreement is computed.For example, simple and easy-tocompute statistical parameters of correlation have been typically used to quantify the goodness of fit between different candidate structures.Among them, correlation coefficient (R 2 ) values, mean absolute error (MAE), corrected mean absolute error (CMAE) and maximum errors represent the most common parameters. 11More recently, new and sophisticated procedures to correlate experimental and calculated NMR data were introduced to increase the level of confidence and facilitate the structural assignment in different scenarios.For instance, the Goodman's CP3 parameter was thought to assign two sets of experimental NMR data to two plausible structures, 14 whereas the DP4 probability was created by the same group to determine the most likely structure when only one set of experimental NMR data is available. 15This last method, and the updated version DP4+ developed by the Sarotti and co-workers, 16 are among the most popular strategies to unravel the tridimensional structure of elusive molecules otherwise difficult to assign.The use of artificially-created neural networks to detect structural and/or stereochemical misassignments using pattern recognition analysis from",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms.

Proven strategies include diverted total synthesis (DTS), function-oriented synthesis (FOS), biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), complexity to diversity (CtD), hybrid molecules, and biosynthesis inspired synthesis. The latter includes mutasynthesis, the synthesis of natural products encoded by silent genes, and propionate scanning. Most of the examples from our group fall in the quite general concept of DTS. Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis. However, even for compounds of moderate complexity, organic synthesis remains a bottle neck. Unless some method for predicting the biological activity of a designed molecule becomes available, the design and synthesis of natural product analogues will remain what it is now, namely it will largely rely on trial and error.

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple non-overlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on a modified version of the Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator. The results obtained, i.e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck.",

Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

In another strategy divergent synthesis starts from a molecule as a central core from which successive generations of building blocks are added. A good example is the divergent synthesis of dendrimers, for example, where in each generation a new monomer reacts to the growing surface of the sphere.

As such they can be regarded as non-biogenic fusions of NP-derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human-driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.",

The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software.

This significantly reduces the structural flexibility of the polypeptide chain, and the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine ring cannot participate in hydrogen bonding with other residues [103]. Many biologically-important cyclic peptide sequences and natural products contain multiple proline residues. As seen previously for peptide bonds, the proline amide bond can also exist in trans or cis conformations (Figure 4). Peptide bonds to proline, and to other N-substituted amino acids, are able to populate both the cis and trans isomers. Most peptide bonds overwhelmingly adopt the trans isomer (typically 99.9% under unstrained conditions), because the amide hydrogen (trans isomer) offers less steric repulsion to the preceding C \u03b1 atom than does the following C \u03b1 atom (cis isomer). By contrast, the cis and trans isomers of the X-Pro peptide bond (where X represents any amino acid) both experience steric clashes with the neighboring substitution and are nearly equal energetically. Hence, the fraction of X-Pro peptide bonds in the cis isomer under unstrained conditions ranges from 10% to 40%; the fraction depends slightly on the preceding amino acid, with aromatic residues favoring the cis isomer slightly. Proline cis-trans isomerization plays a key role in the rate-determining steps of protein folding [104]. Furthermore, proline cis-trans isomerization controls autoinhibition of a signaling protein [105].",

The absolute configuration of proline residue can be determined by Marfey's method using reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-L-alanineamide (FDAA) [107]. The absolute configuration of amino proline was determined by comparing the retention time with the standard FDAA-derivatized amino acids, e.g., the structure of cyclooctapeptide reniochalistatin E contains three L-proline units with trans conformation [20] whereas the structure of cycloheptapeptide euryjanicin E contains three L-proline units with cis conformation [88]. Further, a novel cyclic tetrapeptide isolated from a Pseudomonas sp. (strain IM-1) associated with the marine sponge Ircinia muscarum was found to contain two proline units, one with L-configuration and the other with D-configuration [77].",

The role of proline in these molecules has been linked to the control of the conformation of the molecule in solution because of the restricted \u03c6 of proline. The proline-rich cyclic peptides (PRCPs) are formed by linking one end of the peptide and the other with an amide bond or other chemically-stable bonds. Some of them are used in the clinic, e.g., gramicidin S and tyrocidine with bactericidal activity, while others are in clinical trials, e.g., dehydrodidemnin B, and most of them originate from natural resources. Although the literature is enriched with reports concerned with marine-derived linear proline-rich bioactive peptides [1][2][3][4][5], e.g., dolastatin 15, kurahyne B, jahanyne, cemadotin, koshikamide A 1 , etc., PRCPs from marine   \n\n\nStability and Comparison with Linear Peptides\n\nLinear peptides that contain less than 10 amino acid residues are especially flexible in solution. Once the length of linear peptides extends to between 10 and 20 amino acid residues, random linear peptide sequences can begin to obtain secondary structures, including \u03b1-helices, turns and \u03b2-strands. These secondary structures impose constraints that reduce the free energy of linear peptides and limit their conformations to those that may be more biologically active. The constraints imposed by cyclization force cyclic peptides to adopt a limited number of molecular conformations in solution. Generally, if cyclization limits conformations to those required for optimum receptor binding, these cyclic peptides would be more useful compared with their linear counterparts that can adopt more conformations, which are not useful for receptor binding. Cyclization has been shown to increase the propensity for \u03b2-turn formation in peptides, which is of vital utility since \u03b2-turns are often found in native proteins. Although peptide cyclization generally induces structural constraints, the site of cyclization within the sequence can affect the binding affinity of cyclic peptides.",

As a result, it is often found in \"turns\" of peptides/proteins, as its free entropy (\u2206S) is not as comparatively large as other amino acids, and thus, in a folded form vs. unfolded form, the change in entropy is less. Furthermore, proline is rarely found in \u03b1 and \u03b2 structures, as it would reduce the stability of such structures, because its side chain \u03b1-N can only form one hydrogen bond.\n\nFurther, the hydroxylation of proline by prolyl hydroxylase and other additions of electron-withdrawing substituents, such as fluorine, increases the conformational stability of collagen significantly. Hence, the hydroxylation of proline is a critical biochemical process for maintaining the connective tissue of higher organisms. Polypeptide chains containing proline lack the flexibility of other peptides, because the proline ring has only one available angle for backbone rotation. Rotation occurs around the angles \u03c6, \u03c8 and \u03c9 [68,69].\n\nThe cyclization of linear peptide sequences can create constrained geometries that can alter the specificity of cyclic peptides to different isoforms or subtypes of targeted receptors.

By contrast, the cis and trans isomers of the X-Pro peptide bond (where X represents any amino acid) both experience steric clashes with the neighboring substitution and are nearly equal energetically. Hence, the fraction of X-Pro peptide bonds in the cis isomer under unstrained conditions ranges from 10% to 40%; the fraction depends slightly on the preceding amino acid, with aromatic residues favoring the cis isomer slightly. Proline cis-trans isomerization plays a key role in the rate-determining steps of protein folding [104]. Furthermore, proline cis-trans isomerization controls autoinhibition of a signaling protein [105]. Although the trans amide bond is more common, the occurrence of cis geometry is more frequent for the proline peptide bond than for other amino acids. The frequency of the cis proline peptide bond is higher in cyclic peptides than in linear peptides. As per a statistical study performed on the Cambridge Structural Database, 57.4% of proline residues present in cyclic peptides were in the cis conformation as compared to only 5.6% in acyclic peptides [106]. The reason for this high proportion of cis proline in cyclopeptides is due to the conformational restrictions during the cyclisation step. The geometry of the proline amide can be determined on the basis of the difference in 13 C chemical shifts between C\u03b2 and C\u03b3 signals (\u0394\u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 = \u03b4\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b3). A small 13 C chemical shift difference indicates that the proline peptide bond is trans, while a large 13 C chemical shift difference indicates a cis proline residue. The change in conformation of a cyclopolypeptide from \"trans\" to \"cis\" can result in loss of activity [10], e.g., the trans, trans-isomer of cyclic heptapeptide ceratospongamide showed potent inhibition of sPLA2 expression in a cell-based model for anti-inflammation, whereas the cis, cis-isomer was inactive ( Figure 5). The distribution of the peptide bond angle omega for peptidyl-prolyl bonds in proteins shows significant peaks at 180\u00b0 (trans peptide bond) and 0\u00b0 (cis peptide bond). Investigations on \"peptidyl-prolyl bonds and secondary structure\" showed that trans petidyl-prolyl bonds are distributed in all types of secondary structure,",

It is appreciated as a tecton for the rational design of new bio-active substances. Herein, we present a short overview of the subject. We analyzed 2366 proline-derived structures deposited in the Cambridge Structure Database, with emphasis on the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The latter are the first-line antihypertensive and cardiological drugs. Their side effects prompt a search for improved pharmaceuticals. Characterization of tectons (molecular building blocks) and the resulting supramolecular synthons (patterns of intermolecular interactions) involving proline derivatives, as presented in this study, may be useful for in silico molecular docking and macromolecular modeling studies. The DFT, Hirshfeld surface and energy framework methods gave considerable insight into the nature of close inter-contacts and supramolecular topology. Substituents of proline entity are important for the formation and cooperation of synthons. Tectonic subunits contain proline moieties characterized by diverse ionization states: -N and -COOH(-COO<sup-</sup), -N<sup+</sup and -COOH(-COO<sup-</sup), -NH and -COOH(-COO<sup-</sup), -NH<sup+</sup and -COOH(-COO<sup-</sup), and -NH<sub2</sub<sup+</sup and -COOH(-COO<sup-</sup). Furthermore, pharmacological profiles of ACE inhibitors and their impurities were determined via an in silico approach. The above data were used to develop comprehensive classification, which may be useful in further drug design studies.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple non-overlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on a modified version of the Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator. The results obtained, i.e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck.",

Synthesizability, stability and the sensibleness depend on the application area, are difficult to define, and can all appear subtle to non-chemists. For example, although we can encode a simple notion of syntactic correctness through valency constraints (for instance having maximally four substituents at a carbon atom), these do not guarantee that a molecule is semantically valid. Semantic validity is not trivial to define, and can be related to stability or the presence of undesirable substructures. For instance, a molecule consisting of a chain of 10 nitrogen atoms with alternating single and double bonds would satisfy valency constraints, but would unlikely be stable; it would decompose or explode immediately! We can view VS as being on one end of this tradeoff between chemical coverage and synthesizability/stability. By using pre-defined virtual libraries, we are limited in chemical coverage but can ensure that all the molecules included are sensible and synthesizable. This for instance is sometimes done by generating the library by iterating over a set of readily available starting materials, and combining them using virtual reaction schemes [14].\n\nInhabiting the other end of this tradeoff, would be a completely unconstrained de novo design algorithm, allowing any connecting bond between any atoms to construct the molecular graph. Although such an algorithm covers every conceivable molecule, it would generate structures not even meeting valency constraints. This can be remedied by the hand-coding of expert rules, e.g.\n\n[58]. However, arguably a more scalable approach was the development of algorithms that constructed molecules through combining together larger, sensible fragments [77] and later algorithms that constructed molecules iteratively by combining together building blocks via virtual reaction schemes [34,95]. However, even with these approaches there is still the problem of how best to search through this action space, a difficult discrete optimization problem, and so these algorithms often resorted to optimizing greedily one-step at a time or using genetic algorithms.",

These filters were hand-picked to exclude molecules with specific undesired properties, such as reactivity and chelation. IntDiv 1 and IntDiv 2 assess the internal diversity of the generated molecules and their values range between 0 and 1. A low score indicates that the generated molecules are limited in the variety of scaffolds and a high score corresponds to a higher inner diversity of the molecules. IntDiv 1 and IntDiv 2 can be calulated as follows\nIntDiv p (G) = 1 \u2212 p 1 |G| 2 m1,m2\u2208G T (m 1 , m 2 ) p ,\nwhere G stands for the set of molecules, T stands for Tanimoto distance, m 1 and m 2 stand for any pair of molecules in the set G and p \u2208 1, 2.\n\nAs can be seen from Table S1, aside from GrammarVae and MolCycleGAN the algorithms have shown they are able to produce a large portion of novel, never-seen-before molecules.

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesAs it is frequently the case that authentic samples of the natural product are unavailable to synthetic chemists for further analysis (more refined NMR techniques, derivatization experiments, etc), quantum chemical calculations of NMR properties emerge as a powerful and simple option to shed light on structural or stereochemical issues. 11The high accuracy provided by quantum chemically computed NMR shifts and coupling constants has been extensively employed in recent years to facilitate the determination of the tridimensional structure of a wide variety of organic molecules.Since the seminal reports of Bagno et al. 12 and Bifulco and co-workers, 12 the use of NMR calculations in structural organic chemistry have been widely spread.Extensive work by several research teams have been conducted to study different aspects of NMR calculations, 13 and excellent reviews were published covering the state of the art of this discipline. 11part from the choice of the level of theory to be employed in NMR calculation procedure, another critical aspect for structural elucidation purposes is the strategy to correlate the results of such calculations with the available experimental data, in order to manage the judgment action (for instance, decide the most likely structure of a given molecule).Naturally, all the different approaches share the same premise that the correct structure is expected to show a better match between experimental and simulated NMR data, but the differences between them arise on how such agreement is computed.For example, simple and easy-tocompute statistical parameters of correlation have been typically used to quantify the goodness of fit between different candidate structures.Among them, correlation coefficient (R 2 ) values, mean absolute error (MAE), corrected mean absolute error (CMAE) and maximum errors represent the most common parameters. 11More recently, new and sophisticated procedures to correlate experimental and calculated NMR data were introduced to increase the level of confidence and facilitate the structural assignment in different scenarios.For instance, the Goodman's CP3 parameter was thought to assign two sets of experimental NMR data to two plausible structures, 14 whereas the DP4 probability was created by the same group to determine the most likely structure when only one set of experimental NMR data is available. 15This last method, and the updated version DP4+ developed by the Sarotti and co-workers, 16 are among the most popular strategies to unravel the tridimensional structure of elusive molecules otherwise difficult to assign.The use of artificially-created neural networks to detect structural and/or stereochemical misassignments using pattern recognition analysis from",

We have an extensive collection of molecular transforms captured in the GSK BioDig system constructed using the algorithm of Hussain and Rea [37]. The input molecule is fragmented according to the fragmentation rules and BioDig is searched for relevant transforms. These transforms are then applied to the input molecule in a sequential fashion. For example a phenyl ring may be changed to a heterocycle or substituted with a methyl group. (B) BRICS. BRICS is a methodology developed to fragment molecules at defined chemically labile bonds [57]. This extends the well known RECAP approach [58,59] with some additional disconnections and has been implemented in RDkit [59]. As implemented in RDkit BRICS works by fragmenting molecules and then recombining the fragments in an iterative fashion. As the fragments are recombined randomly and only to a predefined depth the output molecules can bear little resemblance to the input molecules. For our use case we prefer to modify the input molecules in a systematic fashion. Thus the RDkit implementation has been extended in Python to provide additional methods that provide greater control over the generation phase, removing the random combinations in BRICS and imposing a sequence of recombination which ensures that application of the procedure will generate molecules with similar topology to the input (and has the reassuring feature that a fragmented input molecule will always regenerate the input molecule!). In a separate process the BRICS fragmentation has been applied to the GSK collection. The fragments are collected into a pool according to the atom labels that indicate possible recombinations with frequency and molecular properties (heavy atoms, molecular weight). The modified algorithm is used to generate structures by randomly or exhaustively replacing a particular fragment in the input molecule with fragments from the pool that share the same labels, so generating new molecules for further evaluation. The BRICS bond definitions are very specific for certain atom types, ring types and substitution patterns so options are given to allow some flexibility when recombining. For example, BRICS differentiates bonds to aromatic and aliphatic rings. An option has been added to remove this restriction when combining fragments thus allowing a phenyl to be replaced by cyclohexyl. Fragments can also be inserted (allowing for compound growth) or null fragments used to remove a fragment. (C) Similarity searching. Input molecules are searched against a number of internal and externally sourced datasets of available compounds, GSK collection, eMolecules [60], EnamineREAL [61]. Searches",

The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties.

In this Perspective, I present a personal account of my entree into bioorganic chemistry as a physical organic chemist and subsequent work to understand the chemical mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, to develop techniques to identify and assign hydrogen bonds in tRNAs through NMR studies with isotopically labeled molecules, and to study how structure determines function in biosynthetic enzymes with proteins obtained by genetic engineering.",

Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem-solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate, or as an electrophile; the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total synthesis.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

Typically, the term is used to describe the larger and characteristic parts of organic molecules, and it should not be used to describe or name smaller functional groups of atoms that chemically react in similar ways in most molecules that contain them. Occasionally, a moiety may contain smaller moieties and functional groups. A moiety that acts as a branch extending from the backbone of a hydrocarbon molecule is called a substituent or side chain, which typically can be removed from the molecule and substituted with others.

As well as providing insight into how molecules are formed in nature, the benefits of this approach to total synthesis are numerous and extend beyond the gains typical of traditional synthesis. For example, using biosynthetic proposals to design a synthetic route can highlight alternative methods to the desired target. The pursuit of biomimetic syntheses also promotes the development of new reactions to prove or disprove a biosynthetic proposal or to unravel mechanistic implications of a proposed biosynthesis and can lead to the identification of new natural products. Here we look at some recent compelling examples and examine how biomimetic synthesis has led to the discovery of new procedures and principles that would not have been found by other approaches.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Therefore, there is a need for novel methods for the design of peptide molecules with a particular specific physiochemical profile. The properties of the peptides are governed by the nature of amino acids constituting the peptide. There is a lack of a web server or tools which could predict all the possible combinations of the peptides generated because of the combinations of amino acids based on the physiochemical properties. We have developed a peptide combination generator (PepCoGen), a web server for generating all the possible combinations of peptides by varying the amino acids having similar physiochemical properties at a particular position. It also predicts other properties of the peptides including molecular weight, charge, solubility, hydrophobic plot, and isoelectric point, and random three-dimensional models for each generated combination.\n\n\u25a0 INTRODUCTION",

The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes. The area of membrane protein design, or more generally of biomimetic polymers that function in mixed or non-aqueous environments, is now becoming increasingly possible.",

Many of these new functions will require binding to small molecules. Is the ability to bind small molecules a property that arises only in response to biological selection or computational design? Or alternatively, is small molecule binding a property of folded proteins that occurs readily amidst collections of unevolved sequences? These questions can be addressed by assessing the binding potential of de novo proteins that are designed to fold into stable structures, but are \"na\u00efve\" in the sense that they (i) share no significant sequence similarity with natural proteins and (ii) were neither selected nor designed to bind small molecules. We chose three na\u00efve proteins from a library of sequences designed to fold into 4-helix bundles and screened for binding to 10,000 compounds displayed on small molecule microarrays. Several binders were identified, and binding was characterized by a series of biophysical assays. Surprisingly, despite the similarity of the three de novo proteins to one another, they exhibit selective ligand binding. These findings demonstrate the potential of novel proteins for molecular recognition and have significant implications for a range of applications in synthetic biology.",

To produce libraries containing an abundance of well-folded sequences, we have developed a method that incorporates both rational design and combinatorial diversity. Our method specifies the \"binary patterning\" of polar and nonpolar amino acids, but allows combinatorial diversity of amino acid side chains at each polar and nonpolar site in the sequence. Protein design by binary patterning is based on the premise that the appropriate arrangement of polar and nonpolar residues can direct a polypeptide chain to fold into amphipathic elements of secondary structures, which anneal together to form a desired tertiary structure. A designed binary pattern exploits the periodicities inherent in protein secondary structure, while allowing the identity of the side chain at each polar and non-polar position to be varied combinatorially. This chapter provides an overview of the considerations necessary to design binary patterned libraries of novel proteins.",

Among the main features supported by the library are methods for applying geometric transformations and alignments, the implementation of a rich set of energy functions, side chain optimization, backbone manipulation, calculation of solvent accessible surface area, and other tools. MSL has a number of unique features, such as the ability of storing alternative atomic coordinates (for modeling) and multiple amino acid identities at the same backbone position (for design). It has a straightforward mechanism for extending its energy functions and can work with any type of molecules. Although the code base is large, MSL was created with ease of developing in mind. It allows the rapid implementation of simple tasks while fully supporting the creation of complex applications. Some of the potentialities of the software are demonstrated here with examples that show how to program complex and essential modeling tasks with few lines of code. MSL is an ongoing and evolving project, with new features and improvements being introduced regularly, but it is mature and suitable for production and has been used in numerous protein modeling and design projects. MSL is open-source software, freely downloadable at http://msl-libraries.org.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

We highlight the potential of innovative computational tools in processing structurally complex natural products to predict their macromolecular targets and attempt to forecast the role that natural-product-derived fragments and fragment-like natural products will play in next-generation drug discovery.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

While the tenets of the field were originally implicitly founded on the use of chemistry to create those parts, its modern incarnation has focused on the use of parts assembled from natural components or components intended to mimic their natural counterparts. This would seem justified by the eons of evolution that optimized the natural components for functioning in a cell, at least for a similar function. However, most natural components are recognized by or interact with multiple other components in every cell, possibly in unknown ways, and thus their introduction may have unintended consequences. While truly synthetic parts made by chemists do not benefit from eons of evolution, they are foreign to cells, possibly even drawing upon forces not used by their natural counterparts, and thus they may be more orthogonal and possibly easier to introduce and optimize without perturbation. In this case, optimization must proceed with less information, because less is known about how the parts might interact with their biological targets, and the methodology and lessons of medicinal chemistry, which conceptually face essentially the same challenges, provide the blueprint for success. If the combination of synthetic and medicinal-like chemistry can produce molecules that function alongside those evolved by nature for the most central of its processes, to store and retrieve information, then this approach is likely to be capable of discovering molecules that effectively participate in any biological process, potentially opening a new vista for chemists in synthetic biology.   \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank former and current members of the Romesberg group, as well as those of our collaborators in the Dwyer and Marx groups for their contributions to the research highlighted in this Account.\n\n\u25a0 REFERENCES\n\nFigure 1 .\n1dNaM-dTPT3, dZ-dP, and dDs-dPx (R = H or \u2212CH(OH)\u2212CH 2 OH) UBPs.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2(A) First generation methylated benzene and naphthalene analogs.

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple non-overlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on a modified version of the Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator. The results obtained, i.e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck.",

In this Perspective, we explore how connecting Nature's small molecules to the genes that encode them has sparked a renaissance in natural product research, focusing primarily on the biosynthesis of polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. We survey monomer biogenesis, coupling chemistries from templated and non-templated pathways, and the broad set of tailoring reactions and hybrid pathways that give rise to the diverse scaffolds and functionalization patterns of natural products. We conclude by considering two questions: What would it take to find all natural product scaffolds? What kind of scientists will be studying natural products in the future?",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

Not all these sequences exhibit archetypical protein like behavior-folding rapidly and reproducibly under physiological conditions to their native state structures. 6 This is typically described in terms of two phases, the unfolded and folded, separated by a first-order transition, with the implicit meaning described above. Interestingly, protein structures are frequently tolerant to changes in amino acid sequence with mutations often causing only modest local changes in structure. 7 Remarkably, the total number of distinct protein native state folds is limited and only of the order of a few thousand. 8 This follows from the fact that native state folds are made of building blocks of tightly curled helices and strands assembled into almost planar sheet-like motifs. The number of distinct topologies in which these motifs can be assembled is limited. 9,10 The existence of these secondary motifs follows from two independent considerations: scaffolding provided by hydrogen bonds 11,12 ; and the steric requirement to avoid atomic overlaps. 13 Flory 1 wrote in 1969, Synthetic analogs of globular proteins are unknown. The capability of adopting a dense globular configuration stabilized by self-interactions and of transforming reversibly to the random coil is characteristics peculiar to the chain molecules of globular proteins alone. We note however that modern chemistry has made the engineering of synthetic analogs of globular proteins possible. The model proposed here provides a route for creating synthetic analogs of globular proteins and provides a bridge between polymer science and biomolecular science.\n\nWe begin with a standard classic homopolymer model. The linear chain comprises N main chain spheres of diameter \u03c3 in a railway train topology with, for simplicity, the distances between the centers of successive monomers set to be exactly b. To avoid spurious symmetries, we allow for the overlap of adjoining spheres (\u03c3 \u2265 b). Symmetry plays a key role in determining the phases of matter. For example, sensitive liquid crystal phases 14 form when a collection of spheres is replaced by a collection of anisotropic objects such as pencils or ellipsoids. The liquid crystal phase occurs at nonzero temperatures close to the liquid phase.",

Our goal is to engineer new naturally occurring folds with low homology to existing proteins. A selected protein is first partitioned into its building blocks based on their compactness, degree of isolation from the rest of the structure, and hydrophobicity. Next, the protein building blocks are substituted by fragments taken from other proteins with overall low sequence identity, but with a similar hydrophobic/hydrophilic pattern and a high structural similarity. These criteria ensure that the designed protein has a similar fold, low sequence identity, and a good hydrophobic core compared with its native counterpart. Here, we have selected two proteins for engineering, protein G B1 domain and ubiquitin. The two engineered proteins share approximately 20% and approximately 25% amino acid sequence identities with their native counterparts, respectively. The stabilities of the engineered proteins are tested by explicit water molecular dynamics simulations. The algorithm implements a strategy of designing a protein using relatively stable fragments, with a high population time. Here, we have selected the fragments by searching for local minima along the polypeptide chain using the protein building block model. Such an approach provides a new method for engineering new proteins with similar folds and low homology.",

The rational design of proteins from first-principles, or de novo, was once considered to be impossible, but today proteins with a variety of folds and functions have been realized. We review the evolution of the field from its earliest days, placing particular emphasis on how this endeavor has illuminated our understanding of the principles underlying the folding and function of natural proteins, and is informing the design of macromolecules with unprecedented structures and properties. An initial set of milestones in de novo protein design focused on the construction of sequences that folded in water and membranes to adopt folded conformations. The first proteins were designed from first-principles using very simple physical models. As computers became more powerful, the use of the rotamer approximation allowed one to discover amino acid sequences that stabilize the desired fold. As the crystallographic database of protein structures expanded in subsequent years, it became possible to construct proteins by assembling short backbone fragments that frequently recur in Nature. The second set of milestones in de novo design involves the discovery of complex functions. Proteins have been designed to bind a variety of metals, porphyrins, and other cofactors. The design of proteins that catalyze hydrolysis and oxygen-dependent reactions has progressed significantly. However, de novo design of catalysts for energetically demanding reactions, or even proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to highly functionalized complex polar molecules remains an importnant challenge that is now being achieved. Finally, the protein design contributed significantly to our understanding of membrane protein folding and transport of ions across membranes. The area of membrane protein design, or more generally of biomimetic polymers that function in mixed or non-aqueous environments, is now becoming increasingly possible.",

Randomly generated sequences, however, rarely fold into well-ordered proteinlike structures. To enhance the quality of a library, features of rational design must be used to focus sequence diversity into those regions of sequence space that are most likely to yield folded structures. This review describes how focused libraries can be constructed by designing the binary pattern of polar and nonpolar amino acids to favor proteins that contain abundant secondary structure, while simultaneously burying hydrophobic side chains and exposing hydrophilic side chains to solvent. The \"binary code\" for protein design was used to construct several libraries of de novo proteins, including both alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures. The recently determined solution structure of a binary patterned four-helix bundle is well ordered, thereby demonstrating that sequences that have neither been selected by evolution (in vivo or in vitro) nor designed by computer can form nativelike proteins. Examples are presented demonstrating how binary patterned libraries have successfully produced well-ordered structures, cofactor binding, catalytic activity, self-assembled monolayers, amyloid-like nanofibrils, and protein-based biomaterials.",

Many of these new functions will require binding to small molecules. Is the ability to bind small molecules a property that arises only in response to biological selection or computational design? Or alternatively, is small molecule binding a property of folded proteins that occurs readily amidst collections of unevolved sequences? These questions can be addressed by assessing the binding potential of de novo proteins that are designed to fold into stable structures, but are \"na\u00efve\" in the sense that they (i) share no significant sequence similarity with natural proteins and (ii) were neither selected nor designed to bind small molecules. We chose three na\u00efve proteins from a library of sequences designed to fold into 4-helix bundles and screened for binding to 10,000 compounds displayed on small molecule microarrays. Several binders were identified, and binding was characterized by a series of biophysical assays. Surprisingly, despite the similarity of the three de novo proteins to one another, they exhibit selective ligand binding. These findings demonstrate the potential of novel proteins for molecular recognition and have significant implications for a range of applications in synthetic biology.",

Random copolypeptides are typically prepared by simultaneous copolymerization of two or more different NCAs. The copolymerization step is clearly affected by different parameters including the type of initiator or the solvent employed. Nevertheless, once these parameters have been optimized, the knowledge of the relative reactivity of the different NCA monomers employed is crucial to determine the amino acid sequence distribution. Different techniques have been employed for this purpose including 1 H-, 15 N-, and 13 C-CP/MAS NMR techniques.\n\nFor instance, Wamsley et al. [95] reported the synthesis of different binary copolypeptides of \u03b2-benzyl aspartate-NCA (BLA), leucine-NCA (L-Leu) and valine-NCA (L-Val), i.e., combinations of L-Leu with BLA, BLA with L-Val, and L-Leu with L-Val were also prepared, parallel their reactivity ratios were obtained through three methods, i.e., Fineman-Ross, Kelen-T\u00fcdos graphical methods and the nonlinear least-squares curve fitting method. On the basis of these analyses, they found that the reactivity ratios varied as follows: \u03b2-benzyl aspartate-NCA > leucine-NCA > valine-NCA. Moreover, they explored also the fabrication of ternary copolymers. According to their findings, although the complexity increased from binary polymerizations to ternary polymerizations, the addition of a third NCA in the polymerization of poly(leucine-\u03b2-Bzl-aspartate-valine) did not adversely affect the randomness of the reaction, as determined from binary copolymerizations. The randomness of the terpolymer was confirmed because there was no difference between the terpolymer compositions determined experimentally and those predicted with the Alfrey-Goldfinger equations on the basis of the reactivity ratios obtained from binary copolymerizations.",

It is generally believed that the complex folded structures encountered in biology are the result of millions of years of evolution. Much of the research on synthetic foldamers 1\u221213 is driven by the desire to bypass evolution, go beyond the constraints of using only nature's building blocks, and directly access structures that fold like proteins, but are based on completely synthetic subunits. The ultimate goal is achieving new and sophisticated functions that require the molecular complexity of extended folded structures. This goal is still largely out of reach and foldamers able to exhibit specific function have remained rare, 14\u221216 due to the huge challenge of obtaining new modes of folding in designed proteins, 17,18 molecules that mimic peptides or nucleic acids, 5,8,9 and in completely abiotic molecules. 1\u22124,6,7,10\u221213 The approach taken to accessing new synthetic foldamers has until now relied almost exclusively on design, followed by multistep synthesis. An impressive new range of backbones have been developed that fold into a variety of well-defined architectures, including secondary structures such as helices and sheets. 19 Yet, the design approach tends to be based on relatively simple and small-range assembly motifs, primarily driven by interactions between residues close to each other in the oligomeric chain of monomer units. Foldamers that rely on long-range interactions (between residues further apart in the oligomeric chain, as observed in the folding of proteins and nucleic acids) have remained difficult to access due to a lack of reliable design rules. Hence, alternative approaches are needed for accessing fundamentally new classes of foldamers that rely on long-range interactions.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties.

Special Issue \"Feature Review Papers in Organic Synthesis\". Molecules 2022, 27, 825.\n\n\nOrganic synthesis allows scientists to construct and modify organic compounds using a continuously growing arsenal of reactions and methodologies. Consequently, new or improved procedures are reported daily for preparing a wide variety of valuable compounds belonging to the most different fields. This Special Issue of Molecules presents contributions reviewing modern synthetic procedures employed in several research areas.\n\nThe preparation of products suitable as starting materials for the synthesis of compounds of interest is always a critical point in organic synthesis. The contribution of Verochkina et al. illustrates this point [1], reviewing the synthesis of structurally \u03b1-functionalized \u03b1,\u03b2unsaturated aldehydes, an important class of compounds widely used in fine organic synthesis, biology, pharmacology, chemical industry, and agriculture.\n\nThe generation of heterocyclic systems is also an important topic in organic synthesis, as they appear in many biologically active compounds. Zhilitskaya et al. [2] present a representative review on this topic, which shows recent synthetic trends in the chemistry of biologically active 2-amino and 2-mercapto substituted benzothiazoles, from conventional multistep processes to one-pot, atom-economy procedures performed using green chemistry principles. In addition, the review of Zhang et al. [3] is another interesting example of heterocyclic chemistry, showing contributions in the design of N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) analogues. AHLs are small signalling molecules used by many Gram-negative bacteria, analogues and mimics of AHLs being biologically relevant targets.",

Synthesis of substituted N-(carboxyalkyl) amino-acid tert-butyl ester derivativesConfigurational assignment of the products\n\nThe natural L-amino-acids, except for those containing sulphur (cysteine and methionine), have S-configuration on the chiral centre. Thus the reaction ofan L-amino-acid tert-butyl ester with a 2-keto acid generally gives two diastereoisomers, [S,R]and [S,S]-isomers. All of the diastereoisomers derived from the 2-keto acids, except those from glyoxylic acid, pyruvic acid and 2-keto dicarboxylic acid, were separated from each other in the purification unit of the synthesis apparatus. Subsequently, the configurations of the newly formed chiral centres were determined. As a typical example, each diastereoisomer of 6 was derivatized into its N-(carboxy-3-methyl)-butyl-L-leucine disodium salt (7) having symmetrical structure. The first eluted peak (6-a) of 6, converted into the corresponding disodium salt (7-a) by deblocking with trifluoroacetic acid and purified on a Sephadex LH-20 column, gave the meso-compound having no [0]D value, whereas the disodium salt (7-b) derived from the second eluted peak (6-b) showed a positive [0]D value (+39-2). Thus the configuration of the newly formed chiral centre for 6-a was determined as R, and that of 6-b as S.  In the H NMR spectra of substituted N-(carboxyalkyl)amino-acid tert-butyl ester, the chemical shift of the tertbutyl ester group (1\"48-1-50 ppm) in the A-isomers was found to be generally at lower field (ca. 0\"01 ppm) than in the B-isomers. The chemical shifts of the methine protons on the two chiral centres of the A-isomers (around 2-9-3\"6 and 2-7-3\"2 ppm) were observed at higher field (0-05-0-1 ppm) than those of the B-isomers.\n\n\nTypical CD and [0]D of substituted N-(carboxyalkyl)-\n\n\nConclusion",

By using the methods described, 10-20 mg of 248 different 13-residue peptides representing single amino acid variants of a segment of the hemagglutinin protein (HA1) have been prepared and characterized in less than 4 weeks. Through examination of the binding of these analogs to monoclonal antibodies raised against residues 75-110 of HA1, it was found that a single amino acid, aspartic acid at position 101, is of unique importance to the interaction. Two other residues, aspartic acid-104 and alanine-106, were found to play a lesser but significant role in the binding interaction. Other single positional residue variations appear to be of little or no importance.",

The comparatively simple 124-amino acid structure of ribonuclease made it a logical target for the first enzyme to synthesize. Hirschmann's team built the enzyme in amino acid groups from six to 17 in length which were assembled into two large sections that were linked together, while Merrifield's approach was to assemble the entire enzyme by linking one amino acid at a time at the end of a chain. The achievement was front-page news in The New York Times, heralding the fact that \"An Enzyme Is Synthesized for First Time\" and providing coverage of a joint announcement by the two teams.

Nonlocal interactions are taken from structural database-derived statistical potentials, as in an earlier treatment. Local interactions are taken from simulations of (phi, psi) energy surfaces for each amino acid generated using the Biosym Discover program. Conformational searching is done by a genetic algorithm-based method. Reasonable structures are obtained for melittin (a 26-mer), avian pancreatic polypeptide inhibitor (a 36-mer), crambin (a 46-mer), apamin (an 18-mer), tachyplesin (a 17-mer), C-peptide of ribonuclease A (a 13-mer), and four different designed helical peptides. A hydrogen bond interaction was tested and found to be generally unnecessary for helical peptides, but it helps fold some sheet regions in these structures.

Twenty amino acids are commonly found in proteins, and all except glycine have stereochemistry similar to that of L sugars. In neutral solution, amino acids exist as dipolar zwitterions.\n\nAmino acids can be synthesized in racemic form by several methods, including ammonolysis of an $\\alpha$-bromo acid, alkylation of diethyl acetamidomalonate, and reductive amination of an $\\alpha$-keto acid. Alternatively, an enantioselective synthesis of amino acids can be carried out using a chiral hydrogenation catalyst.\n\nDetermining the structure of a peptide or protein begins with amino acid analysis. The peptide is hydrolyzed to its constituent $\\alpha$-amino acids, which are separated and identified. Next, the peptide is sequenced. Edman degradation by treatment with phenyl isothiocyanate (PITC) cleaves one residue from the N terminus of the peptide and forms an easily identifiable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative of the $\\mathbf{N}$-terminal amino acid. An automated series of Edman degradations can sequence peptide chains up to 50 residues in length.\n\nPeptide synthesis involves the use of protecting groups. An N-protected amino acid with a free $-\\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\mathrm{H}$ group is coupled using DCC or EDC to an O-protected amino acid with a free $-\\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ group. Amide formation occurs, the protecting groups are removed, and the sequence is repeated. Amines are usually protected as their tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) or fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) derivatives; acids are usually protected as esters. The synthesis is often carried out by the Merrifield solid-phase method, in which the peptide is bonded to insoluble polymer beads.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself.

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

It usually refers to a process not involving the aid of biological processes, which distinguishes it from semisynthesis. Syntheses may sometimes conclude at a precursor with further known synthetic pathways to a target molecule, in which case it is known as a formal synthesis. Total synthesis target molecules can be natural products, medicinally-important active ingredients, known intermediates, or molecules of theoretical interest. Total synthesis targets can also be organometallic or inorganic, though these are rarely encountered.

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

These binding site definitions yield thousands of RosettaMatch solutions that agree well with originally defined geometries. We also introduce a new design method that recapitulates key interactions in ligand binding sites. Moreover, we show that the new design method improves several metrics in design that are predictive of success when designs are experimentally characterized. While we have incorporated these new methods in Rosetta, the principles are generally applicable to other design approaches.

The tree search is guided by an artificial neural network policy that suggests possible precursors by utilizing a library of known reaction templates. The software is fast and can typically find a solution in less than 10\u00a0s and perform a complete search in less than 1\u00a0min. Moreover, the development of the code was guided by a range of software engineering principles such as automatic testing, system design and continuous integration leading to robust software with high maintainability. Finally, the software is well documented to make it suitable for beginners. The software is available at http://www.github.com/MolecularAI/aizynthfinder .",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

Proven strategies include diverted total synthesis (DTS), function-oriented synthesis (FOS), biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), complexity to diversity (CtD), hybrid molecules, and biosynthesis inspired synthesis. The latter includes mutasynthesis, the synthesis of natural products encoded by silent genes, and propionate scanning. Most of the examples from our group fall in the quite general concept of DTS. Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis. However, even for compounds of moderate complexity, organic synthesis remains a bottle neck. Unless some method for predicting the biological activity of a designed molecule becomes available, the design and synthesis of natural product analogues will remain what it is now, namely it will largely rely on trial and error.

With the avalanche of bioinformatics data, de novo design is ideally suited for exploring molecules that could be useful for chemical genomics. The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

The first method is identification of new ligands for a given receptor by searching large databases of 3D structures of small molecules to find those fitting the binding pocket of the receptor using fast approximate docking programs. This method is known as virtual screening. A second category is de novo design of new ligands. In this method, ligand molecules are built up within the constraints of the binding pocket by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either individual atoms or molecular fragments. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures, not contained in any database, can be suggested. A third method is the optimization of known ligands by evaluating proposed analogs within the binding cavity. Binding site identification",

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesIn 2006, La Clair 64 reported the first total synthesis of the originally proposed structure of hexacyclinol (134), claiming excellent agreement between the NMR data of synthetic sample and the natural product.The 37-step synthesis (not discussed in this review) involved several challenging steps, and allowed to obtain 3.6 g of the natural product.Such impressive results, coupled with the doubtful stability of the endo-peroxide present in 134, generated some skepticism among the scientific community.A few months after La Clair's publication, Scott Rychnovsky 65 challenged the structure of hexacyclinol by computational means in a seminal work on the use of quantum calculations of NMR shifts in structural elucidation.The NMR shifts of the originally proposed structure was carried out at the mPW1PW91/6-31G**//HF/3-21G level of theory (previously validated with related known compounds) and a significantly poor match between experimental and calculated values was noticed, with several carbons showing errors higher than 10 ppm.Such poor correlation suggested that the proposed structure was in error, though the real identity of hexacyclinol had to be solved.To make progress in this regard, Rychnovsky 65 became interested in panepophenanthrin (135), isolated in 2002 from a different strain of Panus rudis, 66 and synthesized by several research groups. 67Despite the ring systems of 134 and 135 bear no relationship, both display similar functional groups, molecular weights and biological source.Since hexacyclinol was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with methanol, Rychnovsky 65 envisioned that 188 might be an isolation artifact from the acid-promoted decomposition of panepophenanthrin (135), as shown in Scheme 16.In addition, the NMR calculations carried out with structure 138 showed very nice agreement with the experimental NMR data of the natural product, strengthening Rychnovsky's proposal. 65n the meantime, Rychnovsky teamed up with Porco and co-workers (which had previously synthesized panepophenanthrin), 67 to experimentally prove this structural hypothesis. 68Unfortunately, treatment of synthetic 135 under a variety of acidic conditions did not lead to any observable conversion towards 138, suggesting that the hemiacetal structure of 135 might lock the dimeric framework, preventing further ring opening events.Hence, the authors revised their synthetic route",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesNobilisitine A was isolated in 1999 by Evidente et al. 43 from the crude CHCl 3 extract of Clivia nobilis, an ornamental plant cultivated in Egypt.Whereas its planar structure was determined from standard 1D and 2D NMR experiments, the relative configuration proposal relied mainly on the observed coupling constants.In particular, the 3 J 4a-5 = 9.9 Hz, 3 J 4b-5 = 5.0 Hz and 3 J 5-5a = 6.6 Hz values were interpreted on the basis of an axial and equatorial orientation of H-5 and H-5a, respectively.Next, from the coupling constant between H-5a and H-11b ( 3 J 4a-5 = 5.0 Hz) the authors suggested that H-11b should be axial, corresponding to a cis B/C ring fusion.Furthermore, H-11c was proposed to have an equatorial orientation from its coupling with H-11b ( 3 J 11b-11c = 5.0 Hz).Finally, the cis C/D fusion was proposed considering that H-3a should be axial ( 3 J 3a-11c = 5.8 Hz).However, the originally proposed structure of nobilisitine A (61, Figure 15) was found incorrect by Cade and co-workers 44 after completing the first total synthesis of ent-61 (verified by X-ray) showing significant deviations in the NMR data with those of the natural product.After thorough comparison of the spectroscopic data of synthetic sample and the natural product, the authors hypothesized that the source of the problem was stereochemical.Under this assumption, Lodewyk and Tantillo 45 performed a comprehensive computational study to elucidate the most likely structure of nobilisitine A. In order to narrow down the number of diastereoisomers (up to 16), the authors assumed that the cis C/D ring fusion might not have been misassigned, leading to 8 candidate structures.Next, they computed the NMR shifts at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31+G** level of theory, previously validated in the same work with known analogues.The best match between experimental and calculated",

In this review, three new developments in rational drug design are explored. These developments include new methods to find binding sites for small molecules on the surface of a protein, the suggestion that the protein environment may change the shape of a protein sufficiently to alter drug design, and the use of data emerging from structural genomics in drug design. Although these are three new and distinct areas, the insights derived from these studies suggest a reason for the observation that similar drugs do not always bind to a protein in the same manner.",

In the quest to discover drugs that modulate the function of these targets, identification of small-molecule drug leads is one of the earliest steps. Structure-based drug design has emerged as a valuable, inexpensive, and rapid computational resource that identifies lead compounds that are complementary to the structure of the target. Leads identified through this process are biologically evaluated and \"hit compounds\" with affinity and activity are further optimized. This chapter introduces the process of structure-based drug design, including preparation of the ligand database, preparation of the target structure, docking and scoring, and evaluation.",

Today we understand the activity of drugs and reagents first through the specific, clonable receptor molecules with which they interact. To understand biological mechanism we begin with a specific molecular receptor, and to discover new leads for pharmacological intervention, we screen a library of compounds against a particular isolated target. Even when we screen for a phenotype against a cell or organism we subsequently seek to isolate the receptor responsible for that phenotype. Two targets are similar when their sequences and structures are similar, and when we think about side effects our first thoughts are of those proteins that are most related by sequence and structure to the particular targets in which we are interested.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Ligand-based Ligand-based drug design (or indirect drug design) relies on knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules may be used to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn may be used to design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived. These QSAR relationships in turn may be used to predict the activity of new analogs.",

In its most common form, it involves modification of a known active scaffold or linking known active scaffolds, although de novo drug design (i.e., from scratch) is also possible. Though highly interrelated, identification of active scaffolds should be conceptually separated from drug design. Traditionally, the drug design process has focused on the molecular determinants of the interactions between the drug and its known or intended molecular target. Nevertheless, current drug design also takes into consideration other relevant processes than influence drug efficacy and safety (e.g., bioavailability, metabolic stability, interaction with antitargets).This chapter provides an overview on possible approaches to identify active scaffolds (including in silico approximations to approach that task) and computational methods to guide the subsequent optimization process. It also discusses in which situations each of the overviewed techniques is more appropriate.",

Herein, the authors provide new insights into the importance of molecular topology according to some of the latest discoveries in physics and chemistry. Furthermore, the authors report on the most significant achievements in drug design using molecular topology over the last 5\u00a0years and give their expert perspectives on the subject as a whole. Molecular topology is a new paradigm which is independent of physicochemical molecular descriptors. This fact explains the viability of both the discovery of new lead compounds with a minimum of information derived from mathematical-topological patterns and the interpretation results in structural and physicochemical terms.",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Virtual molecules assembled from existing starting material connected by these reactions are supposed to have an enhanced chance to be amenable to real chemical synthesis. About 50% of the reactions in the dataset are ring-forming reactions, which fosters the assembly of novel ring systems and innovative chemotypes. A comparison with a recent survey of the reactions used in early drug discovery revealed considerable overlaps with the collection presented here.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

As such, the makeup of screening libraries largely dictates the biological targets that can be modulated and the therapeutics that can be developed. Unfortunately, most compound-screening collections consist principally of planar molecules with little structural or stereochemical complexity, compounds that do not offer the arrangement of chemical functionality necessary for the modulation of many drug targets. Here we describe a novel, general and facile strategy for the creation of diverse compounds with high structural and stereochemical complexity using readily available natural products as synthetic starting points. We show through the evaluation of chemical properties (which include fraction of sp(3) carbons, ClogP and the number of stereogenic centres) that these compounds are significantly more complex and diverse than those in standard screening collections, and we give guidelines for the application of this strategy to any suitable natural product.",

The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug.

With the avalanche of bioinformatics data, de novo design is ideally suited for exploring molecules that could be useful for chemical genomics. The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

This representation is quite flexible since it can also incorporate information about the binding position in an active site of a protein[64,65]. One major challenge of this representation is sparsity; for this purpose, Kuzminykh et al.[66] proposed an invertible smoothing transformation to reduce sparsity in the 3D space. Building generative models on 3D representations remains an open problem. One of the current approaches that allows to work directly in the 3D space is providing 3D coordinates to graph nodes or SMILES atoms.4 MetricsGenerative models are supposed to produce a wide variety of different samples. Therefore, to evaluate generative models one has to compare sets of generated molecules, looking for coverage of the ground truth, diversity among generated objects, and similarity between various statistical properties of the generated set and the reference set. To this purpose, we have utilized five metrics that can be used to compare a generated set of molecules G and a reference set of molecules R: fragment similarity, scaffold similarity, nearest neighbor similarity (based on Morgan structural fingerprints and Gobby",

We modified the graph canonizer Nauty [23,29] in order to allow multigraphs and not only simple graphs. Other canonizers for graphs exist like MOLGEN-CID [30] or the Signature Canonizer [31], but Nauty has been the most widely used for graphs as well as for chemistry problems, like InChI [32] codes. Nauty is the canonizer of choice because it is the fastest of all available canonizers for bounded valence graphs below 100 vertices [33] (molecules are examples of this class of graphs). Firstly, the function canonize translates the molecule into a colored multigraph. Secondly, it utilizes Nauty to calculate the canonical labeling of the multigraph. Thirdly, this canonical labeling is used to construct the canonical version of the input molecule. Lastly, the canonical hash string of each augmented molecule is stored in a hash map, lines 16 and 17, in order to remove duplicated extensions at each level of the tree. Each unique extension is checked for canonical augmentation, line 18, using Algorithm 2, or Algorithm 3 in case prescribed substructures were provided. If this extension is successful, the function generate is called, line 19 of Algorithm 1, and the molecule we want to continue extending is passed as a parameter. When a molecule cannot be extended any further, the recursion is terminated and the program backtracks in the search tree.\n\n\nInput and output\n\nThe minimum input required is the elemental composition of the structures that have to be generated.

Since OMG does not take hydrogen atoms into account during the generation of intermediate chemical structures, the hydrogen atoms present in the substructures will be removed before the generation process begins. These substructures should be non-overlapping, i.e. they should not share any atoms. This limitation is due to the fact that our algorithm grows molecules by adding bonds and, if two atoms in different fragments were in fact the same atom, our algorithm would create bonds between those atoms, which would clearly lead to incorrect results.",

In particular, polynuclear transition-metal complexes and clusters can be considered. Structural information is encoded as a graph. Stereocenter configurations are interpretable from Cartesian coordinates into an abstract index of permutation for an extensible set of polyhedral shapes. Substituents are distinguished through a ranking algorithm. Graph and stereocenter representations are freely modifiable, and the chiral state is propagated where possible through incurred ranking changes. Conformers are generated with full stereoisomer control by four spatial dimension Distance Geometry with a refinement error function including dihedral terms. Molecules are comparable by an extended graph isomorphism, and their representation is canonicalizeable. Molassembler is written in C++ and provides Python bindings.",

An ideal molecular representation should be unique, invariant with respect to different symmetry operations, invertible, efficient to obtain, and capture the physics, stereo chemistry, and structural motif. Some of these can be achieved by using the physical, chemical, and structural properties [34], which, all together, are rarely well documented so obtaining this information is considered cumbersome task. Over time, this has been tackled by using several alternative approaches that work well for specific problems [35][36][37][38][39][40] as shown in Figure 2. However, developing universal representations of molecules for diverse ML problems is still a challenging task, and any gold standard method that works consistently for all kind of problems is yet to be discovered. Molecular representations primarily used in the literature falls into two broad categories: (a) 1D and/or 2D representations designed by experts using domain specific knowledge, including properties from the simulation and experiments, and (b) iteratively learned molecular representations directly from the 3D nuclear coordinates/properties within ML frameworks.",

Its versatility is illustrated by the correct generation of molecules containing third-row elements and a surprisingly adept handling of complex boron chemistry.

The valence, to which we will also refer as degree, of these chemical elements determine how many bonds each element can have. Carbon has a valence of 4, oxygen of 2, nitrogen of 3 or 5, sulfur of 2,4 or 6, phosphor of 3 or 5. Thus a carbon atom becomes saturated when it has 4 bonds, where a single bond counts as one bond, a double as two bonds, and a triple as three bonds. Regarding molecules, we consider a molecule to be saturated when all its atoms are saturated. In some special occasions, atoms are charged, which makes them having a different valence. In the case of OMG, we only use neutral atoms and as a consequence only neutral molecules are produced, therefore all finished molecules will contain atoms with the valences mentioned before.\n\nA chemical element can have multiple atom types, also for the same valence of an element, as defined by the dictionary of atom types in CDK. This dictionary defines for each atom the number of neighbors, pi bonds, charges, lone electron pairs, and hybridizations, in order to accommodate the different states a chemical element can have due to different bonds, number of neighboring atoms, charges and hybridizations. These atom types are based on the chemical elements that have been observed in nature for saturated molecules. This is why we use the CDK atom dictionary to validate the atoms of our finished molecules.\n\nOMG will output only molecules that are saturated and that contain the atoms specified in the elemental composition. Apart from finished molecules, OMG has to represent during the generation process intermediate chemical structures that are not finished yet. These might contain disconnected fragments and atoms that are not saturated. CDK atom types are not designed to represent atom types of unsaturated chemical elements; therefore we opted for implementing a simple atom dictionary. For each chemical element, this dictionary defines its valence, in other words, the maximum degree. Hence for intermediate chemical structures we only check that the current degree of each atom does not exceed the maximum degree.",

Like COCOA, the initial state of the problem is a hyper structure. Both assembly and reduction methods have advantages and disadvantages, and the GEN tool avoids these disadvantages in the generation step. In other words, structure reduction is efficient when structural constraints are provided, and structure assembly is faster without constraints. First, the useless connections are eliminated, and then the substructures are assembled to build structures. Thus, GEN copes with the constraints in a more efficient way by combining these methods. GEN removes the connections creating the forbidden structures, and then the connection matrices are filled based on substructure information. The method does not accept overlaps among substructures. Once the structure is built in the matrix representation, the saturated molecule is stored in the output list. The COCOA method was further",

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

In its most common form, it involves modification of a known active scaffold or linking known active scaffolds, although de novo drug design (i.e., from scratch) is also possible. Though highly interrelated, identification of active scaffolds should be conceptually separated from drug design. Traditionally, the drug design process has focused on the molecular determinants of the interactions between the drug and its known or intended molecular target. Nevertheless, current drug design also takes into consideration other relevant processes than influence drug efficacy and safety (e.g., bioavailability, metabolic stability, interaction with antitargets).This chapter provides an overview on possible approaches to identify active scaffolds (including in silico approximations to approach that task) and computational methods to guide the subsequent optimization process. It also discusses in which situations each of the overviewed techniques is more appropriate.",

These other molecules may be used to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based on the knowledge of what binds to it, and this model in turn may be used to design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived.

The discovery was published Nature in 1959). This paved the way for new and improved drugs as all semi-synthetic penicillins are produced from chemical manipulation of 6-APA. The second-generation semi-synthetic \u03b2-lactam antibiotic methicillin, designed to counter first-generation-resistant penicillinases, was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1959.

Preliminary results of the antibacterial activity of some of these 4-alkyliden-b-lactams have disclosed the opportunity for the application of molecular modeling to relate chemical structures to antibiotic activity and to point out structural modifications that might increase antibiotic potency. Despite significant advances in the elucidation of the structures of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), the overall structural basis for multidrug bacterial resistance has not been clarified. PBPs are a heterogeneous family of enzymes with transpeptidase and transcarboxylase activities involved in the synthesis and crosslinking of the peptidoglycan component of bacterial cell walls, which is fundamental for the maintenance of bacterial cell morphology and integrity. On the basis of these considerations, the authors adopted a molecular modeling approach to identify attractive drug candidates and to contribute to the rationalization of functional group effects on the SARs. Thus, a series of b-lactams have been synthesized such as compounds of Fig. 34, that exhibited an inhibitory effect, generally more marked against Gram positive pathogens, although the spectrum of activity varied.\n\nInterestingly, the undifferentiated antibacterial activity against both methicillinsusceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was suggestive of an alternative mechanism of action compared to that of typical b-lactams. The molecular modeling approach allowed the identification of interactions through oxygenated functions such as phenolic OH, which are valuable for the antibacterial activity [294].",

Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) are membrane-associated proteins that catalyze the final step of murein biosynthesis in bacteria [9]. These proteins function as either transpeptidases or carboxypeptidases and in a few cases demonstrate transglycosylase activity [10]. Both transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities of PBPs occur at the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of a murein precursor containing a disaccharide pentapeptide comprising N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetyl-muramic acid-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala. The Penicillins antibiotics inhibit these enzymes by competing with the pentapeptide precursor for binding to the active site of the enzyme [11]. Penicillins bind irreversibly to the active site of theses enzyme and thus prevents the final cross-linking of the peptidoglycan layer which disrupts the cell wall synthesis.\n\n6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) is an important industrial intermediate produced on large scale by the enzymatic cleavage of penicillin G (V) side-chain with penicillin amidase in solution or with immobilized enzyme. Most of the penicillins are produced by coupling 6-APA with the required side chain [12] except of Penicillin G and Penicillin V, which can be industrially produced by fermentation from high producing strains of Penicillium chrysogenum.",

In the enzyme inhibitory assay the compound 4e inhibited E. coli MurC with an IC50 value of 12.5 \u03bcM. The docking scores of these compounds 4c and 4e also verified their greater antibacterial potential. The results verified the importance of side chain functionalities along with the presence of central penam nucleus. The binding affinities calculated from docking results expressed in the form of binding energies ranges from -7.8 to -9.2kcal/mol. The carboxylic group of penam nucleus in all these compounds is responsible for strong binding with receptor protein with the bond length ranges from 3.4 to 4.4 \u01fa.

Pathogenic bacteria have evolved efficient antibiotic resistance mechanisms that, in Gram-positive bacteria, include mutations to PBPs that enable them to avoid beta-lactam inhibition. Lactivicin (LTV; 1) contains separate cycloserine and gamma-lactone rings and is the only known natural PBP inhibitor that does not contain a beta-lactam. Here we show that LTV and a more potent analog, phenoxyacetyl-LTV (PLTV; 2), are active against clinically isolated, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. Crystallographic analyses of S. pneumoniae PBP1b reveal that LTV and PLTV inhibition involves opening of both monocyclic cycloserine and gamma-lactone rings. In PBP1b complexes, the ring-derived atoms from LTV and PLTV show a notable structural convergence with those derived from a complexed cephalosporin (cefotaxime; 3). The structures imply that derivatives of LTV will be useful in the search for new antibiotics with activity against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.",

For example, the first chemically altered penicillin, methicillin, had substitutions by methoxy groups at positions 2\u2019 and 6\u2019 of the 6-APA benzene ring from penicillin G. This difference makes methicillin resistant to the activity of \u03b2-lactamase, an enzyme by which many bacteria are naturally unsusceptible to penicillins. Pharmacology Entry into bacteria Penicillin can easily enter bacterial cell in case of Gram-positive species. This is because Gram-positive bacteria do not have an outer cell membrane and are simply enclosed in a thick cell wall. Penicillin molecules are small enough to pass through the spaces of glycoproteins in the cell wall. For this reason Gram-positive bacteria are very susceptible to penicillin (as first evidenced by the discovery of penicillin in 1928).",

In addition to a plethora of natural flavonoids, the construction of flavonoid skeletons still situates at the convergence point in the medicinal chemistry. Not surprisingly, amplification in the organic synthetic protocols showcases an expected avenue for accessing to abundant flavonoid scaffolds with special pharmacological activities. Hence, it is necessary to address the recent progresses in the synthesis of flavonoids by using organic strategies, and some typical protocols on the construction of flavonoids are thereby collected from recent publications (from 2020). The synthetic strategies presented herein are mainly cataloged as the cyclization of 4-chromanone, the glycosylation on the flavonoid scaffold, and the application of flavonoids in the pharmacological researches, aiming at providing with a current picture for depicting the recent progress on the synthesis of flavonoids. Therefore, it is expected to be a reference for the further exploration on the designing of synthetic routines for flavonoids.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

As such they can be regarded as non-biogenic fusions of NP-derived fragments. They inherit key biological characteristics of the guiding natural product, such as chemical and physiological properties, yet define small molecule chemotypes with unprecedented or unexpected bioactivity. We iterate the design principles underpinning PNP scaffolds and highlight their syntheses and biological investigations. We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity. We propose and discuss how the iterative analysis of NP structure, design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of PNPs can be regarded as a human-driven branch of the evolution of natural products, that is, a chemical evolution of natural product structure.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple non-overlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on a modified version of the Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator. The results obtained, i.e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck.",

Both generators take resonance into account producing all the contributing structures. As a result, the two resonant forms of benzene will be considered as different molecules. Both OMG and MOLGEN are not limited to acyclic structures [35,36],thus the two structure generators tested can generate molecules with rings. Furthermore, both tools generate molecules containing common chemical elements present in metabolites, like C, O, N, H, P, and S, and are not limited to only 4 chemical elements [36]. Both structure generators generate molecules for a given elemental composition by exhaustively producing all non-redundant chemical structures.\n\nThe number of molecules produced after using the elemental compositions of a diverse selection of metabolites containing only C, O and H, is presented in Table 2. For all these metabolites, the same number of molecules is generated by both generators. While both generators produce complete results, MOLGEN does it in less time. The time between initialization and finalization was measured using time functions in JAVA for OMG and equivalent functions in python for MOLGEN. We can observe in Table 2 the time in seconds to generate all the candidate structures and the time to generate each molecule in milliseconds. If we look at time per molecule, MOLGEN is 4 times faster than OMG for small molecules like pyruvic acid. For larger molecules MOLGEN obtains a constant time per molecule between 0.008 and 0.009 milliseconds, while OMG ranges from 18 to 45 milliseconds depending on the elemental composition. Lightweight profiling of OMG was performed using VisualVM (version 1.3.4), in order to have an understanding of the limiting points in the performance of OMG. The most relevant finding was that the canonization process, which uses Nauty, took half of the total running time.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesAs it is frequently the case that authentic samples of the natural product are unavailable to synthetic chemists for further analysis (more refined NMR techniques, derivatization experiments, etc), quantum chemical calculations of NMR properties emerge as a powerful and simple option to shed light on structural or stereochemical issues. 11The high accuracy provided by quantum chemically computed NMR shifts and coupling constants has been extensively employed in recent years to facilitate the determination of the tridimensional structure of a wide variety of organic molecules.Since the seminal reports of Bagno et al. 12 and Bifulco and co-workers, 12 the use of NMR calculations in structural organic chemistry have been widely spread.Extensive work by several research teams have been conducted to study different aspects of NMR calculations, 13 and excellent reviews were published covering the state of the art of this discipline. 11part from the choice of the level of theory to be employed in NMR calculation procedure, another critical aspect for structural elucidation purposes is the strategy to correlate the results of such calculations with the available experimental data, in order to manage the judgment action (for instance, decide the most likely structure of a given molecule).Naturally, all the different approaches share the same premise that the correct structure is expected to show a better match between experimental and simulated NMR data, but the differences between them arise on how such agreement is computed.For example, simple and easy-tocompute statistical parameters of correlation have been typically used to quantify the goodness of fit between different candidate structures.Among them, correlation coefficient (R 2 ) values, mean absolute error (MAE), corrected mean absolute error (CMAE) and maximum errors represent the most common parameters. 11More recently, new and sophisticated procedures to correlate experimental and calculated NMR data were introduced to increase the level of confidence and facilitate the structural assignment in different scenarios.For instance, the Goodman's CP3 parameter was thought to assign two sets of experimental NMR data to two plausible structures, 14 whereas the DP4 probability was created by the same group to determine the most likely structure when only one set of experimental NMR data is available. 15This last method, and the updated version DP4+ developed by the Sarotti and co-workers, 16 are among the most popular strategies to unravel the tridimensional structure of elusive molecules otherwise difficult to assign.The use of artificially-created neural networks to detect structural and/or stereochemical misassignments using pattern recognition analysis from",

The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

This approach seeks to identify the structural unit or pharmacophore responsible for the desired activity. Such pharmacophores have been the start point for a wide range of lead generation and optimisation programmes using techniques such as Biology Oriented Synthesis, Diversity Oriented Synthesis, Diverted Total Synthesis, and Fragment Based Drug Discovery.

The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software. The computational approach proved to be suitable for scaffold-hopping from known ligands to novel chemotypes, and for generating bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.",

Recent Examples and Future PerspectivesIt is well known that total synthesis of natural products is a complex field, often fraught with difficulties and detours. 10Hence, if there is sufficient cause to suspect that a structural misassignment has occurred, having additional certainty on the target structure to be synthesized in the first place would significantly reduce time, money and manpower required to succeed.A similar situation occurs when the originally proposed structure of a natural product is found incorrect by a previous synthetic work (but the real structure remains unknown), or when the isolation team actually recognizes the impossibility to irrefutably determine the structure at certain part of the molecule.",

If there exists a bond between a pair of atoms function extend, in line 12 of Algorithm 1, will increase the multiplicity.

The software DOGS (Design of Genuine Structures) features a ligand-based strategy for automated 'in silico' assembly of potentially novel bioactive compounds. The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software. The computational approach proved to be suitable for scaffold-hopping from known ligands to novel chemotypes, and for generating bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.",

We provide a cheminformatic analysis of PNP collections assessing their molecular properties and shape diversity.

With the chemical compounds retained, neutralized, and reionized, a canonical tautomer was generated.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Proven strategies include diverted total synthesis (DTS), function-oriented synthesis (FOS), biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), complexity to diversity (CtD), hybrid molecules, and biosynthesis inspired synthesis. The latter includes mutasynthesis, the synthesis of natural products encoded by silent genes, and propionate scanning. Most of the examples from our group fall in the quite general concept of DTS. Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis. However, even for compounds of moderate complexity, organic synthesis remains a bottle neck. Unless some method for predicting the biological activity of a designed molecule becomes available, the design and synthesis of natural product analogues will remain what it is now, namely it will largely rely on trial and error.

Although many organic molecules can occur in \"right-handed\" and \"left-handed\" forms, invariably just one of these is seen in living organisms. Normal chemical reactions, however, make both forms in equal amounts.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

In the quest to discover drugs that modulate the function of these targets, identification of small-molecule drug leads is one of the earliest steps. Structure-based drug design has emerged as a valuable, inexpensive, and rapid computational resource that identifies lead compounds that are complementary to the structure of the target. Leads identified through this process are biologically evaluated and \"hit compounds\" with affinity and activity are further optimized. This chapter introduces the process of structure-based drug design, including preparation of the ligand database, preparation of the target structure, docking and scoring, and evaluation.",

This method is known as virtual screening. A second category is de novo design of new ligands. In this method, ligand molecules are built up within the constraints of the binding pocket by assembling small pieces in a stepwise manner. These pieces can be either individual atoms or molecular fragments. The key advantage of such a method is that novel structures, not contained in any database, can be suggested. A third method is the optimization of known ligands by evaluating proposed analogs within the binding cavity. Binding site identification",

In its most common form, it involves modification of a known active scaffold or linking known active scaffolds, although de novo drug design (i.e., from scratch) is also possible. Though highly interrelated, identification of active scaffolds should be conceptually separated from drug design. Traditionally, the drug design process has focused on the molecular determinants of the interactions between the drug and its known or intended molecular target. Nevertheless, current drug design also takes into consideration other relevant processes than influence drug efficacy and safety (e.g., bioavailability, metabolic stability, interaction with antitargets).This chapter provides an overview on possible approaches to identify active scaffolds (including in silico approximations to approach that task) and computational methods to guide the subsequent optimization process. It also discusses in which situations each of the overviewed techniques is more appropriate.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

During one such early expedition on the synthesis of porphyrin, Woodward proposed that condensing pyrrole with an aldehyde under acidic conditions yields the \"precursor\" porphyrinogen macrocycle. Its four-electron oxidation leads to the \"transitory\" 20\u03c0 isophlorin, which undergoes subsequent two-electron oxidation to form the 18\u03c0 \"porphyrin\". Due to its fleeting lifetime, it has been a synthetic challenge to stabilize the tetrapyrrolic isophlorin. This macrocycle symbolizes the antiaromatic character of a porphyrin-like macrocycle. In addition, the pyrrole NH also plays a key role in the proton-coupled, two-electron oxidation of isophlorin to the aromatic porphyrin. However, a major aspect of its unstable nature was attributed to its antiaromatic character, which is understood to destabilize the macrocycle upon conjugation. Antiaromaticity in general has not gained significant attention mainly due to the lack of stable 4n\u03c0 systems. In this regard, a stable isophlorin and its derivatives provide a glimmering hope to peek into the world of antiaromatic systems. This review will focus on the attempted synthesis of antiaromatic isophlorin ever since its conception. Based on recent synthetic advances, the chemistry of isophlorins can be expected to blossom into expanded derivatives of this antiaromatic macrocycle. Along with the synthetic details, the structural, electronic, and redox properties of isophlorin and its expanded derivatives will be elaborated.",

The energetics comes in two flavors: (1) An appropriate position of the long-wavelength absorption band of each macrocycle, which in large part determines the excited-state energy level. Control of the latter parameter is essential for flow of excited-state energy in the antennas and from the antenna to the reaction centers. (2) An appropriate level of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for those molecules to facilitate, or preclude, electron-transfer processes. The electron transfer from one photosynthetic pigment to another generates a hole in the HOMO of the donor and single occupancy of the former LUMO of the acceptor. Control over redox potentials is essential for efficient charge-separation processes.\n\nThe absorption spectra of two native photosynthetic tetrapyrrole macrocycles, bacteriopheophytin a and pheophytin a (where \"pheo\" implies the free base macrocycle), are shown in Figure 3. The spectra are compared with those of core macrocycles that lack any substituents other than a gem-dimethyl group in each pyrroline ring, namely, the chlorin H 2 C [30] and the bacteriochlorin H 2 BC [31]. The structures of the four macrocycles are shown in Chart 2. The core macrocycles lack ring E. The parameters corresponding to the spectra are listed in Table 1. The parameters for each band include the position of wavelength maximum (\u03bb abs , in nm), the full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm, in nm), and molar absorption coefficient (\u03b5, in M \u22121 cm \u22121 ). The spectra were obtained from the literature [30][31][32][33]. The spectra of additional native and synthetic macrocycles are available in PhotochemCAD [33][34][35]. and 0.05 mmol of each target macrocycle.

First, the absorption and emission spectra of all compounds were measured in acetonitrile (Figures 1 and 2). The 2\u2032-aminocalcones 2-4 show low to moderate fluorescence quantum yields, and large Stokes' shifts (5058-9883 cm \u22121 ) ( Table 1). The influence of the electrondonating group is observed, and compounds 2c, 3c and 4c, bearing a dimethylamino substituent, present a red shift on the absorption and emission maxima. They are also more emissive, with higher quantum yields of 0.03-0.35. For some compounds, the emission profile is not symmetric, and a second emission band appears with a lower intensity. This is consistent with the proposed ESIPT model. Considering the results obtained in acetonitrile, the photophysical properties of 2\u2032aminochalcones 2, 3 and 4 were evaluated in other organic solvents presenting different polarity. The solvents tested were dimethylsulfoxide, chloroform and diethyl ether, as examples of solvents with different polarity and proticity, with \u03c0* values determined by Kamlet and Taft [20] indicating the ability of a particular solvent to stabilize a charge or a dipole due to its dielectric effect, normalized between cyclohexane (\u03c0* = 0) and DMSO (\u03c0* = 1). The collected data revealed similar maxima wavelengths of absorption, but some differences in the emission maxima wavelengths (two maxima can be observed in some solvents, for compounds 2c, 3a, 3c and 4c) and the fluorescence quantum yield do not vary significantly ( Table 1). The general trend revealed that 2\u2032-aminochalcone 4c (para-position of ring B with dimethylamine and in ring A the acetyl-protected amine group) is the most fluorescent (with \u03a6F in the range of 0.32-0.36).",

The general route under development is shown in Scheme 1 panel a. An AD-half and a BC-half undergo Knoevenagel condensation [9] to form the corresponding Knoevenagel enone. The enone then undergoes a double-ring closure process via Nazarov cyclization [10] (forming ring E), electrophilic aromatic substitution (S E Ar, forming the macrocycle), and elimination of methanol, giving the aromatic macrocycle. The conditions for the Knoevenagel condensation entail 40 mM reactants (AD-half, BC-half) in acetonitrile containing piperidine, acetic acid, and molecular sieves at room temperature (overnight). The recently optimized conditions [7] for the one-flask, double-ring closure entail 0.20 mM reactant (Knoevenagel enone) in acetonitrile containing Yb(OTf) 3 at 80 \u2022 C (4 h).

The longest wavelength absorption bands around 280 nm correlate with the triazole core, while the thienyl substituent at the 1-position of the triazole shows a maximum at around 250 nm. Longer oligomer chains display bathochromically shifted longest wavelength absorption bands and symmetrical oligomers give more structured spectra. The length of the chain also affects the oxidation potentials of the compounds, where shorter oligomers possess higher potentials. A reduction potential for the triazole was not detected in the cyclic voltammograms under the given conditions.\n\nOxygen and nitrogen containing macrocycles with large cavities have a high binding affinity to numerous anion and  cation receptors, 25 proteins 26 and organic guest molecules. 27 The use of these ligands as model compounds for biological processes results from the possible complexation with biologically relevant anions. 28 The preparation of piperazinophanes 6 and the expanded cyclic dimers 7 was realized via an amine-aldehydealkyne (A 3 ) reaction 29 of piperazine and formaldehyde with aromatic bispropargylic ethers in the sense of the scaffold approach (Scheme 6). 30 The absorption maxima of piperazinophanes 6 and 7 appear between 243 and 356 nm. Systems with anthraquinone as an aromatic moiety also show a second weaker absorption band at 284 nm. In addition all macrocycles display intense luminescence with emission maxima between 432 and 501 nm. In the cyclic voltammograms irreversible reductions can be readily identified. Again the anthraquinone substituted macrocycles 6c and 7c possess several reduction peaks. The UV/Vis spectra of the compounds after complexation with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane show strongly red-shifted absorption bands at around 730, 750 and 770 nm, which were assigned to charge transfer transitions between the macrocycle and the guest molecule. The complexation ratio was photospectrometrically determined to result in a 1 : 1 complex.\n\n\nPhotoinduced electron transfer (PET) systems",

The result of core expansion is to produce systems with novel spectral and electronic features, interesting and, often unprecedented, cation-coordination properties, and, in many cases, an ability to bind anions in certain protonation states. Also adding to the appeal of expanded porphyrins is their central role in addressing issues of aromaticity.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Generally ureas are colorless crystalline solids, which, owing to the presence of fewer hydrogen bonds, exhibit melting points lower than that of urea itself. Synthesis Ureas can be prepared many methods, but rarely by direct carbonation, which is the route to urea itself. Instead, methods can be classified according those that assemble the urea functionality and those that start with preformed urea.

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug.

In addition, a concept for the design of natural/synthetic hybrid libraries is introduced. Although research in this area is still in its early stages, an important lesson to be learned from computational analyses is that there is no need to a priori 'shy away' from natural products as a source for molecular design.",

As databases of chemical space grow ever larger, data mining techniques and algorithms to enable chemists to efficiently explore this space are crucial; for example, algorithms to assess synthetic tractability or analyze structural properties would be tremendously valuable (Hoffmann and Gastreich, 2019). Ideal databases for drug discovery include those that are properly curated, complete with positive and negative data, and replete with examples to capture a wide breadth of existing chemical space. When paired with strong design algorithms, such databases can help researchers identify areas of chemical space yet to be explored and quickly sift through what has already been synthesized and tested. Below, we will detail the limitations of existing databases and the difficulties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of existing molecular generation algorithms.",

The frequency of the overall similarity coefficient is shown in Figure 6. It can be seen that the similarity span of molecules generated by the R group model is large, and many of the generated molecules have low similarity, and the number of molecules with research value is small; Most of the molecules generated by this model have a similarity interval of [60%, 90%]. The number of low similarity molecules is very small, and there are many molecules with research value. The test data show that the model in this paper shows good performance in terms of the similarity of the molecules generated from the zinc molecular data set. Figure 6. The molecule generated by the two models is similar to the original molecule In addition to the similarity shown in formation of a single new molecule, the molecular diversity shown in the formation of multiple new molecules is also important because it reflects the density of molecules in the underlying space [31] . The denser the molecules encoded in the potential space, the more kinds of molecules can be decoded, and the better the chemical space can be explored. To verify that SELFIES can increase the molecular density of potential Spaces, we'll use SELFIES and SMILES for experimental verification in this article. After training the data of both molecular representations using the models presented in this paper, a molecule was randomly selected from the test set and 200 samples were taken for each model respectively. The number of valid molecules was also calculated for the model using SMILES, after which similarity was sorted and statistical calculations were performed. We found that the model trained with SELFIES produced 77.5% of diverse molecules, while the model trained with SMILES produced 40.59% of diverse molecules, as shown in Figure 7. The SMILES curve often appears parallel to the horizontal axis, which indicates that the molecules in this part are the same. We shot a few times in parallel, which means that most of the molecules are different.",

Our approach generates hundreds of thousands of new binding site definitions in an automated fashion for arbitrary target ligand conformations, regardless of whether a complete binding site definition can be derived from an existing complex in the PDB. These binding site definitions yield thousands of RosettaMatch solutions that agree well with originally defined geometries. We also introduce a new design method that recapitulates key interactions in ligand binding sites. Moreover, we show that the new design method improves several metrics in design that are predictive of success when designs are experimentally characterized. While we have incorporated these new methods in Rosetta, the principles are generally applicable to other design approaches. The methods introduced here will have broad utility to design binders for arbitrary small molecules, towards predictable design of small molecule sensors, inducible transcription factors, and other functional proteins.2",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Isolating and identifying natural products has been important to source substances for early preclinical drug discovery research, to understand traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology, and to find pharmacologically useful areas of chemical space. To achieve this, many technological advances have been made, such as the evolution of technology associated with chemical separations, and the development of modern methods in chemical structure determination such as NMR. In addition, natural products are prepared by organic synthesis, to provide confirmation of their structure, or to give access to larger quantities of natural products of interest. In this process, the structure of some natural products have been revised, and the challenge of synthesising natural products has led to the development of new synthetic methodology, synthetic strategy, and",

However, chalcones have still not garnered deserved attention, especially considering their high potential as chemical sources for designing and developing new effective drugs. In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

While the structure of diatomic, triatomic or tetra-atomic molecules may be trivial, (linear, angular pyramidal etc.) the structure of polyatomic molecules, that are constituted of more than six atoms (of several elements) can be crucial for its chemical nature. Substance and mixture A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties. A collection of substances is called a mixture. Examples of mixtures are air and alloys. Mole and amount of substance The mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount). One mole is defined to contain exactly particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the number of particles per mole is known as the Avogadro constant. Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/dm3. Phase",

In addition, natural nucleosides and their analogs are critical in prebiotic chemistry, innate immunity, signaling, antiviral drug discovery and artificial synthesis of DNA / RNA sequences. Combined with the fact that quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) have been widely performed to understand their antiviral activity, nucleoside analogs could be used to benchmark generative molecular design. Here, we undertake the first generative design of nucleoside analogs using an approach that we refer to as the Conditional Randomized Transformer (CRT). We also benchmark our model against five previously published molecular generative models. We demonstrate that AI-generated molecules include nucleoside analogs that are of significance in a wide range of areas including prebiotic chemistry, antiviral drug discovery and synthesis of oligonucleotides. Our results show that CRT explores distinct molecular spaces and chemical transformations, some of which are similar to those undertaken by nature and medicinal chemists. Finally, we demonstrate the potential application of the CRT model in the generative design of molecules conditioned on Remdesivir and Molnupiravir as well as other nucleoside analogs with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2.One-Sentence Summary: Generative design of nucleoside analogs relevant to antiviral drug discovery, prebiotic chemistry and synthetic biology.Introduction: Genetic information of all life forms and viruses is stored in nucleic acid sequences which are linear polymers synthesized in cells by the polymerization of four distinct nucleotide triphosphates -adenosine (ATP), guanosine (GTP), cytidine (CTP), thymidine (TTP) and uridine (UTP, which replaces TTP in RNA). Each nucleotide consists of a purine or pyrimidine nitrogenous base attached to a ribose sugar (deoxyribose for DNA) together forming a nucleoside, linked to a triphosphate group. In addition to their role as the building blocks of DNA and RNA,",

The anti-viral therapy which is currently used is a mixture of interferon alpha-2a with ribavirin, but approximately half of the patients do not respond to therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to search for new compounds with anti-hepatitis C activity. Computer-aided drug design methodologies have been vital in the discovery of candidates to drugs.

These generated molecules were examined for synthesizability, not included in Ligand GA. The software was designed for including geometric and molecular chemical constraints, and these can be included without changing the software. It was also written to interface with existing databases of molecules and drugs for input in the GA's evolution and in using SMILES chromosomes in the post analysis.\n\nThe Ligand GA software, its structure, and the design methodology is explained. The software package download contains the Matlab code, documentation, and directories with the example inputs and outputs. There are instructions to use the software with minimal effort. The software is designed to expand by including constraints in the fitness function which are not included in this version.\n\nResults from modifying Aspirin and Simeprevir are presented, in both of which there are thousands of generated molecules. These molecules illustrate the use of the software and also the design methodology, particularly in using constraints on the molecules. These molecules have higher docking and binding scores but also illustrate the specificity of the molecular construction in ADME restriction and localization within their corresponding protein binding sites.\n\nThe 30 CPU cluster typically has an extremely high but manageable load especially as the molecules evolve depending on their complexity. Scalability is built into Ligand GA. More computing resources and computing time enables a more thorough search and more specific results. Tuning the various parameters is also discussed.\n\n[Note: Since the initial paper submission Ligand GA has been generalized to Ligand Multi-Protein GA and coded to use a multi-protein system: high binding/interaction of a small molecule to a target protein, low binding/interaction to a set of others, or any combination. The original Ligand GA objective function is also now multi-objective with only 1 protein: one function to maximize is the overall interaction score from docking and the second is the interaction score per atom to maximize for specificity. Both of these together are a significant improvement. Fragment based design has also been included with a structural constraint on a portion of the initial molecule population, applying Ligand GA to build ideal fragments to of a total molecule for potency and biochemical activity. In addition, there were efficiency improvements in the calculations and memory handling.",

The present contribution starts with a critical analysis of the potentiality of the structure based design and then reviews its methods. Protein crystallography, NMR, homology modelling and the use of antibodies are either referenced or briefly described as the methods which are able to provide us with the atomic structure of receptors. The search of lead molecules by data base mining and by generating structures with computers is discussed. Various methods and computer programs for calculating the interaction energy between receptors and ligands are reviewed. Several examples of successful structure base design are cited and some of them are briefly discussed.",

A key step of an automated computational design algorithm is molecule generation, where the machine is required to design high-quality, drug-like molecules within the appropriate chemical space. Many algorithms have been proposed for molecular generation; however, a challenge is how to assess the validity of the resulting molecules. Here, we report three Turing-inspired tests designed to evaluate the performance of molecular generators. Profound differences were observed between the performance of molecule generators in these tests, highlighting the importance of selection of the appropriate design algorithms for specific circumstances. One molecule generator, based on match molecular pairs, performed excellently against all tests and thus provides a valuable component for machine-driven medicinal chemistry design workflows.",

SYNOPSIS designs novel molecules by starting from a database of available molecules and simulating organic synthesis steps. This way of generating molecules imposes synthetic accessibility on the molecules. In addition to a starting database, a fitness function is needed that calculates the value of a desired property for an arbitrary molecule. The values obtained from this function guide the design process in optimizing the molecules toward an optimal value of the calculated property. Two applications are described. The first uses an electric dipole moment calculation to generate molecules possessing a strong dipole moment. The second makes use of the three-dimensional structure of a viral enzyme in order to generate high affinity ligands. Twenty eight compounds designed with the program resulted in 18 synthesized and tested compounds, 10 of which showed HIV inhibitory activity in vitro.",

The right panel of the web page is updated every minute to follow the design over the generations. Each row summarizes the features of the best candidate of the generation: the generation number, the rank, the score in percentage (the maximum is 100%), the molecular properties of the selected conformer, the fragment composition and the number of the best conformer. The left panel displays the molecule in 3D alone or in complex with a binding site if the scoring function includes a docking score. A click on the molecule name at the right panel executes the display at the left window. Molecules and complexes are also downloadable in sdf, mol2 and pdb file format, respectively. If several conformers have been generated for one molecule, the sdf file contains the coordinates of the best one whereas the mol2 file contains its docking pose conformation. There is also a link at the top of the right page to download the concatenated sdf file of the best candidates.

In most cases, the focus of each summary in text is the theoretical model (e.g. VAE, GNN, GAN, etc.), their variants, and the modifications made to render these models/variants capable of handling specific tasks in drug design (e.g. molecule generation under the low-data scheme, 3-D molecule design, molecule generation given the disease context, molecule optimization with a fixed scaffold, generation of molecules with guaranteed synthesizability, etc.). This survey should be particularly helpful to the readers who have some background in DL and want to learn the details of AI-based drug design comprehensively and rapidly with the help of many examples. Survey organization. Except Section 1 and 9, each section centers around one or more AI technique(s). In each of these sections, theoretical development of the AI technique(s) is first explained, and relevant applications follow the explanation of the theory one by one. Specifically, Section 2 covers the theory about perceptron, MLP, CNN, GNN, and their applications in molecular property prediction. Topics of Section 3 to 8 are RNN, RL, VAE, GAN, flow, and Mont Carlo tree search (MCTS) respectively. Applications for molecule generation and optimization (those that are summarized in the text) are included in these sections. Section 9 ends the survey with discussion, challenges, and conclusion about the AI-based drug design. Key abbreviations used in this survey are in Table 2.",

Until then a rational, target-aimed design of drugs was not possible, because the molecular basis of disease was largely unexplored. The progress in basic science has revealed that many diseases are caused by the malfunction of proteins. These proteins are targets for drugs, which should bind to the protein and inhibit its function. Knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the target protein is helpful to find binding pockets for the drug on the molecular surface. The strategy of this knowledge-based or structure-based drug-design is explained with the help of several examples for recently approved drugs, antivirals against influenza and AIDS, and a drug against a rare cancer, chronic myeloic leukemia.",

The population information at each iteration is stored in a Matlab data file that can be loaded into a Matlab session. It contains a cell array with the population of the molecules and the best fitnesses of these molecules. It does not include the stereoisomer individuals because non-isomeric SMILES is used, but this information of the molecule stereoisomers can be obtained by using the Ligand GA Fitness Function GOLD on any non-isomeric SMILES expression, or any set of molecules within a cell array input to this function.\n\nOutput and post-processing. The script Ligand GA Output Function will take in the output .dat file and produce a sorted and unique list of molecules from the stored population information. The list can be used for a number of reasons, including the viability as a drug and the inspection in a medicinal chemical view towards synthesis. The list is also useful for examination of various biochemical properties and in comparison with www.nature.com/scientificreports/ existing databases such as PubChem. An example is to find out if any known and/or FDA approved drugs are structurally similar.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nA new software package, Ligand GA, is introduced that enables the construction of small molecules that are potential therapeutic or anti-viral drug candidates. The construction requires the information of the protein binding site and an initial set of small molecules. Ligand GA outputs lists of high scoring molecules in docking and binding which are designed according to multiple user criteria. The criteria can be very specific such as amino acid specific localization, ADME restriction, required hydrogen bonding, toxicity, and inclusion of database information. Ligand GA has concise code which uses the textual non-isomeric SMILES format for the chromosomes and their manipulations. It also uses several proprietary external software: Matlab, Corina Classic, and CSD GOLD. The use of the software does not generate absolute results due to the nature of the genetic algorithm and the extremely complicated fitness (binding interactions of molecules), but it is useful for finding high affinity ligand binders. Ligand GA can be stopped during a run, then after an examination of the total output of the stored population from the iterations, can be restarted with a selection of these molecules either unchanged or manually edited. Running, restarting, running, \u2026 can improve results both in binding score and in types of molecules desired particular to the protein site amino acids desired to be chemically inhibited, amongst others.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Substance and mixture A chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties. A collection of substances is called a mixture. Examples of mixtures are air and alloys. Mole and amount of substance The mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance (also called chemical amount). One mole is defined to contain exactly particles (atoms, molecules, ions, or electrons), where the number of particles per mole is known as the Avogadro constant. Molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution, and is commonly reported in mol/dm3. Phase",

While the tenets of the field were originally implicitly founded on the use of chemistry to create those parts, its modern incarnation has focused on the use of parts assembled from natural components or components intended to mimic their natural counterparts. This would seem justified by the eons of evolution that optimized the natural components for functioning in a cell, at least for a similar function. However, most natural components are recognized by or interact with multiple other components in every cell, possibly in unknown ways, and thus their introduction may have unintended consequences. While truly synthetic parts made by chemists do not benefit from eons of evolution, they are foreign to cells, possibly even drawing upon forces not used by their natural counterparts, and thus they may be more orthogonal and possibly easier to introduce and optimize without perturbation. In this case, optimization must proceed with less information, because less is known about how the parts might interact with their biological targets, and the methodology and lessons of medicinal chemistry, which conceptually face essentially the same challenges, provide the blueprint for success. If the combination of synthetic and medicinal-like chemistry can produce molecules that function alongside those evolved by nature for the most central of its processes, to store and retrieve information, then this approach is likely to be capable of discovering molecules that effectively participate in any biological process, potentially opening a new vista for chemists in synthetic biology.   \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank former and current members of the Romesberg group, as well as those of our collaborators in the Dwyer and Marx groups for their contributions to the research highlighted in this Account.\n\n\u25a0 REFERENCES\n\nFigure 1 .\n1dNaM-dTPT3, dZ-dP, and dDs-dPx (R = H or \u2212CH(OH)\u2212CH 2 OH) UBPs.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2(A) First generation methylated benzene and naphthalene analogs.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

Although obvious, its application to the synthesis of molecules for biology and medicine was not always the purpose of total synthesis. In recent years, however, the field has acquired momentum as its power to reach higher molecular complexity and diversity is increasing, and as the demand for rare bioactive natural products and their analogues is expanding due to their recognised potential to facilitate biology and drug discovery and development. Today this component of total synthesis endeavors is considered highly desirable, and could be part of interdisciplinary academic and/or industrial partnerships, providing further inspiration and momentum to the field. In this review we provide a brief historical background of the emergence of the field of total synthesis as it relates to making molecules for biology and medicine. We then discuss specific examples of this practice from our laboratories as they developed over the years. The review ends with a conclusion and future perspectives for natural products chemistry and its applications to biology and medicine and other added-value contributions to science and society.",

The software DOGS (Design of Genuine Structures) features a ligand-based strategy for automated 'in silico' assembly of potentially novel bioactive compounds. The quality of the designed compounds is assessed by a graph kernel method measuring their similarity to known bioactive reference ligands in terms of structural and pharmacophoric features. We implemented a deterministic compound construction procedure that explicitly considers compound synthesizability, based on a compilation of 25'144 readily available synthetic building blocks and 58 established reaction principles. This enables the software to suggest a synthesis route for each designed compound. Two prospective case studies are presented together with details on the algorithm and its implementation. De novo designed ligand candidates for the human histamine H\u2084 receptor and \u03b3-secretase were synthesized as suggested by the software. The computational approach proved to be suitable for scaffold-hopping from known ligands to novel chemotypes, and for generating bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.",

However, the chemical structure of natural products covers a wide spectrum from very simple to complex. With more complex structures it is often desirable to simplify the molecule whilst retaining the desired biological activity. This approach seeks to identify the structural unit or pharmacophore responsible for the desired activity. Such pharmacophores have been the start point for a wide range of lead generation and optimisation programmes using techniques such as Biology Oriented Synthesis, Diversity Oriented Synthesis, Diverted Total Synthesis, and Fragment Based Drug Discovery. This review discusses the literature precedence of simplification strategies in four areas of natural product research: proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and compounds isolated from natural product extracts, and their impact on identifying therapeutic products.

Perspectives from nearly five decades of total synthesis of natural products and their analogues for biology and medicine.Nat.Prod The idea of a \"supernatural product\" has been the basis for the field since its inception.Now, however, the emerging tools of bioassay and computational prediction, combined with the fundamental science of synthesis, place these once-distant mountains closer than ever before.\n\n\n\nProfessor A. Fredga, introduction to the 1965 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to R. B. Woodward (ref 11)\n\n\nFigure 2 .\n2\nFigure 2. Structure dictates function.Molecules can be parametrized and their properties can be plotted to lie in different regions of a \"chemical space\".\n\n\nFigure 1 .\n1\nFigure1.Purpose dictates strategy: types of syntheses.These cartoons depict a chemical space where axes are molecular parameters, points indicate molecules, and lines depict chemical reactions.Target-oriented synthesis (or total synthesis) identifies a single molecule for synthesis and navigates challenges in reactivity to reach this goal, much like climbing a mountain.Open circles and dashed lines depict failed routes, which often occur with dense bond networks that complicate synthesis.Divergent or diverted syntheses will use or design a route to reach analogues of a target; consideration of how and where to diversify a structure will affect route design.Combinatorial synthesis seeks to make collections of molecules (molecular libraries) for high-throughput screening.In traditional libraries, these tend to be large numbers of closely related structures, i.e., nondiverse.Diversity-oriented synthesis seeks to access broadly distributed collections of small molecules, inspired by the importance of diversity in the evolution of function.29",

For each molecule that they describe, the authors present a historical background, photographs of the main protagonists (we also need to know the faces and not only the names of the scientists who spend their lives for the benefit of humanity) and a description of the synthesis of the compound. I was fascinated to learn that salicin (the precursor of aspirin W ) was advocated in ancient Egypt some 3,500 years ago. The ancient Egyptians knew about the beneficial effects of myrtle bark (which contains salicin) on rheumatism and back pain. Similar is the story for the discovery of steroids from Mexican yams. And if you are ready for some mystery and intrigue, read the story of strychnine and how it was used as a poison for murder, along with other alkaloids, such as hemlock, which was used to execute Socrates. The discovery of Taxol W was the result of a major effort in the USA from 1960 to 1981 to identify anticancer ingredients from natural sources (did you know that 110,000 substances from 35,000 plant species were tested?). However, natural compounds are often very difficult to isolate in large quantities from plants. Thus, Taxol's total chemical synthesis (led by the Nicolaou and Holton teams) provided a drug that was much needed. The book appropriately ends with chapters on small molecules and biologics (antiviral agents and vaccines) and their importance in many different genetic diseases. This is the style for all the molecules in the book. You do not need to be a chemist to enjoy and follow the book. I highly recommend this elegant and unique book for every scientist and even for nonscientists with a desire to learn the effects of scientific endeavors in human history. It is a major achievement for the field and rightly so foreworded by two Nobel Prize winners, E.J. Corey and Ryoji Noyori.\n \u00a9 2012 Tsonis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

For example, a molecule with three points of diversity (R1, R2, and R3) can generate possible structures, where , , and are the numbers of different substituents utilized. The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

The set of molecules that react together are selected from a pool of molecules that are available at that point. This pool consists of a large set of initial, easy-to-obtain starting molecules (building blocks) and the intermediate products already created. The reaction steps continue in this manner until the final molecule M T is produced, where we make the assumption that all reactions are deterministic and produce a single primary product.\n\nFor example, consider the synthesis pathway for paracetamol, in Figure 1, which we will use as a running example to illustrate our approach. Here, the initial, easy-to-obtain building block molecules  Figure 1, with the corresponding DAG at that point in the sequence shown for three different time-points in the grey circles. The serialized construction sequence consists of a sequence of actions. These actions can be classified into belonging to three different types: (A1) node addition, (A2) building block molecular identity, and (A3) connectivity choice. By convention we start at the building block node that is furthest from the final product node, sampling randomly when two nodes are at equivalent distances.\n\nare shown in blue boxes. Reactions are signified with arrows, which produce a product molecule (outlined in green) from reactants. These product molecules can then become reactants themselves.\n\nIn general, this multi-step reaction pathway forms a synthesis DAG, which we shall denote M. Specifically, note that it is directed from reactants to products, and it is not cyclic, as we do not need to consider reactions that produce already obtained reactants.\n\n\nOur Models\n\nHere we describe a generative model of synthesis DAGs. This model can be used flexibly as part of a larger architecture or model, as shown in the second half of this section.\n\n\nA probabilistic generative model of synthesis DAGs",

Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

In other examples, natural products or intermediates have served as building blocks or scaffolds in the synthesis of complex natural products, bioactive analogues or designed hybrid molecules.

The software has been made available commercially since the acquisition as Synthia. Features The software was designed to combine long synthesis paths into shorter and more economical paths. The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself. It supports optimization of reactions by cost. The program also supports 3D modeling of individual molecules, as well as labeling of functional groups.",

Organic chemistry, and its unique ability to tailor natural products through synthesis, provides an extraordinary approach to unlock the full potential of natural products. In this Review, an approach based on natural product derived fragments is presented that can successfully address some of the current challenges in drug discovery. These fragments often display significantly reduced molecular weights, reduced structural complexity, a reduced number of synthetic steps, while retaining or even improving key biological parameters such as potency or selectivity. Examples from various stages of the drug development process up to the clinic are presented. In addition, this process can be leveraged by recent developments such as genome mining, antibody-drug conjugates, and computational approaches. All these concepts have the potential to identify the next generation of drug candidates inspired by natural products. ",

Noncanonical atropisomers-shape-defined molecules that are formally topologically trivial but are interconvertible only by complex, nonphysical multibond torsions-form a unique subset of atropisomers that differ from both canonical atropisomers (e.g., binaphthyls) and topoisomers (i.e., molecules that have identical connectivity but nonidentical molecular graphs). Small molecules, in contrast to biomacromolecules, are not expected to exhibit such ambiguous shapes. Using total synthesis, we found that the peptidic alkaloid tryptorubin A can be one of two noncanonical atropisomers. We then devised a synthetic strategy that drives the atropospecific synthesis of a noncanonical atrop-defined small molecule.",

Despite this promise, the synthesis of collections of macrocycles has been historically challenging due to difficulties in the formation of large rings. Diversity-Oriented Synthesis (DOS) emerged in the early 2000s as a powerful strategic solution to the construction of diverse molecular libraries. This review details the various strategies developed within the field of DOS for the synthesis of macrocycle libraries, utilizing modern synthetic methodology to deliver structurally diverse collections of macrocyclic molecules, and the exploration of their therapeutic potential. Section 1 of this work details the use of algorithmic strategies and is divided into Build/Couple/Pair, Advanced Build/Couple/Pair, Initiate/Propagate/Terminate, Fragment-Based Domain Shuffling, Two-Directional Synthesis, and Successive Ring Expansion. Section 2 covers strategies based on ring distortion reactions, including Sequential Cycloaddition/Fragmentation, Ring Expansions, and Miscellaneous.",

However, the chemical structure of natural products covers a wide spectrum from very simple to complex. With more complex structures it is often desirable to simplify the molecule whilst retaining the desired biological activity. This approach seeks to identify the structural unit or pharmacophore responsible for the desired activity. Such pharmacophores have been the start point for a wide range of lead generation and optimisation programmes using techniques such as Biology Oriented Synthesis, Diversity Oriented Synthesis, Diverted Total Synthesis, and Fragment Based Drug Discovery. This review discusses the literature precedence of simplification strategies in four areas of natural product research: proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and compounds isolated from natural product extracts, and their impact on identifying therapeutic products.

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Ordinarily, three-coordinated compounds adopt trigonal planar or pyramidal geometries. Examples of T-shaped molecules are the halogen trifluorides, such as ClF3. According to VSEPR theory, T-shaped geometry results when three ligands and two lone pairs of electrons are bonded to the central atom, written in AXE notation as AX3E2. The T-shaped geometry is related to the trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry for AX5 molecules with three equatorial and two axial ligands. In an AX3E2 molecule, the two lone pairs occupy two equatorial positions, and the three ligand atoms occupy the two axial positions as well as one equatorial position. The three atoms bond at 90\u00b0 angles on one side of the central atom, producing the T shape.",

However, chalcones have still not garnered deserved attention, especially considering their high potential as chemical sources for designing and developing new effective drugs. In this review, we summarize current methodological developments towards the design and synthesis of new chalcone derivatives and state-of-the-art medicinal chemistry strategies (bioisosterism, molecular hybridization, and pro-drug design). We also highlight the applicability of computer-assisted drug design approaches to chalcones and address how this may contribute to optimizing research outputs and lead to more successful and cost-effective drug discovery endeavors. Lastly, we present successful examples of the use of chalcones and suggest possible solutions to existing limitations.",

The software complements other attempts such as manual searching or semi-automated search tools. A molecule can be specified in multiple ways, including searching by Beilstein Registry Number, CAS registry number, chemical name, SMILES structure, or by drawing the molecule diagram itself.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

                    "contents": "OMG: Open Molecule GeneratorThe majority of structure generators rely on graph theory to produce their desired output. Interestingly, compounds can be represented as molecular graphs where atoms and bonds are translated into vertices and edges, respectively, to which theorems and algorithms proposed by graph theory can be applied. This ensures that the output is correct, exhaustive, and free of isomorphs. Such methods can be the orderly enumeration proposed by Read [19] and Faradzev [20], a stochastic generator [21], the homomorphism principle [22] used by MOLGEN, or the \"canonical augmentation path\" proposed by McKay [23]. This last method, originally intended to generate simple graphs by adding vertices, has been applied to the generation of some families of graphs and also to generate the chemical universe of molecules up to 11 atoms [24] and recently to 13 atoms [25]. Despite the goal was to generate molecules, these two approaches initially employed canonical path augmentation to generate all possible simple graphs up to 11 and 13 vertices, respectively. Posterior topological and ring system filter were used to remove unwanted graphs. Lastly, the vertices were colored with chemical elements and the edges with a bond order, which turned the graphs into molecules. Simple chemical constraints like connectivity and atom valence were applied to reduce the list of final molecules. This process, which relies on generating simple graph, is necessarily limited on the size of the molecules that can be generated because a linear increase in the number of atoms produces an exponential increase of both the number of graphs and molecules. Here we present the Open Molecule Generator (OMG), a structure generator based too on McKay augmentation algorithms, but rather than first generating graphs and secondly transforming these graphs into molecules, our implementation of McKay technique directly constructs molecules. In this way we can generate chemical structures much greater than 13 atoms. Essential concepts of graph theory will be introduced in the methods section.",

Since both generators produce the same molecules for elemental composition with C, O and H, we can only assume that more than two billion molecules could be generated. In the case of phenyllactic acid, MOLGEN produces more than 48 million molecules in 404 seconds. Due to excessive computational time, no results for this elemental composition are reported for OMG, though the same number of molecules is expected (if executed for enough time) as is the case for all the other elemental compositions in this subset. ** not available ** not available *Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures. However, we expect OMG to generate more molecules than MOLGEN, due to the larger amount of atom types produced by OMG. **Results were not generated due to excessive computational time needed to generate all the candidate structures.\n\nAs stated in Methods, both generators treat atoms having multiple valences in different ways, this is the reason to use a second set of molecules containing also N, P and S. The default valences used by MOLGEN for N is 3, for P is 3, and for S is 2, unless stated otherwise. The results for these molecules are presented in Table 3. As expected, the number of candidate structures differs between both generators. For the elemental composition of glycine, MOLGEN produces 84 molecules only with N valence 3 and 162 molecules only with N valence 5. For the same elemental composition, OMG produces 97 molecules with valence 3 and 5 for N, which include the 84 of MOLGEN N valence 3 and 13 additional molecules with valence 5, containing N with the atom types depicted in Table 1 for OMG-CDK. The difference in the number of candidate structures is larger for elemental compositions containing many atoms with multiple valences, as is the case of creatinine. For this metabolite, MOLGEN generates 93,323 candidate structures with the default valence 3 for N. On the contrary, OMG produces 303,601 candidate structures, containing N valence 3 and 5.",

Rather than being directed toward a single biological target, DOS libraries can be used to identify new ligands for a variety of targets. Several different strategies for library design have been developed to target the biologically relevant regions of chemical structure space. DOS has provided powerful probes to investigate biological mechanisms and also served as a new driving force for advancing synthetic organic chemistry.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Carbo-mers differ from their templates in size but not in symmetry when each C\u2013C single bond is replaced by an alkyne bond C-C\u2261C-C, each C=C double bond is replaced by an allene bond C=C=C=C, and each C\u2261C triple bond is replaced by C\u2261C-C\u2261C. The size of the carbo-mer continues to increase when more C2 units are inserted, so carbo-mers are also called carbon-molecules, where \"n\" is the number of acetylene or allene groups in an n-expansion unit. This concept, devised by R\u00e9mi Chauvin in 1995, is aimed at introducing new chemical properties for existing chemical motifs. Two distinct expansions of benzene can be called carbo-benzene (C18H6): One (above right) expands each C-H bond to C-C\u2261C-H, making hexaethynylbenzene, a substituted benzene derivative.",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

In 1950, Barton showed that organic molecules could be assigned a preferred conformation based upon results accumulated by chemical physicists, in particular by Odd Hassel. Using this new technique of conformational analysis, he later determined the geometry of many other natural product molecules.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

In this Perspective, written on the occasion of the 2005 American Chemical Society Arthur C.

A more accurate term is ligand design (i.e., design of a molecule that will bind tightly to its target). Although design techniques for prediction of binding affinity are reasonably successful, there are many other properties, such as bioavailability, metabolic half-life, side effects, etc., that first must be optimized before a ligand can become a safe and efficacious drug. These other characteristics are often difficult to predict with rational design techniques. Nevertheless, due to high attrition rates, especially during clinical phases of drug development, more attention is being focused early in the drug design process on selecting candidate drugs whose physicochemical properties are predicted to result in fewer complications during development and hence more likely to lead to an approved, marketed drug. Furthermore, in vitro experiments complemented with computation methods are increasingly used in early drug discovery to",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This short review describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. This notation helps to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

With regard to the latter point, natural products offer an outstanding source of biologically active molecules that provide many useful features that enable us to design innovative, biologically biased, synthetic compounds.

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

For example, a molecule with three points of diversity (R1, R2, and R3) can generate possible structures, where , , and are the numbers of different substituents utilized. The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries. Although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the 1990s, its roots can be seen as far back as the 1960s when a researcher at Rockefeller University, Bruce Merrifield, started investigating the solid-phase synthesis of peptides.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

In this Article, we analyze the occurrence of various FGs in molecules described in the medicinal chemistry literature over the last 40 years and show how their development and utilization over time has varied. The popularity of various FGs has not evolved randomly, but instead, clear patterns of use are evident. Various factors influencing these patterns, including the introduction of new synthetic methods, novel techniques, and strategies applied in drug discovery and the better knowledge of molecular properties affecting the success of candidate development, are discussed.",

Proven strategies include diverted total synthesis (DTS), function-oriented synthesis (FOS), biology-oriented synthesis (BIOS), complexity to diversity (CtD), hybrid molecules, and biosynthesis inspired synthesis. The latter includes mutasynthesis, the synthesis of natural products encoded by silent genes, and propionate scanning. Most of the examples from our group fall in the quite general concept of DTS. Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis. However, even for compounds of moderate complexity, organic synthesis remains a bottle neck. Unless some method for predicting the biological activity of a designed molecule becomes available, the design and synthesis of natural product analogues will remain what it is now, namely it will largely rely on trial and error.

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

Recognizing the usefulness of isosterism to design bioactive molecules, Friedman defined bioisosteres as compounds which fit the broadest definition for isosteres and have a similar type of biological activity, either through agonist or antagonist actions [39,40]. This definition has been further expended by Alfred Burger as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes and volumes, similar physicochemical properties, and which exhibit approximately the same distribution of electrons [40,41]. Today, the design of bioisosteres frequently introduces structural changes that, depending on the context, can be beneficial or deleterious. Electronic density, steric effects, polarizability, dipole, LogP and LogD, maintenance of intermolecular interactions, molecular conformation, LogS, and pK a potentially play key contributing roles in molecular recognition and mimicry [42,43].",

Here, we present and experimentally validate the computational design of enzyme activity in proteins of known structure. We have predicted mutations that introduce triose phosphate isomerase activity into ribose-binding protein, a receptor that normally lacks enzyme activity. The resulting designs contain 18 to 22 mutations, exhibit 10(5)- to 10(6)-fold rate enhancements over the uncatalyzed reaction, and are biologically active, in that they support the growth of Escherichia coli under gluconeogenic conditions. The inherent generality of the design method suggests that many enzymes can be designed by this approach.",

The de novo design software provides rapid access to tool compounds and starting points for the development of a lead candidate structure.

Instead, as we have seen, medicinal chemists continue to depend upon serendipitous discovery of novel biological activities and novel chemical entities for structures on which to begin work. What rational drug design really means at present is rational drug discovery and rational optimization. These result from the application of modern structural and mechanistic biochemistry, and good synthetic chemistry, to obtain structures with the desired spectrum of biological activities. Traditionally, lead compounds were discovered in plant and animal extracts, and more recently in microorganisms and chemical libraries. These traditional approaches continue, but are augmented by advances in molecular biology, which now provide pure proteins in quantity for screening and structure determination, as well as for characterization by modern biophysical methods. Remarkably, x-ray and NMR methods can now provide the most important information needed to design new drugs, that is, the conformations of ligands bound to target proteins. Approaches to identifying possible ligands based only on the knowledge of the enzyme active site are being developed. Some of these, such as CAVEAT, have been recently reviewed. In spite of these impressive gains, de novo design of new drugs will not be achieved until we learn how to logically build specific inhibitors of a target enzyme knowing only the protein sequence of the enzyme or the amino acid sequence of the messenger substances. We have a long way to go, because by this very rigorous definition, even the successful design of a new nonpeptide drug beginning with enzyme-ligand NMR or x-ray structure constitutes rational optimization. However, as this article has illustrated, we have made great progress. Some of the current and futuristic approaches to drug design are shown in Fig. 8. Development of useful enzyme inhibitors, designed by knowing the enzyme catalytic mechanism or discovered by screening for natural inhibitors, is a very successful rational method. Discovery of receptor antagonists by screening protocols is also productive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

The basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of a very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries.

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The design process involves manipulation of the input, modification of structural constraints, and further processing of the de novo-generated molecules using various modular toolkits. The development of a theoretical framework for each of these stages will provide novel practical solutions to the problem of creating compounds with maximal chemical diversity. This chapter describes the fundamental problems encountered in the application of novel chemical design technologies to chemical genomics by means of a formal representation. Formal representations help to outline and clarify ideas and hypotheses that can then be explored using mathematical algorithms. It is only by developing this rigorous foundation, that in silico design can progress in a rational way.",

In this work we introduce the first open source structure generator, Open Molecule Generator (OMG), which for a given elemental composition produces all non-isomorphic chemical structures that match that elemental composition. Furthermore, this structure generator can accept as additional input one or multiple non-overlapping prescribed substructures to drastically reduce the number of possible chemical structures. Being open source allows for customization and future extension of its functionality. OMG relies on a modified version of the Canonical Augmentation Path, which grows intermediate chemical structures by adding bonds and checks that at each step only unique molecules are produced. In order to benchmark the tool, we generated chemical structures for the elemental formulas and substructures of different metabolites and compared the results with a commercially available structure generator. The results obtained, i.e. the number of molecules generated, were identical for elemental compositions having only C, O and H. For elemental compositions containing C, O, H, N, P and S, OMG produces all the chemically valid molecules while the other generator produces more, yet chemically impossible, molecules. The chemical completeness of the OMG results comes at the expense of being slower than the commercial generator. In addition to being open source, OMG clearly showed the added value of constraining the solution space by using multiple prescribed substructures as input. We expect this structure generator to be useful in many fields, but to be especially of great importance for metabolomics, where identifying unknown metabolites is still a major bottleneck.",

Thus, in case an efficient strategy to a natural product is at hand, modifications are possible at almost any stage of a synthesis.

The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties.

While the tenets of the field were originally implicitly founded on the use of chemistry to create those parts, its modern incarnation has focused on the use of parts assembled from natural components or components intended to mimic their natural counterparts. This would seem justified by the eons of evolution that optimized the natural components for functioning in a cell, at least for a similar function. However, most natural components are recognized by or interact with multiple other components in every cell, possibly in unknown ways, and thus their introduction may have unintended consequences. While truly synthetic parts made by chemists do not benefit from eons of evolution, they are foreign to cells, possibly even drawing upon forces not used by their natural counterparts, and thus they may be more orthogonal and possibly easier to introduce and optimize without perturbation. In this case, optimization must proceed with less information, because less is known about how the parts might interact with their biological targets, and the methodology and lessons of medicinal chemistry, which conceptually face essentially the same challenges, provide the blueprint for success. If the combination of synthetic and medicinal-like chemistry can produce molecules that function alongside those evolved by nature for the most central of its processes, to store and retrieve information, then this approach is likely to be capable of discovering molecules that effectively participate in any biological process, potentially opening a new vista for chemists in synthetic biology.   \n\n\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank former and current members of the Romesberg group, as well as those of our collaborators in the Dwyer and Marx groups for their contributions to the research highlighted in this Account.\n\n\u25a0 REFERENCES\n\nFigure 1 .\n1dNaM-dTPT3, dZ-dP, and dDs-dPx (R = H or \u2212CH(OH)\u2212CH 2 OH) UBPs.\n\nFigure 2 .\n2(A) First generation methylated benzene and naphthalene analogs.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

In the context of individual programs and along with a summary of our work, selected cases are presented that illustrate the impact single atom changes can have on the biological properties of the compounds. The examples were chosen to highlight single heavy atom changes that improve activity, rather than those that involve informative alterations that reduce or abolish activity. The examples were also chosen to illustrate that the impact of such single-atom changes can originate from steric, electronic, conformational, or H-bonding effects, from changes in functional reactivity, from fundamental intermolecular interactions with a biological target, from introduction of a new or altered functionalization site, or from features as simple as improvements in stability or physical properties. Nearly all the examples highlighted represent not only unusual instances of productive deep-seated natural product modifications and were introduced through total synthesis but are also remarkable in that they are derived from only a single heavy atom change in the structure.",

These discoveries set in motion a revolution that shaped the landscape of the molecular sciences and changed the world. Organic synthesis played a major role in this revolution through its ability to construct the molecules of the living world and others like them whose primary element is carbon. Although the early beginnings of organic synthesis came about serendipitously, organic chemists quickly recognized its potential and moved decisively to advance and exploit it in myriad ways for the benefit of mankind. Indeed, from the early days of the synthesis of urea and the construction of the first carbon-carbon bond, the art of organic synthesis improved to impressively high levels of sophistication. Through its practice, today chemists can synthesize organic molecules--natural and designed--of all types of structural motifs and for all intents and purposes. The endeavor of constructing natural products--the organic molecules of nature--is justly called both a creative art and an exact science. Often called simply total synthesis, the replication of nature's molecules in the laboratory reflects and symbolizes the state of the art of synthesis in general. In the last few decades a surge in total synthesis endeavors around the world led to a remarkable collection of achievements that covers a wide ranging landscape of molecular complexity and diversity. In this article, we present highlights of some of our contributions in the field of total synthesis of natural products of biological and medicinal importance. For perspective, we also provide a listing of selected examples of additional natural products synthesized in other laboratories around the world over the last few years.",

The complete list of reactions is provided in Table S1 in Text S1, supplementary material. Out of the 58 unique reactions, 34 describe ring formations. All reactions require one or two reactants (referred to as oneor two-component reactions, respectively) and result in a single product (ARB; A+BRC).

Only a single known reference compound is required to have the computer come up with suggestions for potentially isofunctional molecules. A specific feature of the algorithm is its capability to propose a synthesis plan for each designed compound, based on a large set of readily available molecular building blocks and established reaction protocols. The de novo design software provides rapid access to tool compounds and starting points for the development of a lead candidate structure. The manuscript gives a detailed description of the algorithm. Theoretical analysis and prospective case studies demonstrate its ability to propose bioactive, plausible and chemically accessible compounds. extraction of the final set of building blocks by a three-step preparation protocol.\n\nIn the first step, building blocks were standardized, and unsuitable entries were eliminated.
