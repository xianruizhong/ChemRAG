Replacement by a thiol group Diazonium salts can be converted to thiols in a two-step procedure. Treatment of benzenediazonium chloride with potassium ethylxanthate followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate xanthate ester gives thiophenol: C6H5N2+ + C2H5OCS2- -> C6H5SC(S)OC2H5 C6H5SC(S)OC2H5 + H2O -> C6H5SH + HOC(S)OC2H5 Replacement by an aryl group The aryl group can be coupled to another using arenediazonium salts. For example, treatment of benzenediazonium chloride with benzene (an aromatic compound) in the presence of sodium hydroxide gives diphenyl: [C6H5N2+]Cl- + C6H6 -> C6H5-C6H5 + N2 + HCl This reaction is known as the Gomberg–Bachmann reaction.

Uses Oxidation of alcohols PCC is used as an oxidant. In particular, it has proven to be highly effective in oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The reagent is more selective than the related Jones reagent, so there is little chance of over-oxidation to form carboxylic acids as long as water is not present in the reaction mixture. A typical PCC oxidation involves addition of an alcohol to a suspension of PCC in dichloromethane. The general reaction is: 2 [C5H5NH][CrO3Cl] + 3 R2CHOH → 2 [C5H5NH]Cl + Cr2O3 + 3 R2C=O + 3 H2O For example, the triterpene lupeol was oxidized to lupenone:",

Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2]. Ketones are produced by carbonylation of these dialkyl complexes, regenerating CpCo(CO)2.",

Each state contributes differently to the reaction mechanisms that can take place. A simple test used to determine which state is involved is to make use of the diagnostic reaction of the triplet state with O2, if the reaction yield is unchanged it indicates that the singlet state is involved. The diradical ground-state normally undergoes abstraction reactions. Atomic carbon has been used to generate \"true\" carbenes by the abstraction of oxygen atoms from carbonyl groups: R2C=O + :C: → R2C: + CO",

For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2.

In organometallic chemistry the nucleophilic abstraction reaction occurs with a nucleophilic substitution mechanism. Unsaturated carbon centres Nucleophilic substitution via the SN1 or SN2 mechanism does not generally occur with vinyl or aryl halides or related compounds. Under certain conditions nucleophilic substitutions may occur, via other mechanisms such as those described in the nucleophilic aromatic substitution article. When the substitution occurs at the carbonyl group, the acyl group may undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. This is the normal mode of substitution with carboxylic acid derivatives such as acyl chlorides, esters and amides. References External links",

The use of X-ray crystallography showed that while the FeMo cofactor is not in its catalytic form, the carbon keeps the structure rigid which helps describe the reactivity of nitrogenase.",

SO3 + ClCN → ClSO2NCO In this transformation, both the carbon and the nitrogen termini of CN are functionalized. The structure of CSI is represented as ClS(O)2-N=C=O. It consists of two electron-withdrawing components, the chlorosulfonyl group (SO2Cl) and the isocyanate group (-N=C=O). Because of its resulting electrophilicity, the use of CSI in chemical synthesis requires relatively inert solvents such as chlorocarbons, acetonitrile, and ethers.

Uses Oxidation of alcohols PCC is used as an oxidant. In particular, it has proven to be highly effective in oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The reagent is more selective than the related Jones reagent, so there is little chance of over-oxidation to form carboxylic acids as long as water is not present in the reaction mixture. A typical PCC oxidation involves addition of an alcohol to a suspension of PCC in dichloromethane.

Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2].

Replacement by a trifluoromethyl group Two research groups reported trifluoromethylations of diazonium salts in 2013. Goossen reported the preparation of a CuCF3 complex from CuSCN, TMSCF3, and Cs2CO3. In contrast, Fu reported the trifluoromethylation using Umemoto's reagent (S-trifluoromethyldibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate) and Cu powder (Gattermann-type conditions). They can be described by the following equation: C6H5N2+ + [CuCF3] -> C6H5CF3 + [Cu]+ + N2 The bracket indicates that other ligands on copper are likely present but are omitted.

Uses Oxidation of alcohols PCC is used as an oxidant. In particular, it has proven to be highly effective in oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The reagent is more selective than the related Jones reagent, so there is little chance of over-oxidation to form carboxylic acids as long as water is not present in the reaction mixture.

C6H5C(CH3)2CH2Cl + 2Li → C6H5C(CH3)2CH2Li + LiCl Neophyl chloride is of interest to organic chemists due to its substitution properties. Neophyl chloride is a neopentyl halide which means it is subject to the neopentyl effect.

In contrast, Fu reported the trifluoromethylation using Umemoto's reagent (S-trifluoromethyldibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate) and Cu powder (Gattermann-type conditions). They can be described by the following equation: C6H5N2+ + [CuCF3] -> C6H5CF3 + [Cu]+ + N2 The bracket indicates that other ligands on copper are likely present but are omitted.

Examples include oxalic anhydride (C2O3 or O=(C2O)=O), ethylene dione (C2O2 or O=C=C=O) and other linear or cyclic polymers of carbon monoxide (-CO-)n (polyketones), and linear or cyclic polymers of carbon dioxide (-CO2-)n, such as the dimer 1,3-dioxetanedione (C2O4).",

Although monoalkyne complexes CpCo(CO)(R1C2R2) have not been isolated, their analogues, CpCo(PPh3)(R1C2R2) are made by the following reactions: CpCo(CO)2 + PR3 → CO + CpCo(CO)(PR3) CpCoL(PR3) + R2C2 → L + CpCo(PR3)(R2C2) (where L = CO or PR3) CpCo(CO)2 catalyzes the formation of pyridines from a mixture of alkynes and nitriles. Reduction of CpCo(CO)2 with sodium yields the dinuclear radical [Cp2Co2(CO)2]−, which reacts with alkyl halides to give the dialkyl complexes [Cp2Co2(CO)2R2].

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

Uses Oxidation of alcohols PCC is used as an oxidant. In particular, it has proven to be highly effective in oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The reagent is more selective than the related Jones reagent, so there is little chance of over-oxidation to form carboxylic acids as long as water is not present in the reaction mixture. A typical PCC oxidation involves addition of an alcohol to a suspension of PCC in dichloromethane.

If the ylide carbon is substituted with an alkyl group the reagent is referred to as an unstabilized ylide. The size of the alkyl groups are the major factors in selectivity with these reagents.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches.

With aqueous base, acyl cyanides break down to cyanide and the carboxylate: RC(O)CN + 2NaOH → RCO2Na + NaCN + H2O With azides, acyl cyanides undergo the click reaction to give acyl tetrazoles.

They are rarely isolated during the course of the ozonolysis reaction sequence. Molozonides are unstable and rapidly convert to the trioxolane ring structure with a five-membered C–O–O–C–O ring. They usually appear in the form of foul-smelling oily liquids, and rapidly decompose in the presence of water to carbonyl compounds: aldehydes, ketones, peroxides.

Chemical kinetics Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by the use of chemical kinetics to determine the rate equation and the reaction order in each reactant. Consider the following reaction for example: CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO In this case, experiments have determined that this reaction takes place according to the rate law . This form suggests that the rate-determining step is a reaction between two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is: 2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow) NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)",

This kind of reaction produces stable side products, reactants, or intermediates and slows the propagation reaction by lowering the number of radicals available to propagate the chain reaction. There are many different termination combinations, some examples are: Union of methyl radicals from a C-C bond leading to ethane (a side product). CH3. + CH3. -> CH3-CH3",

Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex.

Goossen reported the preparation of a CuCF3 complex from CuSCN, TMSCF3, and Cs2CO3. In contrast, Fu reported the trifluoromethylation using Umemoto's reagent (S-trifluoromethyldibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate) and Cu powder (Gattermann-type conditions).

C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC.

One laboratory method entails thermal decomposition of mercuric cyanide: 2 Hg(CN)2 → (CN)2 + Hg2(CN)2 Alternatively, one can combine solutions of copper(II) salts (such as copper(II) sulfate) with cyanides; an unstable copper(II) cyanide is formed which rapidly decomposes into copper(I) cyanide and cyanogen. 2 CuSO4 + 4 KCN → (CN)2 + 2 CuCN + 2 K2SO4 Industrially, it is created by the oxidation of hydrogen cyanide, usually using chlorine over an activated silicon dioxide catalyst or nitrogen dioxide over a copper salt.

Writing SMILES for substituted rings in this way can make them more human-readable. Branches may be written in any order. For example, bromochlorodifluoromethane may be written as FC(Br)(Cl)F, BrC(F)(F)Cl, C(F)(Cl)(F)Br, or the like. Generally, a SMILES form is easiest to read if the simpler branch comes first, with the final, unparenthesized portion being the most complex. The only caveats to such rearrangements are: If ring numbers are reused, they are paired according to their order of appearance in the SMILES string. Some adjustments may be required to preserve the correct pairing. If stereochemistry is specified, adjustments must be made; see below.",

In contrast, Fu reported the trifluoromethylation using Umemoto's reagent (S-trifluoromethyldibenzothiophenium tetrafluoroborate) and Cu powder (Gattermann-type conditions).

Also, it is permitted to reuse ring numbers after the first ring has closed, although this usually makes formulae harder to read. For example, bicyclohexyl is usually written as C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2, but it may also be written as C0CCCCC0C0CCCCC0. Multiple digits after a single atom indicate multiple ring-closing bonds. For example, an alternative SMILES notation for decalin is C1CCCC2CCCCC12, where the final carbon participates in both ring-closing bonds 1 and 2. If two-digit ring numbers are required, the label is preceded by %, so C%12 is a single ring-closing bond of ring 12.",

For example, cyclopropene is usually written C1=CC1, but if the double bond is chosen as the ring-closing bond, it may be written as C=1CC1, C1CC=1, or C=1CC=1. (The first form is preferred.) C=1CC-1 is illegal, as it explicitly specifies conflicting types for the ring-closing bond. Ring-closing bonds may not be used to denote multiple bonds. For example, C1C1 is not a valid alternative to C=C for ethylene. However, they may be used with non-bonds; C1.C2.C12 is a peculiar but legal alternative way to write propane, more commonly written CCC. Choosing a ring-break point adjacent to attached groups can lead to a simpler SMILES form by avoiding branches. For example, cyclohexane-1,2-diol is most simply written as OC1CCCCC1O; choosing a different ring-break location produces a branched structure that requires parentheses to write.",

Uses Oxidation of alcohols PCC is used as an oxidant. In particular, it has proven to be highly effective in oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The reagent is more selective than the related Jones reagent, so there is little chance of over-oxidation to form carboxylic acids as long as water is not present in the reaction mixture. A typical PCC oxidation involves addition of an alcohol to a suspension of PCC in dichloromethane.

Some of these reactive carbon oxides were detected within molecular clouds in the interstellar medium by rotational spectroscopy. Many hypothetical oxocarbons have been studied by theoretical methods but have yet to be detected. Examples include oxalic anhydride (C2O3 or O=(C2O)=O), ethylene dione (C2O2 or O=C=C=O) and other linear or cyclic polymers of carbon monoxide (-CO-)n (polyketones), and linear or cyclic polymers of carbon dioxide (-CO2-)n, such as the dimer 1,3-dioxetanedione (C2O4).",

The constitution of organocopper compounds depends on their method of preparation and the various kinds of organocopper reagents exhibit different reactivity profiles. As a result, the scope of reactions involving organocopper reagents is extremely broad. Organocopper complexes (RCu) are produced when a copper(I) halide and organolithium are combined.

Uses Oxidation of alcohols PCC is used as an oxidant. In particular, it has proven to be highly effective in oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols to aldehydes and ketones, respectively. The reagent is more selective than the related Jones reagent, so there is little chance of over-oxidation to form carboxylic acids as long as water is not present in the reaction mixture.
