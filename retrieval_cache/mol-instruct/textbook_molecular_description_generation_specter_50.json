In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

You can't superimpose a model of this molecule on a model of its mirror image for the same reason that you can't superimpose a left hand on a right hand: they simply aren't the same.\n\n\nFIGURE 5.2 Tetrahedral carbon atoms and their mirror images. Molecules of the type $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{CH}_{2} \\mathrm{XY}$ are identical to their mirror images, but a molecule of the type CHXYZ is not. $\\mathrm{A} C H X Y Z$ molecule is related to its mirror image in the same way a right hand is related to a left hand.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

It states that valence electrons will assume an electron-pair geometry that minimizes repulsions between areas of high electron density (bonds and/or lone pairs). Molecular structure, which refers only to the placement of atoms in a molecule and not the electrons, is equivalent to electron-pair geometry only when there are no lone electron pairs around the central atom. A dipole moment measures a separation of charge. For one bond, the bond dipole moment is determined by the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. For a molecule, the overall dipole moment is determined by both the individual bond moments and how these dipoles are arranged in the molecular structure. Polar molecules (those with an appreciable dipole moment) interact with electric fields, whereas nonpolar molecules do not.",

Understanding organic chemistry means knowing not just what happens but also why and how it happens at the molecular level. In this chapter, we'll look at some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation to understand the specific reactions discussed in subsequent chapters. Topics such as bond polarity, the acid-base behavior of molecules, and hydrogen-bonding are a particularly important part of that foundation.\n\nWe saw in the previous chapter how covalent bonds between atoms are described, and we looked at the valence\nbond model, which uses hybrid orbitals to account for the observed shapes of organic molecules. Before going on to a systematic study of organic chemistry, however, we still need to review a few fundamental topics. In particular, we need to look more closely at how electrons are distributed in covalent bonds and at some of the consequences that arise when the electrons in a bond are not shared equally between atoms.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

An empirical formula gives the simplest, whole-number ratio of atoms in a compound. A structural formula indicates the bonding arrangement of the atoms in the molecule. Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole. Experimental measurements have determined the number of entities composing 1 mole of substance to be $6.022 \\times 10^{23}$, a quantity called Avogadro's number.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable.

The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group. For example, $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{F}$ is $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}, \\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Cl}$ is $330 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$, and $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{Br}$ is $275 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nBond Energies (kJ/mol)",

As we've seen, organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Although a division into organic and inorganic chemistry occurred historically, there is no scientific reason for the division.\n\nAn atom consists of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by one or more negatively charged electrons. The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases.

Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break.

Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole.

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms.

Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

The subject can be a bit complex but is so important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.\n\nAn object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning \"handed.\" A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups-a so-called chirality center. Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either $\\boldsymbol{R}$ (rectus) or $\\boldsymbol{S}$ (sinister) by using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the direction of decreasing rank $(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the $R$ configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the $S$ configuration.\n\nSome molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound with $n$ chirality centers can have a maximum of $2^{n}$ stereoisomers.\n\nA meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry. Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50:50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.",

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

In 1858, the German chemist August KekulÃ© and the Scottish chemist Archibald Couper independently proposed that, in all organic compounds, carbon is tetravalent-it always forms four bonds when it joins other elements to form stable compounds. Furthermore, said KekulÃ©, carbon atoms can bond to one another to form extended chains of linked atoms. In 1865, KekulÃ© provided another major advance when he suggested that carbon chains can double back on themselves to form rings of atoms.\n\nAlthough Kekule and Couper were correct in describing the tetravalent nature of carbon, chemistry was still viewed in a two-dimensional way until 1874. In that year, the Dutch chemist Jacobus van't Hoff and French chemist Joseph Le Bel added a third dimension to our ideas about organic compounds when they proposed that the four bonds of carbon are not oriented randomly but have specific spatial directions. Van't Hoff went even further and suggested that the four atoms to which carbon is bonded sit at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, with carbon in the center.\n\nA representation of a tetrahedral carbon atom is shown in FIGURE 1.7.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

This violates Dalton's postulate that that atoms are not created during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed.\n2. This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4. Both are subatomic particles that reside in an atom's nucleus. Both have approximately the same mass. Protons are positively charged, whereas neutrons are uncharged.\n5. (a) The Rutherford atom has a small, positively charged nucleus, so most $\\alpha$ particles will pass through empty space far from the nucleus and be undeflected. Those $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will be deflected from their paths due to positive-positive repulsion. The more directly toward the nucleus the $\\alpha$ particles are headed, the larger the deflection angle will be. (b) Higher-energy $\\alpha$ particles that pass near the nucleus will still undergo deflection, but the faster they travel, the less the expected angle of deflection.\n(c) If the nucleus is smaller, the positive charge is smaller and the expected deflections are smaller-both in terms of how closely the $\\alpha$ particles pass by the nucleus undeflected and the angle of deflection. If the nucleus is larger, the positive charge is larger and the expected deflections are larger-more $\\alpha$ particles will be deflected, and the deflection angles will be larger.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

Oxyacids - \nMany compounds containing three or more elements (such as organic compounds or coordination compounds) are subject to specialized nomenclature rules that you will learn later. However, we will briefly\ndiscuss the important compounds known as oxyacids, compounds that contain hydrogen, oxygen, and at least one other element, and are bonded in such a way as to impart acidic properties to the compound (you will learn the details of this in a later chapter). Typical oxyacids consist of hydrogen combined with a polyatomic, oxygen-containing ion. To name oxyacids:\n\n1. Omit \"hydrogen\"\n2. Start with the root name of the anion\n3. Replace -ate with -ic, or -ite with -ous\n4. Add \"acid\"\n\nFor example, consider $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (which you might be tempted to call \"hydrogen carbonate\"). To name this correctly, \"hydrogen\" is omitted; the -ate of carbonate is replace with -ic; and acid is added-so its name is carbonic acid. Other examples are given in Table 4.9. There are some exceptions to the general naming method (e.g., $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ is called sulfuric acid, not sulfic acid, and $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ is sulfurous, not sulfous, acid).\n\nNames of Common Oxyacids\n\n| Formula | Anion Name | Acid Name |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $\\mathrm{HC}_{2} \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{2}$ | acetate | acetic acid |\n| $\\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ | nitrate | nitric acid |\n| $\\mathrm{HNO}_{2}$ | nitrite | nitrous acid |\n| $\\mathrm{HClO}_{4}$ | perchlorate | perchloric acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ | carbonate | carbonic acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ | sulfate | sulfuric acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ | sulfite | sulfurous acid |\n| $\\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{PO}_{4}$ | phosphate | phosphoric acid |",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

Polar bonds can also result from the interaction of functional groups with acids or bases. Take an alcohol such as methanol, for example. In neutral methanol, the carbon atom is somewhat electron-poor because the electronegative oxygen attracts the electrons in the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond. On protonation of the methanol oxygen by an acid, however, a full positive charge on oxygen attracts the electrons in the C-O bond much more strongly and makes the carbon much more electron-poor. We'll see numerous examples throughout this book of reactions that are catalyzed by acids because of the resultant increase in bond polarity upon protonation.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole.

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst.

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The branch attached to position 3 of our chain contains two carbon atoms (numbered in red)-so we take our name for two carbons eth- and attach $-y l$ at the end to signify we are describing a branch. Putting all the pieces together, this molecule is 3-ethylhexane.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Topics such as bond polarity, the acid-base behavior of molecules, and hydrogen-bonding are a particularly important part of that foundation.\n\nWe saw in the previous chapter how covalent bonds between atoms are described, and we looked at the valence\nbond model, which uses hybrid orbitals to account for the observed shapes of organic molecules. Before going on to a systematic study of organic chemistry, however, we still need to review a few fundamental topics. In particular, we need to look more closely at how electrons are distributed in covalent bonds and at some of the consequences that arise when the electrons in a bond are not shared equally between atoms.",

They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr .

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

Nucleophilic substitution and base-induced elimination are two of the most widely occurring and versatile reactions in organic chemistry, both in the laboratory and in biological pathways. We'll look at them closely in this chapter to see how they occur, what their characteristics are, and how they can be used. We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The subject can be a bit complex but is so important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.\n\nAn object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning \"handed.\" A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups-a so-called chirality center. Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either $\\boldsymbol{R}$ (rectus) or $\\boldsymbol{S}$ (sinister) by using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the direction of decreasing rank $(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the $R$ configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the $S$ configuration.\n\nSome molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound with $n$ chirality centers can have a maximum of $2^{n}$ stereoisomers.\n\nA meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry. Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50:50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

This statement violates Dalton's fourth postulate: In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each type (and thus also the percentage) always have the same ratio.\n3. Dalton originally thought that all atoms of a particular element had identical properties, including mass. Thus, the concept of isotopes, in which an element has different masses, was a violation of the original idea. To account for the existence of isotopes, the second postulate of his atomic theory was modified to state that atoms of the same element must have identical chemical properties.\n4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Could we \"app\" chemistry?\n\nIn a 2012 TED talk, Lee describes one fascinating possibility: combining a collection of chemical \"inks\" with a 3D printer capable of fabricating a reaction apparatus (tiny test tubes, beakers, and the like) to fashion a \"universal toolkit of chemistry.\" This toolkit could be used to create custom-tailored drugs to fight a new superbug or to \"print\" medicine personally configured to your genetic makeup, environment, and health situation.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons.

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

The subject can be a bit complex but is so important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.\n\nAn object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning \"handed.\" A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups-a so-called chirality center. Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either $\\boldsymbol{R}$ (rectus) or $\\boldsymbol{S}$ (sinister) by using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the direction of decreasing rank $(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the $R$ configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the $S$ configuration.\n\nSome molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound with $n$ chirality centers can have a maximum of $2^{n}$ stereoisomers.\n\nA meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry. Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50:50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand.

In 1858, the German chemist August KekulÃ© and the Scottish chemist Archibald Couper independently proposed that, in all organic compounds, carbon is tetravalent-it always forms four bonds when it joins other elements to form stable compounds. Furthermore, said KekulÃ©, carbon atoms can bond to one another to form extended chains of linked atoms. In 1865, KekulÃ© provided another major advance when he suggested that carbon chains can double back on themselves to form rings of atoms.\n\nAlthough Kekule and Couper were correct in describing the tetravalent nature of carbon, chemistry was still viewed in a two-dimensional way until 1874. In that year, the Dutch chemist Jacobus van't Hoff and French chemist Joseph Le Bel added a third dimension to our ideas about organic compounds when they proposed that the four bonds of carbon are not oriented randomly but have specific spatial directions. Van't Hoff went even further and suggested that the four atoms to which carbon is bonded sit at the corners of a regular tetrahedron, with carbon in the center.\n\nA representation of a tetrahedral carbon atom is shown in FIGURE 1.7. Note the conventions used to show threedimensionality: solid lines represent bonds in the plane of the page, the heavy wedged line represents a bond coming out of the page toward the viewer, and the dashed line represents a bond receding back behind the page, away from the viewer.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

The subject can be a bit complex but is so important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.\n\nAn object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning \"handed.\" A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups-a so-called chirality center. Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either $\\boldsymbol{R}$ (rectus) or $\\boldsymbol{S}$ (sinister) by using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the direction of decreasing rank $(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the $R$ configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the $S$ configuration.\n\nSome molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound with $n$ chirality centers can have a maximum of $2^{n}$ stereoisomers.\n\nA meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry. Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50:50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

The subject can be a bit complex but is so important that it's worthwhile spending time to become familiar with it.\n\nAn object or molecule that is not superimposable on its mirror image is said to be chiral, meaning \"handed.\" A chiral molecule is one that does not have a plane of symmetry cutting through it so that one half is a mirror image of the other half. The most common cause of chirality in organic molecules is the presence of a tetrahedral, $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups-a so-called chirality center. Chiral compounds can exist as a pair of nonsuperimposable mirror-image stereoisomers called enantiomers. Enantiomers are identical in all physical properties except for the direction in which they rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe stereochemical configuration of a chirality center can be specified as either $\\boldsymbol{R}$ (rectus) or $\\boldsymbol{S}$ (sinister) by using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules. First rank the four substituents on the chiral carbon atom, and then orient the molecule so that the lowest-ranked group points directly back. If a curved arrow drawn in the direction of decreasing rank $(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3)$ for the remaining three groups is clockwise, the chirality center has the $R$ configuration. If the direction is counterclockwise, the chirality center has the $S$ configuration.\n\nSome molecules have more than one chirality center. Enantiomers have opposite configuration at all chirality centers, whereas diastereomers have the same configuration in at least one center but opposite configurations at the others. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in configuration at only one chirality center. A compound with $n$ chirality centers can have a maximum of $2^{n}$ stereoisomers.\n\nA meso compound contains a chirality center but is achiral overall because it has a plane of symmetry. Racemic mixtures, or racemates, are 50:50 mixtures of (+) and (-) enantiomers. Racemates and individual diastereomers differ in their physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, and boiling point.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Ball-and-stick and space-filling models show the geometric arrangement of atoms in a molecule. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. A convenient amount unit for expressing very large numbers of atoms or molecules is the mole.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4. When one atom bonds to various atoms in a group, the bond strength typically decreases as we move down the group.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties.

Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Chemists use the scientific method to perform experiments, pose hypotheses, and formulate laws and develop theories, so that they can better understand the behavior of the natural world. To do so, they operate in the macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic domains. Chemists measure, analyze, purify, and synthesize a wide variety of substances that are important to our lives.",

Topics such as bond polarity, the acid-base behavior of molecules, and hydrogen-bonding are a particularly important part of that foundation.\n\nWe saw in the previous chapter how covalent bonds between atoms are described, and we looked at the valence\nbond model, which uses hybrid orbitals to account for the observed shapes of organic molecules.

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

Although the four $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{H}$ bonds are equivalent in the original molecule, they do not each require the same energy to break; once the first bond is broken (which requires $439 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ ), the remaining bonds are easier to break. The $415 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ value is the average, not the exact value required to break any one bond.\n\nThe strength of a bond between two atoms increases as the number of electron pairs in the bond increases. Generally, as the bond strength increases, the bond length decreases. Thus, we find that triple bonds are stronger and shorter than double bonds between the same two atoms; likewise, double bonds are stronger and shorter than single bonds between the same two atoms. Average bond energies for some common bonds appear in Table 9.3, and a comparison of bond lengths and bond strengths for some common bonds appears in\n\nTable 9.4.

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry. The subject can be a bit complex at first, but the material covered in this chapter nevertheless forms the basis for much of the remainder of the book.\n\nAre you right-handed or left-handed? You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas.

Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

To understand both organic and biological chemistry, it's necessary to know not just what occurs but also why and how chemical reactions take place. In this chapter, we've taken a brief look at the fundamental kinds of organic reactions, we've seen why reactions occur, and we've seen how reactions can be described.\n\nThere are four common kinds of reactions: addition reactions take place when two reactants add together to give a single product; elimination reactions take place when one reactant splits apart to give two products; substitution reactions take place when two reactants exchange parts to give two new products; and rearrangement reactions take place when one reactant undergoes a reorganization of bonds and atoms to give an isomeric product.\n\nA full description of how a reaction occurs is called its mechanism. There are two general kinds of mechanisms by which most reactions take place: radical mechanisms and polar mechanisms. Polar reactions, the more common type, occur because of an attractive interaction between a nucleophilic (electron-rich) site in one molecule and an electrophilic (electron-poor) site in another molecule. A bond is formed in a polar reaction when the nucleophile donates an electron pair to the electrophile. This transfer of electrons is indicated by a curved arrow showing the direction of electron travel from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Radical reactions involve species that have an odd number of electrons. A bond is formed when each reactant donates one\nelectron.",

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Let's look first at the kinds of reactions that take place. There are four general types of organic reactions: additions, eliminations, substitutions, and rearrangements.\n\n- Addition reactions occur when two reactants add together to form a single product with no atoms \"left over.\" An example that we'll be studying soon is the reaction of an alkene, such as ethylene, with HBr to yield an alkyl bromide.\n\n- Elimination reactions are, in a sense, the opposite of addition reactions. They occur when a single reactant splits into two products, often with the formation of a small molecule such as water or HBr . An example is the acid-catalyzed reaction of an alcohol to yield water and an alkene.",

We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

For clarity, all cyclohexane rings drawn in this book will have the front (lower) bond heavily shaded to indicate nearness to the viewer.\n\n\nIn addition to the chair conformation of cyclohexane, there is an alternative conformation of cyclohexane that bears a slight resemblance to a twisted boat. Called the twist-boat conformation, it is nearly free of angle strain. It does, however, have both steric strain and torsional strain and is about $23 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}(5.5 \\mathrm{kcal} / \\mathrm{mol})$ higher in\nenergy than the chair conformation. As a result, molecules adopt the twist-boat geometry only rarely.\n\n\n\nTwist-boat cyclohexane ( $23 \\mathrm{~kJ} / \\mathrm{mol}$ strain)",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

Now it's time to add a third dimension to our study. Stereochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the three-dimensional aspects of molecules. We'll see on many occasions in future chapters that the exact three-dimensional structure of a molecule is often crucial to determining its properties and biological behavior.\n\nWe know from Section 1.5 that $\\sigma$ bonds are cylindrically symmetrical. In other words, the intersection of a plane cutting through a carbon-carbon single-bond orbital looks like a circle. Because of this cylindrical symmetry, rotation is possible around carbon-carbon bonds in open-chain molecules. In ethane, for instance, rotation around the $\\mathrm{C}-\\mathrm{C}$ bond occurs freely, constantly changing the spatial relationships between the hydrogens on one carbon and those on the other (FIGURE 3.6).\n\n\nFIGURE 3.6 Rotation occurs around the carbon-carbon single bond in ethane because of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ bond cylindrical symmetry.\nThe different arrangements of atoms that result from bond rotation are called conformations, and molecules that have different arrangements are called conformational isomers, or conformers.

A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules.

By putting a few fundamental reactions together in the proper sequence, some remarkably useful transformations can be carried out. One such example is the Robinson annulation reaction for the synthesis of polycyclic molecules. The word annulation derives from the Latin annulus, meaning \"ring,\" so an annulation reaction is one that builds a new ring onto a molecule.\n\nNamed after Robert Robinson, a British chemist and 1947 Nobel Prize winner, the Robinson annulation is a two-step process that combines a Michael reaction with an intramolecular aldol reaction. It takes place between a nucleophilic donor, such as a $\\beta$-keto ester; an enamine, or a $\\beta$-diketone; and an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone acceptor, such as 3-buten-2-one. The product is a substituted 2 -cyclohexenone.\n\n\nThe first step of the Robinson annulation is simply a Michael reaction. An enamine or an enolate ion from a $\\beta$-keto ester or $\\beta$-diketone effects a conjugate addition to an $\\alpha, \\beta$-unsaturated ketone, yielding a 1,5 -diketone. But as we saw in Section 23.6, 1,5-diketones undergo intramolecular aldol condensation to yield cyclohexenones when treated with base. Thus, the final product contains a six-membered ring, and an annulation has been accomplished. One example of this occurs during a synthesis of the steroid hormone estrone (FIGURE 23.9).",

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",

There are many reasons for carrying out the laboratory synthesis of an organic compound. In the pharmaceutical industry, new molecules are designed and synthesized in the hope that some might be useful new drugs. In the chemical industry, syntheses are done to devise more economical routes to known compounds. In academic laboratories, the synthesis of extremely complex molecules is sometimes done just for the intellectual challenge involved in mastering so difficult a subject. The successful synthesis route is a highly creative work that is sometimes described by such subjective terms as elegant or beautiful.\n\nIn this book, too, we will often devise syntheses of molecules from simpler precursors, but the purpose here is to learn. The ability to plan a successful multistep synthetic sequence requires a working knowledge of the uses and limitations of many different organic reactions. Furthermore, it requires the practical ability to piece together the steps in a sequence such that each reaction does only what is desired without causing changes elsewhere in the molecule. Planning a synthesis makes you approach a chemical problem in a logical way, draw on your knowledge of chemical reactions, and organize that knowledge into a workable plan-it helps you learn organic chemistry.\n\nThere's no secret to planning an organic synthesis: all it takes is a knowledge of the different reactions and some practice. The only real trick is to work backward in what is often called a retrosynthetic direction. Don't look at a potential starting material and ask yourself what reactions it might undergo. Instead, look at the final product and ask, \"What was the immediate precursor of that product?\" For example, if the final product is an alkyl halide, the immediate precursor might be an alkene, to which you could add HX. If the final product is a cis alkene, the immediate precursor might be an alkyne, which you could hydrogenate using the Lindlar catalyst. Having found an immediate precursor, work backward again, one step at a time, until you get back to the starting material. You have to keep the starting material in mind, of course, so that you can work back to it, but you don't want that starting material to be your main focus.\n\nLet's work several examples of increasing complexity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

The electronic structure of an atom can be described by a quantum mechanical wave equation, in which electrons are considered to occupy orbitals around the nucleus. Different orbitals have different energy levels and different shapes. For example, $s$ orbitals are spherical and $p$ orbitals are dumbbell-shaped. The groundstate electron configuration of an atom can be found by assigning electrons to the proper orbitals, beginning with the lowest-energy ones.\n\nA covalent bond is formed when an electron pair is shared between atoms. According to valence bond (VB) theory, electron sharing occurs by the overlap of two atomic orbitals. According to molecular orbital (MO) theory, bonds result from the mathematical combination of atomic orbitals to give molecular orbitals, which belong to the entire molecule. Bonds that have a circular cross-section and are formed by head-on interaction are called sigma ( $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ ) bonds; bonds formed by sideways interaction of $p$ orbitals are called $\\mathbf{p i}$ ( $\\boldsymbol{\\pi}$ ) bonds.\n\nIn the valence bond description, carbon uses hybrid orbitals to form bonds in organic molecules. When forming only single bonds with tetrahedral geometry, carbon uses four equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{3}}$ hybrid orbitals. When forming a double bond with planar geometry, carbon uses three equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p}^{\\mathbf{2}}$ hybrid orbitals and one unhybridized $p$ orbital. When forming a triple bond with linear geometry, carbon uses two equivalent $\\boldsymbol{s p h}$ hybrid orbitals and two unhybridized $p$ orbitals. Other atoms such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and sulfur also use hybrid orbitals to form strong, oriented bonds.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions.

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

An overall description of how a reaction occurs is called a reaction mechanism. A mechanism describes in detail exactly what takes place at each stage of a chemical transformation-which bonds are broken and in what order, which bonds are formed and in what order, and what the relative rates are for each step. A complete mechanism must also account for all reactants used and all products formed.\n\nAll chemical reactions involve bond-breaking and bond-making. When two molecules come together, react, and yield products, specific bonds in the reactant molecules are broken and specific bonds in the product molecules are formed. Fundamentally, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can break. A bond can break in an electronically unsymmetrical way so that both bonding electrons remain with one product fragment, leaving the other with a vacant orbital, or a bond can break in an electronically symmetrical way so that one electron remains with each product fragment. The unsymmetrical cleavage is said to be heterolytic, and the symmetrical cleavage is said to be homolytic.\n\nWe'll develop this point in more detail later, but note for now that the movement of two electrons in the unsymmetrical process is indicated using a full-headed curved arrow ( $\\curvearrowright$ ), whereas the movement of one electron in the symmetrical process is indicated using a half-headed, or \"fishhook,\" arrow ( $\\AA$ ).\n\n\nJust as there are two ways in which a bond can break, there are two ways in which a covalent two-electron bond can form. A bond can form in an electronically unsymmetrical way if both bonding electrons are donated to the new bond by one reactant, or in a symmetrical way if one electron is donated by each reactant.\n\n\nProcesses that involve unsymmetrical bond-breaking and bond-making are called polar reactions. Polar reactions involve species that have an even number of electrons and thus have only electron pairs in their orbitals. Polar processes are by far the more common reaction type in both organic and biological chemistry, and a large part of this book is devoted to their description.",

In this chapter, we've reviewed some of the ways that chemists describe and account for chemical reactivity, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the specific reactions that will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nOrganic molecules often have polar covalent bonds as a result of unsymmetrical electron sharing caused by differences in the electronegativity of atoms. A carbon-oxygen bond is polar, for example, because oxygen attracts the shared electrons more strongly than carbon does. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are relatively nonpolar. Many molecules as a whole are also polar, owing to the presence of individual polar bonds and electron lone pairs. The polarity of a molecule is measured by its dipole moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nPlus (+) and minus (-) signs are often used to indicate the presence of formal charges on atoms in molecules. Assigning formal charges to specific atoms is a bookkeeping technique that makes it possible to keep track of the valence electrons around an atom and offers some clues about chemical reactivity.",

These molecular compounds (covalent compounds) result when atoms share, rather than transfer (gain or lose), electrons. Covalent bonding is an important and extensive concept in chemistry, and it will be treated in considerable detail in a later chapter of this text. We can often identify molecular compounds on the basis of their physical properties. Under normal conditions, molecular compounds often exist as gases, low-boiling liquids, and low-melting solids, although many important exceptions exist.\n\nWhereas ionic compounds are usually formed when a metal and a nonmetal combine, covalent compounds are usually formed by a combination of nonmetals. Thus, the periodic table can help us recognize many of the compounds that are covalent. While we can use the positions of a compound's elements in the periodic table to predict whether it is ionic or covalent at this point in our study of chemistry, you should be aware that this is a very simplistic approach that does not account for a number of interesting exceptions. Shades of gray exist between ionic and molecular compounds, and you'll learn more about those later.",

The group of organic compounds called alkanes are simple and relatively unreactive, but they nevertheless provide a useful vehicle for introducing some important general ideas. In this chapter, we'll use alkanes to introduce the basic approach to naming organic compounds and to take an initial look at some of the three-dimensional aspects of molecules, a topic of particular importance in understanding biological organic chemistry.\n\nAccording to Chemical Abstracts, the publication that abstracts and indexes the chemical literature, there are more than 195 million known organic compounds. Each of these compounds has its own physical properties, such as melting point and boiling point, and each has its own chemical reactivity.\n\nChemists have learned through years of experience that organic compounds can be classified into families according to their structural features and that the members of a given family have similar chemical behavior. Instead of 195 million compounds with random reactivity, there are a few dozen families of organic compounds whose chemistry is reasonably predictable. We'll study the chemistry of specific families throughout much of this book, beginning in this chapter with a look at the simplest family, the alkanes.",

We'll begin with substitution reactions.\n\nWe saw in the preceding chapter that the carbon-halogen bond in an alkyl halide is polar and that the carbon atom is electron-poor. Thus, alkyl halides are electrophiles, and much of their chemistry involves polar reactions with nucleophiles and bases. Alkyl halides do one of two things when they react with a nucleophile/ base such as hydroxide ion: they either undergo substitution of the X group by the nucleophile, or they undergo\nelimination of HX to yield an alkene.\n\n\nElimination",

Understanding the causes and consequences of molecular handedness is crucial to understanding organic and biological chemistry.

You may not spend much time thinking about it, but handedness plays a surprisingly large role in your daily activities. Many musical instruments, such as oboes and clarinets, have a handedness to them; the last available softball glove always fits the wrong hand. The reason for these difficulties is that our hands aren't identical; rather, they're mirror images. When you hold a left hand up to a mirror, the image you see looks like a right hand. Try it.\n\n\nLeft hand\n\n\nRight hand\n\nHandedness is also important in organic and biological chemistry, where it arises primarily as a consequence of the tetrahedral stereochemistry of $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon atoms. Many drugs and almost all the molecules in our bodies-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and many more-have a handedness. Furthermore, molecular handedness enables the precise interactions between enzymes and their substrates that are involved in the hundreds of thousands of chemical reactions on which life is based.",
