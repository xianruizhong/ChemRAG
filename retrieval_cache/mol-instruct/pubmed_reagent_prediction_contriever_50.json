On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2. Its characterization is discussed along with a possible mechanism for formation and decomposition reactions.",

Theoretical work suggests that reactions (R1b) and (R1c) may be a general feature of acyl peroxy and α-carbonyl peroxy radicals. In this work, branching ratios for R1a-R1c were derived for six carbonyl-containing peroxy radicals: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), and CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO.

Two different experimental arrangements have been used. Arrangement A consisted of a laser-flash photolysis set up combined with quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and allowed the determination of the stable products at 4 mbar. The c-C5H9 radicals were produced via the reaction c-C5H10 + Cl with chlorine atoms from the photolysis of CFCl3; the O atoms were generated by photolysis of SO2. Arrangement B, a conventional discharge flow-reactor with molecular beam sampling, was used to determine the rate coefficient. Here, the hydrocarbon radicals (c-C5H9, C2H5, CH2OCH3) were produced via the reaction of atomic fluorine with c-C5H10, C2H6, and CH3OCH3, respectively, and detected by mass spectrometry after laser photoionization. For the c-C5H9 + O reaction, the relative contributions of intermediate formation (c-C5H9O) and direct abstraction (c-C5H8 + OH) were found to be 68 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 4%, respectively. The decomposition products of the chemically activated intermediate could be identified, and the following relative branching fractions were obtained: c-C5H8O + H (31 +/- 2%), CH2CH(CH2)2CHO + H (40 +/- 5%), 2 C2H4 + H + CO (17 +/- 5%), and C3H4O + C2H4 + H (12 +/- 5%). Additionally, the product formation of the c-C5H8 + O reaction was studied, and the following relative yields were obtained (mol %): C2H4, 24%; C3H4O, 18%; c-C5H8O, 30%; c-C5H8O, 23%; 4-pentenal, 5%. The rate coefficient of the c-C5H9 + O reaction was determined relative to the reactions C2H5 + O and CH3OCH2 + O leading to k = (1.73 +/- 0.05) x 10(14) cm3 mol(-1) s(-1). The experimental branching fractions are analyzed in terms of statistical rate theory with molecular and transition-state data from quantum chemical calculations, and high-pressure limiting Arrhenius parameters for the unimolecular decomposition reactions of C5H9O species are derived.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

Our study indicates that spin-forbidden reactions are the probable pathways in the reactions with N atoms, whereas spin-allowed reactions are the dominant processes in the reactions with O atoms. The major factor influencing the reaction rate constants of anions with N and O atoms is whether a spin-allowed barrierless pathway exists.

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

The OCMCS with 100 carboxymethyl groups and 75 amino groups per 100 anhydroglucosamine units of OCMCS was synthesized by the reaction of chitosan and monochloroacetic. When OCMCS was dissolved in water, its solution was neutral and OCMCS behaved like a weak polyanionic polyeclectrolyte because most of carboxylic groups were not dissociated in neutral aqueous solution. The aggregation behavior of OCMCS in aqueous solution was studied by surface tensiometry, steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy and viscometry. The critical aggregation concentration (cac) of OCMCS was determined to be between 0.042 mg/ml and 0.050 mg/ml. The possible aggregation mechanism of OCMCS in water was elucidated.",

A joint experimental and theoretical study (energies calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory) suggests that the neutral radical CCC(O)Ph rearranges via a four-centred ipso radical cyclisation/ring opening to form the isomer PhCCCO in an exothermic reaction. (13)C labelling confirms that the rearrangement does not involve O migration. Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

Thirty-eight percent (18/48) of the OCSCCs exhibited a mutation in exons 5-9 of the p53 gene. There was a significantly higher incidence of p53 mutations in OCSCCs from tobacco users (predominantly cigarette smokers) compared to those who had never used tobacco. No increase in the incidence of p53 mutation was observed in tobacco users who drank alcohol. G to A transitions and deletions were the predominant mutations observed in OCSCCs from tobacco users. No specific pattern of mutation was observed in OCSCCs from those subjects who had never used tobacco. These data suggest that a history of tobacco use was associated with a high incidence of p53 mutations in patients with OCSCC and that tobacco carcinogens include a specific pattern of mutations in oral cavity tissue in vivo.",

Specificity of the antibody produced was examined with structurally related synthetic saccharides using the enzyme immunoassay technique. The presence of a glycosyl group at 0-6 of either the Gal or the GalNAc residue of the disaccharide Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc did not prevent binding of the antisera to the saccharide moiety. However, the antisera did not bind either the trisaccharide moiety NeuAc2----3 Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc alpha 1----OC6H4NO2 (o) or GlcNAc beta 1----3 Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc alpha OBn. These observations indicate that antibody approach to the antigen is to the 0-3 side of the terminal galactose in the disaccharide Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc. We have also observed that the antibody prefers Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc alpha 1----to Gal beta 1----3 GalNAc beta 1----disaccharide derivatives in its binding capacity. The antibody was found to bind natural T antigen present on neuraminidase-treated red blood cells and, by immunohistochemical analysis, it was found to bind to naturally occurring T antigen on breast tumor cells.",

Two different experimental arrangements have been used. Arrangement A consisted of a laser-flash photolysis set up combined with quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and allowed the determination of the stable products at 4 mbar. The c-C5H9 radicals were produced via the reaction c-C5H10 + Cl with chlorine atoms from the photolysis of CFCl3; the O atoms were generated by photolysis of SO2. Arrangement B, a conventional discharge flow-reactor with molecular beam sampling, was used to determine the rate coefficient. Here, the hydrocarbon radicals (c-C5H9, C2H5, CH2OCH3) were produced via the reaction of atomic fluorine with c-C5H10, C2H6, and CH3OCH3, respectively, and detected by mass spectrometry after laser photoionization. For the c-C5H9 + O reaction, the relative contributions of intermediate formation (c-C5H9O) and direct abstraction (c-C5H8 + OH) were found to be 68 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 4%, respectively. The decomposition products of the chemically activated intermediate could be identified, and the following relative branching fractions were obtained: c-C5H8O + H (31 +/- 2%), CH2CH(CH2)2CHO + H (40 +/- 5%), 2 C2H4 + H + CO (17 +/- 5%), and C3H4O + C2H4 + H (12 +/- 5%). Additionally, the product formation of the c-C5H8 + O reaction was studied, and the following relative yields were obtained (mol %): C2H4, 24%; C3H4O, 18%; c-C5H8O, 30%; c-C5H8O, 23%; 4-pentenal, 5%. The rate coefficient of the c-C5H9 + O reaction was determined relative to the reactions C2H5 + O and CH3OCH2 + O leading to k = (1.73 +/- 0.05) x 10(14) cm3 mol(-1) s(-1). The experimental branching fractions are analyzed in terms of statistical rate theory with molecular and transition-state data from quantum chemical calculations, and high-pressure limiting Arrhenius parameters for the unimolecular decomposition reactions of C5H9O species are derived.",

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons. The crystal structures of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), p-ClC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) and p-BrC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) were determined by X-ray crystallography using single crystals.

Isolation of bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and identification of bis(trifluoromethyl)trioxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3.\nThe synthesis of CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 is accomplished by the photolysis of a mixture of (CF3CO)2O, CO, and O2. Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2.

Uniquely, [(o-O2C6Cl4){(PhO)3P}(OC)2Ru(micro-CN)Ru(CO)2(PPh3)(o-O2C6Cl4)]- is oxidised first at the N-bound fragment, indicating that it is possible to control the site of electron transfer by tuning the co-ligands. Crystallisation of [(o-O2C6Cl4)(Ph3P)(OC)2Ru(micro-CN)Ru(CO)2{P(OPh)3}(o-O2C6Cl4)] resulted in the formation of an isomer in which the P(OPh)3 ligand is cis to the cyanide bridge, contrasting with the trans arrangement of the X-Ru-L fragment in all other complexes of the type RuX(CO)2L(o-O2C6Cl4).",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless. The decomposition and isomerization of some intermediates were also modeled at the QCISD(T)/6-311+G(2df)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d) level for the better understanding of the O((1)D) with CF(3)CN chemistry. The decomposition products CF(3) and NCO arising from CF(3)OCN and CF(3)NCO are the dominant species. Further comparison with similar reactions is also summarized.",

We recently identified a potential binding site for CycN on the surface of NicA2 through rigid body docking [<iJ. Biol. Chem</i. <b2022</b, <i298</i (8), 102251]. However, this potential binding interface has not been experimentally validated. In this paper, we used unnatural amino acid incorporation to probe the binding interface between NicA2 and CycN. Our results are consistent with a structural model of the NicA2-CycN complex predicted by protein-protein docking and AlphaFold, suggesting that this is the binding site for CycN on NicA2's surface. Based on additional mutagenesis of potentially redox active residues in NicA2, we propose that electron transfer from NicA2's flavin to CycN's heme occurs without the assistance of a protein-derived wire.",

An ab initio study at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory indicates that (i) triplet NCCCCCN is the ground state with a T/S energy gap of -14.9 kcal mol(-1); (ii) the structures of triplet and singlet NCCCCCN need to be described by molecular obital theory, and a simple valence bond approach cannot be used for this system; and (iii) there are several possible routes by which an energized neutral may lose carbon, but the major route involves the triplet nitrile to isonitrile rearrangement NCCCCCN --&gt; CNCCCCN --&gt; NCCCCN + C.",

Recent calculations on the C(2)H(3)N(+*) potential energy surface have suggested that it may be difficult to generate pure CH(3)CN(+*) when ionizing acetonitrile. We have probed the interconversion of CH(3)CN(+*) and its lower energy isomer CH(2)CNH(+*) by calculation, collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry and ion-molecule reaction. The latter ion, ionized ketenimine, is co-generated upon electron or chemical ionization of neutral acetonitrile in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. An estimate of the ratio of the two isomers can be obtained from their respective ion-molecule reactions with CO(2) or COS. CH(3)CN(+*) reacts by proton-transfer with CO(2) and charge transfer with COS, whereas CH(2)CNH(+*) is unreactive.",

From the theoretical aspects, a new pathway via isomerization transition state (TS) at 391 ± 8 kJ∕mol is found leading to the CO + CH3NC products. An amount of 60% reactant molecules at 300 K is estimated to successfully surpass the average TS barrier lying above the excitation energy by 3.5 kJ∕mol. Further, a prior distribution method is conducted to characterize the vibrational energy distribution of CO on a statistical basis. The pathway to CH3NC + CO yields a vibrational branching ratio (v = 0:v = 1:v = 2:v = 3∼0.63:0.25:0.093:0.032) in excellent agreement with the observation (0.62:0.25:0.09:0.05). ",

The following branching ratios were determined: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.35 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0.25 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.4 ± 0.1; C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.24 ± 0.15, Y(R1b) = 0.29 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.47 ± 0.15; CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.75 ± 0.13, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.25 ± 0.13; CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.42 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.58 ± 0.1; CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO, Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.2, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2; and CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2.

After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2.

Although this reaction is typically assumed to form hydroperoxides as the major products (R1a), acetyl peroxy radicals and acetonyl peroxy radicals have been shown to undergo other reactions (R1b) and (R1c) with substantial branching ratios: RO(2) + HO(2) → ROOH + O(2) (R1a), RO(2) + HO(2) → ROH + O(3) (R1b), RO(2) + HO(2) → RO + OH + O(2) (R1c). Theoretical work suggests that reactions (R1b) and (R1c) may be a general feature of acyl peroxy and α-carbonyl peroxy radicals. In this work, branching ratios for R1a-R1c were derived for six carbonyl-containing peroxy radicals: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), and CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO. Branching ratios for reactions of Cl-atoms with butanal, butanone, methacrolein, and methyl vinyl ketone were also measured as a part of this work. Product yields were determined using a combination of long path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The following branching ratios were determined: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.35 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0.25 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.4 ± 0.1; C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.24 ± 0.15, Y(R1b) = 0.29 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.47 ± 0.15; CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.75 ± 0.13, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.25 ± 0.13; CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.42 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.58 ± 0.1; CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO, Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.2, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2; and CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2.

Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2.

Rupture of the O-O bond was shown to be the rate-determining step for both peroxides, and bond energies of 29 +/- 1 and 34.0 +/- 0.7 kcal mol(-1) were obtained for CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)F and CF(3)OC(O)OOCF(3). The heat of formation of the CF(3)OCO(2)(*) radical, which is a common product formed in both decompositions, was calculated by ab initio methods as -229 +/- 4 kcal mol(-1). With this value, the heat of formation of the title species and of CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)OCF(3) could in turn be obtained as Delta(f) degrees (CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)F) = -286 +/- 6 kcal mol(-1), Delta(f) degrees (CF(3)OC(O)OOCF(3)) = -341 +/- 6 kcal mol(-1), and Delta(f) degrees (CF(3)OC(O)OOC(O)OCF(3)) = -430 +/- 6 kcal mol(-1).",

This nonheme Co(III) complex catalyzes olefin epoxidation upon treatment with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It is proposed that complex 1 shows partitioning between the heterolytic and homolytic cleavage of an O-O bond to afford Co(V)=O (3) and Co(IV)=O (4) intermediates, proposed to be responsible for the stereospecific olefin epoxidation and radical-type oxidations, respectively. Moreover, under extreme conditions, in which the concentration of an active substrate is very high, the Co-OOC(O)R (2) species is a possible reactive species for epoxidation. Furthermore, partitioning between heterolysis and homolysis of the O-O bond of the intermediate 2 might be very sensitive to the nature of the solvent, and the O-O bond of the Co-OOC(O)R species might proceed predominantly by heterolytic cleavage, even in the presence of small amounts of protic solvent, to produce a discrete Co(V) O intermediate as the dominant reactive species. Evidence for these multiple active oxidants was derived from product analysis, the use of peroxyphenylacetic acid as the peracid, and EPR measurements. The results suggest that a less accessible Co(V)=O moiety can form in a system in which the supporting chelate ligand comprises a mixture of neutral and anionic nitrogen donors.",

The crystal structures of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), p-ClC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) and p-BrC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) were determined by X-ray crystallography using single crystals. The coordination around the phosphorus center in these compounds is best described as distorted tetrahedral and the P(O) and C(O) groups are anti with respect to each other. In the compound Br-C(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) (with two independent molecules in the unit cell), two conformers are connected to each other via two different N-H...O hydrogen bonds forming a non-centrosymmetric dimer. In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

The possible forms and structures of Zn species in the ionic liquids were analyzed according to the coordination number.

These lines are assigned to C=O stretching and mixed stretching modes of ONCO, based on results of 15N-, 13C-, and 18O-isotopic experiments and quantum-chemical calculations. These calculations using density-functional theory (B3LYP and PW91PW91/aug-cc-pVTZ) predict five stable isomers of NCO2: ONCO, NCOO, N-cyc-CO2, CNOO, and cyc-CNOO, listed in order of increasing energy. According to B3LYP calculations, ONCO has a trans configuration, with bond angles of angleONC approximately 136.3 degrees and angleNOC approximately 160.7 degrees. Calculated vibrational wave numbers, IR intensities, 15N-, 13C-, and 18O-isotopic shifts for ONCO agree satisfactorily with experimental results. ONCO was formed from reaction of CO with NO in its excited state.",

The new trioxide is obtained from the gas-phase photolytic reaction of CF(3)C(O)OC(O)CF(3) and FC(O)C(O)F at 223-228 K. It is a very thermally labile molecule that decomposes at room temperature by rupture of either of the CF(3)OC(O)O-O-OC(O)F bonds. These bonds are nonequivalent, and a branching ratio of 0.8 for fragmentation through the CF(3)OC(O)OO-OC(O)F bond was obtained. Unambiguous identification was possible through reaction of the trioxide with an excess of NO(2). Potential-energy surfaces (PES) of the different rotamers were studied by the B3LYP/6-311+G* method, and analysis of the IR frequency of the possible mixture of rotamers agrees excellently with the experimental IR spectrum. This molecule is the first nonsymmetric acyl trioxide reported in the literature.",

The reaction of equimolar amounts of HOCl with cystine at pH 11.3 does not yield N-chlorocystine [NCC = (-O2C)(H3N+)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NHCl)(CO(2)H)] but rather a 1:1 mixture of NDC and cystine. This result could be explained by two mechanisms: rapid disproportionation of NCC to produce NDC and cystine or a faster reaction of the second equivalent of HOCl with NCC than the first equivalent of HOCl reacts with cystine. The latter mechanism is favored because of our observation by NMR spectroscopy that NDC decomposes via a species that we have assigned as NCC. Thus, disproportionation of NCC is apparently a relatively slow process. The rates of reaction of cystine(0) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](2) degrees , cystine(1-) = [((-)O(2)C)(H(2)N)CHCH(2)SSCH(2)CH(NH(3)(+))(CO(2)(-))](-), and cystine(2-) = [-SCH(2)CH(NH2)(CO2)(-))]2(2-) have been investigated, and it is clear that cystine(0) is unreactive, whereas cystine(2-) is about four times more reactive than cystine(1-). Accordingly, the following mechanism is proposed (constants for 5 degrees C): HOCl = H+ + OCl-, pK1 = 7.47; cystine(0) = cystine(1-) + H+, pK2 = 8.15; cystine(1-) = cystine(2-) + H+, pK3 = 9.00; cystine(1-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(1-) + H2O, k4 = 4.3(2) x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1); cystine(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NCC(2)(-) + H2O, k5 = 1.6(2) x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1); NCC(1-) --&gt; NCC(2-) + H+, k6 = fast; NCC(2-) + HOCl --&gt; NDC(2-) + H2O, k7 = fast. At physiologic pH, the k4 pathway dominates. The generation of long-lived chloramine derivatives of cystine may have physiological consequences, since such compounds are known to react with nucleophiles via mechanisms that are also characteristic of HOCl, electrophilic transfer C+.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

Therefore, some of the methods need additional reexamination. This paper reinvestigates some chromatographic systems (thin-layer chromatography, paper chromatography, electrophoresis) most widely used in the analysis of minor bases occurring in nucleic acids according to their ability to separate m4C and m5C. A simple procedure for the preparation of the sample and a chromatographic system for its analysis was developed. The recommended chromatographic systems may be used for the simultaneous separation of not only of m4C and m5C but also both methylated cytosines together with N6-methyladenine and 7-methylguanine.",

We have used picosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to directly monitor the photolysis of Re(Cp*)(CO)3 in scCH4 and demonstrated that the initially generated Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH4) forms an equilibrium mixture of Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH4)/Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH3)H within the first few nanoseconds (tau = 2 ns).

For a real water exchange reaction to occur two different transition states have to be included, otherwise only an apparent water exchange reaction takes place. For the water exchange reaction in [Zn(H(2)O)(4)(L)](2+)·2H(2)O, nearly iso-energetic cis- and trans-orientated transition states are crossed. The gas-phase proton affinity of L shows instructive correlations with structural parameters and energy gaps for the investigated reactions.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

Isolation of bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and identification of bis(trifluoromethyl)trioxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3.\nThe synthesis of CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 is accomplished by the photolysis of a mixture of (CF3CO)2O, CO, and O2. Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2.

In some experiments, isotopically labeled (18)O2, (15)N(18)O and C2D6 reagents were included into the photolysis mixture in order to suppress and/or isotopically label possible secondary reactions. HCN, OC(18)O, C(18)O, NCO, DCN, and NH molecules were detected upon laser photolysis of HCNO/reagents/buffer gas mixtures.

We have investigated the products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 3-hexene-2,5-dione in the presence of NO at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of air using in situ atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2. Our observation of a molecular weight 102 species indicates that the CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 radical dominantly decomposes to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO plus CH3(*C)O, rather than decomposing to CH3C(O)CHO plus CH3C(O)(*C)HOH, isomerizing, or reacting with O2.

Complex 1 is a discrete, centrosymmetric dimer in which two vanadium atoms are bridged by two methoxide ligands. Compound 2 contains a V(4)O(4) eight-membered ring with both &amp;mgr;-oxo and &amp;mgr;-alkoxo bridging ligands; the ring is capped above and below by two triply bridging methoxo ligands. Compound 3 has the same structure as 2. The three vanadium atoms in complex 5 are linked by four bridging oxygen atoms from two tridentate thme(3)(-) ligands to form a V(3)O(4) chain in which V-O bonds alternate in length. The V-O(isopropoxo) bond in 6 is cis to V=O, and the V-O(acac) bond trans to the oxo group is relatively long. The V(2)O(2) rings of complex 1 and the mononuclear 1:2 complex can be considered to be the basic building block of the trinuclear complexes 4 and 5 and the tetranuclear complex 2, acting to extend the vanadium-oxide framework. (51)V and (1)H NMR spectroscopic studies of the solution state of complexes 1-6 revealed dramatic differences in structural and hydrolytic stability of these complexes. Compounds 1 and 3 only remained intact at low temperature in CDCl(3) solution, whereas the mononuclear compound 6 could remain at ambient temperature for approximately 10 h. Compound 4 only maintained its solid-state structure at low temperature in CDCl(3) solution, whereas compound 5 was significantly more stable. The structural integrity of oligomeric vanadium-oxygen frameworks increased significantly when the coordinating alkoxide group showed more resistance to exchange reactions than the methoxide group. The solid state and solution properties of this new group of complexes not only testify to the versatility of VO(2)(acac) as a vanadium(V) precursor but also raise questions relating to solution structure and properties of related vanadium complexes with insulin-mimetic properties and catalytic properties.",

The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method.

The rate constants of the NCCO + CH(4) and NCCO + C(2)H(4) reactions were also measured, obtaining upper limits of k (NCCO + CH(4)) ≤ 7.0 × 10(-14) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) and k (NCCO + C(2)H(4)) ≤ 5.0 × 10(-15) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1).

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

The results indicate that strong hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl chains assisted by strong electrostatic attractions between the headgroups and hydrogen bonds between the spacers lead to the formation of less surface active premicellar aggregates in bulk solution, resulting in the increase of CMC. If these interactions are weakened or inhibited, less surface active premicellar aggregates are no longer formed in the mixtures, and thus the CMC values are reduced. The work reveals that the combination of two surfactants with great self-assembling ability separately may have strong intermolecular binding interactions; however, their mixtures do not always generate superior synergism properties. Only moderate intermolecular interaction can generate the strongest synergism in CMC reduction.",

The calculated rate coefficients for the formation of OCS + S ((3)P) and CO + S(2) ((3)Σ(-)(g)) are much lower than k(SO + CS); hence, it is predicted that these two product channels do not contribute significantly to the overall rate coefficient.",

We have investigated the products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 3-hexene-2,5-dione in the presence of NO at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of air using in situ atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2. Our observation of a molecular weight 102 species indicates that the CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 radical dominantly decomposes to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO plus CH3(*C)O, rather than decomposing to CH3C(O)CHO plus CH3C(O)(*C)HOH, isomerizing, or reacting with O2.

Cl atom rate coefficients for reaction with n-CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]CH(CH2)3CN and n-CH2[double bond, length as m-dash]CH(CH2)4CN were determined as (2.95 ± 0.58) × 10-10 and (3.73 ± 0.60) × 10-10 cm3 molecule-1 s-1, respectively. CCl3COCl requires UV-C irradiation, so not all molecules are feasible for use in e.g. relative rate studies. Furthermore, it is recommended to perform experiments with O2 present, as this minimizes IR feature disturbance from product formation.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15).

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

Gas-phase CH(3)CO radicals were produced using several methods including: (1) 248 nm pulsed laser photolysis of acetone (CH(3)C(O)CH(3)), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK, CH(3)C(O)CH(2)CH(3)), and biacetyl (CH(3)C(O)C(O)CH(3)), (2) Cl + CH(3)C(O)H --&gt; CH(3)C(O) + HCl with Cl atoms produced via pulsed laser photolysis or in a discharge flow tube, and (3) OH + CH(3)C(O)H --&gt; CH(3)CO + H(2)O with two different pulsed laser photolysis sources of OH radicals. The CH(3)CO absorption spectrum was assigned on the basis of the consistency of the spectra obtained from the different CH(3)CO sources and agreement of the measured rate coefficients for the reaction of the absorbing species with O(2) and O(3) with literature values for the CH(3)CO + O(2) + M and CH(3)CO + O(3) reactions. The CH(3)CO absorption spectrum between 490 and 660 nm has a broad peak centered near 535 nm and shows no discernible structure. The absorption cross section of CH(3)CO at 532 nm was measured to be (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10(-19) cm(2) molecule(-1) (base e).",

Carbon monoxide products formed in the competing reaction and subsequent secondary chemistry were detected as a function of reagent ICN pressure to obtain total rate constants for the O + ICN reaction. Analysis of the experimental data yields rate constants of k(1) = (3.7 ± 1.0 to 26.2 ± 4.0) × 10(-14) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) over the total pressure range 1.5-9.5 Torr. Product channel NCO + I, the only bimolecular exothermic channel of the reaction, was investigated by detection of N(2)O in the presence of NO and found to be insignificant. An ab initio calculation of the potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction at the CCSD(T)/CEP-31G//DFT-B3LYP/CEP-31G level of theory was also performed. The pathways leading to bimolecular product channels are kinetically unfavorable.

In this report, a combined experimental and computational study is presented, which provides mechanistic understanding of the unprecedented oxidative coupling of NHCs at Cu. The presence of Cu(I) -, Cu(II) -, and Cu(III) -NHC complexes during the process is postulated, with the unusual Ccarbene -Ccarbene oxidative coupling reaction occurring under extremely mild reaction conditions. This process may represent a novel pathway for the decomposition of Cu-NHC complexes. ",

An ab initio study at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(3df) level of theory indicates that (i) triplet NCCCCCN is the ground state with a T/S energy gap of -14.9 kcal mol(-1); (ii) the structures of triplet and singlet NCCCCCN need to be described by molecular obital theory, and a simple valence bond approach cannot be used for this system; and (iii) there are several possible routes by which an energized neutral may lose carbon, but the major route involves the triplet nitrile to isonitrile rearrangement NCCCCCN --&gt; CNCCCCN --&gt; NCCCCN + C.",

Arrangement A consisted of a laser-flash photolysis set up combined with quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and allowed the determination of the stable products at 4 mbar. The c-C5H9 radicals were produced via the reaction c-C5H10 + Cl with chlorine atoms from the photolysis of CFCl3; the O atoms were generated by photolysis of SO2.

Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

The base-promoted eliminations from 1 proceeded by the E2 mechanism when Y = Cl, CF3, and NO2. The mechanism changed to the competing E2 and E1cb mechanisms by the poorer leaving groups (Y = H, OMe) and to the E1cb extreme by the strongly electron-withdrawing beta-aryl group (2, X = NO2). The values of beta = 0.14 and beta(lg) = 0.10-0.21 calculated for elimination from 1 (Y = NO2) indicate a reactant-like transition state with small extents of proton transfer and C(alpha)-OAr bond cleavage. The extent of proton transfer increased with a poorer leaving group, and the degree of leaving group bond cleavage increased with a weaker base. Also, the changes in the k(1) and k(-1)/k(2) values with the reactant structure variation are consistent with the E1cb mechanism. From these results, a plausible pathway of the change of the mechanism from E2 to the E1cb extreme is proposed.",

In agreement with the experimental results, the dominant channel for this reaction is H2CN+H. The theoretically estimated rate coefficient for the overall process at 298 K is 9.1 x 10(-12) cm3 s(-1) molecule(-1), which is nearly 1 order of magnitude lower than the experimental result, but also much larger than those computed for the reactions of ground-state nitrogen atoms with halomethyl radicals. The analysis of the singlet potential energy surface, and the corresponding computational kinetic study, shows that for the reaction of excited nitrogen atoms with methyl radicals, the preferred product from the kinetic point of view is also H2CN+H, but in this case production of HCN is significant (with branching ratios around 0.185). According to our calculations, spin-forbidden processes are highly unlikely for the N(4S) + CH3 reaction.

In the case of the Cu + CO2 reaction, the insertion route into the CO bond is also found direct but with a lower endothermicity (30.6 kcal/mol) and smaller activation energy (61.1 kcal/mol) than that into the CO bond of OCS. In all cases, the insertion mechanism proceeds simultaneously with electron transfer from the Cu atom to OCS (or CO2) molecule.",

Subsequent methyl ester hydrolysis provides thiosialosides (eg. 6 and 14) which are suitable for studies involving the use of sialic acid-recognising proteins.",

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

Theoretical work suggests that reactions (R1b) and (R1c) may be a general feature of acyl peroxy and α-carbonyl peroxy radicals.

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

Isolation of bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and identification of bis(trifluoromethyl)trioxydicarbonate, CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3.\nThe synthesis of CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, and CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 is accomplished by the photolysis of a mixture of (CF3CO)2O, CO, and O2. Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2. Its characterization is discussed along with a possible mechanism for formation and decomposition reactions.",

The UV-vis spectra of 7-24 revealed standard absorption spectra for the Ln cations. Representative compounds were used to generate nanoparticles from an established 1,4-butanediol-based solution precipitation route. The nanoproducts isolated adopted either a mixed zincite/lanthanum oxide (18n or 22n) or pure zincite (8n or 10n) phase dependent on NO(3) or OBc moiety. Fluorescence was not observed for any of these nanomaterials possibly due to phase separation, low crystallinity, surface traps, and/or quenching based on elevated Ln cation content.",

The chelated bicarbonate complex [Co(trpyn)(O2COH)]ZnCl(4).3H2O is isolated as a crystalline solid from an acidic solution of the parent carbonate [Co(trpyn)(O2CO)]ClO4, and X-ray structural analysis shows that lengthening of the C=Oexo bond and shortening of the C-Oendo bond accompanies protonation. The bimetallic complex [Co(Me-tpa)O2COZnCl3] results from the unexpected coordination of ZnCl3- to the exo O atom of a chelated carbonate ligand. This complex is obtained from both acidic and neutral solutions in which [Zn2+]=1.0 M, while the structurally similar complex [Co(pmea)O2COZnCl3].H2O is isolated from an analogous neutral solution.

The Zn-O bond lengths in all three complexes are indicative of bonds of significant strength. DFT calculations show that the nature of the bonding interaction between the Co(III) ion and the endo O atoms of the carbonate ligand remain essentially unaffected by coordination of Zn2+ to the exo O atom.

HCN, HCCN, and NO reaction products were directly detected.

Several other possible secondary reactions were also investigated and found to be very slow. The resulting product branching fractions of φ(1a) = 0.98 ± 0.07 for NO + HCCN and φ(1b) ≤ 0.07 for HCN + NCO, respectively, were obtained at 298 K. The potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction was calculated by ab initio methods at several levels of coupled-cluster theory. The calculations show pathways to channels (1a) and (1b) with nearly identical energetics and a substantial dependence on the level of theory used, suggesting that multireference calculations are needed to accurately predict the experimental results.",

We have investigated the products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 3-hexene-2,5-dione in the presence of NO at room temperature and atmospheric pressure of air using in situ atmospheric pressure ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Products of molecular weight 102 and 191 were identified and from consideration of the potential reactions these are attributed to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO and CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3, respectively. After initial addition of the OH radical, the CH3C(O)CH(OH)(*C)HC(O)CH3 radical adds O2 to form the peroxy radical which reacts with NO to yield the molecular weight 191 hydroxynitrate CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(ONO2)C(O)CH3 or the hydroxyalkoxy radical CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 plus NO2. Our observation of a molecular weight 102 species indicates that the CH3C(O)CH(OH)CH(*O)C(O)CH3 radical dominantly decomposes to CH3C(O)CH(OH)CHO plus CH3(*C)O, rather than decomposing to CH3C(O)CHO plus CH3C(O)(*C)HOH, isomerizing, or reacting with O2.

Although this reaction is typically assumed to form hydroperoxides as the major products (R1a), acetyl peroxy radicals and acetonyl peroxy radicals have been shown to undergo other reactions (R1b) and (R1c) with substantial branching ratios: RO(2) + HO(2) → ROOH + O(2) (R1a), RO(2) + HO(2) → ROH + O(3) (R1b), RO(2) + HO(2) → RO + OH + O(2) (R1c). Theoretical work suggests that reactions (R1b) and (R1c) may be a general feature of acyl peroxy and α-carbonyl peroxy radicals. In this work, branching ratios for R1a-R1c were derived for six carbonyl-containing peroxy radicals: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), and CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO. Branching ratios for reactions of Cl-atoms with butanal, butanone, methacrolein, and methyl vinyl ketone were also measured as a part of this work. Product yields were determined using a combination of long path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The following branching ratios were determined: C(2)H(5)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.35 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0.25 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.4 ± 0.1; C(3)H(7)C(O)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.24 ± 0.15, Y(R1b) = 0.29 ± 0.1, and Y(R1c) = 0.47 ± 0.15; CH(3)C(O)CH(2)O(2), Y(R1a) = 0.75 ± 0.13, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.25 ± 0.13; CH(3)C(O)CH(O(2))CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.42 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.58 ± 0.1; CH(2)ClC(CH(3))(O(2))CHO, Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.2, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2; and CH(2)ClCH(O(2))C(O)CH(3), Y(R1a) = 0.2 ± 0.1, Y(R1b) = 0, and Y(R1c) = 0.8 ± 0.2.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons. The crystal structures of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), p-ClC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) and p-BrC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) were determined by X-ray crystallography using single crystals. The coordination around the phosphorus center in these compounds is best described as distorted tetrahedral and the P(O) and C(O) groups are anti with respect to each other. In the compound Br-C(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) (with two independent molecules in the unit cell), two conformers are connected to each other via two different N-H...O hydrogen bonds forming a non-centrosymmetric dimer. In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

DFT calculations were used to determine the nature of the bonding for the Ti=NNCPh2 moiety in 8 and in the previously reported [Cp2Ti(NNCPh2)(PMe3)]. Reaction of 8 with CO2 gave dimeric [(Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{μ-OC(NNCPh2)O})2] and the \"double-insertion\" dicarboxylate species [Cp*Ti-{MeC(NiPr)2}{OC(O)N(NCPh2)C(O)O}] through an initial [2+2] cycloaddition product [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{N(NCPh2)C(O)O}], the congener of which could be isolated in the corresponding reaction with CS2. The reaction with isocyanates or isothiocyanates tBuNCO or ArNCE (Ar = Tol or 2,6-C6 H3 iPr2 ; E = O, S) gave either complete NNCPh2 transfer, [2+2] cycloaddition to Ti=Nα or single- or double-substrate insertion into the Ti=Nα bond. The treatment of 8 with isonitriles RNC (R = tBu or Xyl) formed σ-adducts [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(NNCPh2)(CNR)]. With Ar(F5)CCH (Ar(F5)=C6F5) the [2+2] cycloaddition product [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{N(NCPh2)C(Ar(F5))C(H)}] was formed, whereas with benzonitriles ArCN (Ar = Ph or Ar(F5)) two equivalents of substrate were coupled in a head-to-tail manner across the Ti=Nα bond to form [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{N(NCPh2)C(Ar)NC(Ar)N}]. Treatment of 8 with RSiH3 (R = aryl or Bu) or Ph2SiH2 gave [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}{N(SiHRR')N(CHPh2)}] (R' = H or Ph) through net 1,3-addition of Si-H to the N-N=CPh2 linkage of 8, whereas reaction with PhSiH2X (X = Cl, Br) led to the Ti=Nα 1,2-addition products [Cp*Ti{MeC(NiPr)2}(X){N(NCPh2)SiH2Ph}].",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Surface tension, electrical conductivity, and isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) were used to study their surface properties, aggregation behaviors, and intermolecular interactions. The mixtures of C12C3C12(SO3)2/C(n)C4(OH)2C(n) (n = 12, 8) and C12C3C12(SO3)2/C12C4C12 show anomalous larger critical micelle concentration (CMC) than C12C3C12(SO3)2, while the mixtures of C12C3C12(SO3)2/C(n)C4(OH)2C(n) (n = 6, 4), C12C3C12(SO3)2/C(n)C4(OH)2C(n) (n = 6, 4), and C12C3C12(SO3)2/C(n)TAB (n = 12, 8, 6) exhibit much lower CMC than C12C3C12(SO3)2. The results indicate that strong hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl chains assisted by strong electrostatic attractions between the headgroups and hydrogen bonds between the spacers lead to the formation of less surface active premicellar aggregates in bulk solution, resulting in the increase of CMC. If these interactions are weakened or inhibited, less surface active premicellar aggregates are no longer formed in the mixtures, and thus the CMC values are reduced. The work reveals that the combination of two surfactants with great self-assembling ability separately may have strong intermolecular binding interactions; however, their mixtures do not always generate superior synergism properties. Only moderate intermolecular interaction can generate the strongest synergism in CMC reduction.",

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

Dioxygen, protons and electrons were sequentially added to the heme along the proposed reaction path for the O(2) reduction mechanism. The electronic structures of [FeOO], [FeOO](-), [FeOOH](+), [FeOOH], [Fe=O, H(2)O](+), [Fe=O](+) and [Fe=O] were thoroughly investigated by using the unrestricted hybrid exchange-correlation functional B3LYP method. The additions of two protons and an electron to [FeOO] lead to the OO bond cleavage to produce a H(2)O molecule with the electron transfer from Fe(II) in heme to the OO moiety. It is shown that the intrinsic OO bond cleavage occurs by adding two protons and two electrons into the OO bond, indicating consistency with a H(2)O formation catalyzed by both MV and FR CcO. The study of the electronic structures of heme-dioxygen complexes gave the different proposals for the mechanisms of a H(2)O formation by both MV and FR CcO.

YOYO bis-intercalates strongly in all the oligonucleotides used and binds preferentially to a (5'-CTAG-3')2 binding site in the oligonucleotide d(CGCTAGCG)2 (1). YOYO also binds preferentially to a (5'-CCGG-3')2 sequence in the oligonucleotide d(CGCCGGCG)2 (2) but slightly less favorably than to the (5'- CTAG-3')2 sequence in 1. The binding of YOYO to the d(CGCTAGCCGGCG):d(CGCCGGCTAGCG) (3) oligonucleotide, containing two preferential binding sites, was also examined. YOYO forms mixtures of 1:1 and 1:2 complexes with oligonucleotide 3 in ratios dependent on the relative amount of YOYO and the oligonucleotides in the sample.

We have also used two dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of the DNA oligonucleotide d(5'-CGCTAGCG-3')2 complexed with YOYO. The determination of the structure was based on a total relaxation matrix analysis of the NOESY cross peaks intensities. DQF-COSY spectra were used to obtain coupling constants for the deoxyribose ring protons. The coupling constants were transformed into angle estimates. The NOE derived distance and dihedral restraints were applied in restrained molecular dynamics calculations. Twenty final structures each were generated for the YOYO-complex from both A-form and B-form dsDNA starting structures giving a total of 40 final structures. Since many NOE contacts were observed between YOYO and dsDNA the resulting structure has a fairly high resolution and allows determination of local features in the dsDNA structure after YOYO binding. The root-mean-square (rms) deviation of the coordinates for the forty structures of the complex was 0.39 A. The local DNA structure is distorted in the complex. The helix is unwound by 106 degrees and has an overall helical repeat of 13 base pairs caused by the bis-intercalation of YOYO. The polypropylene amine linker chain is located in the minor groove of dsDNA. Even though the YOYO chromophore contains an oxygen atom instead of the larger sulphur atom in the corresponding compound, TOTO, the structures establish that YOYO require more space than TOTO in the intercalation sites.

The UV-vis spectra of 7-24 revealed standard absorption spectra for the Ln cations. Representative compounds were used to generate nanoparticles from an established 1,4-butanediol-based solution precipitation route. The nanoproducts isolated adopted either a mixed zincite/lanthanum oxide (18n or 22n) or pure zincite (8n or 10n) phase dependent on NO(3) or OBc moiety. Fluorescence was not observed for any of these nanomaterials possibly due to phase separation, low crystallinity, surface traps, and/or quenching based on elevated Ln cation content.",

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons. The crystal structures of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), p-ClC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(NCH(3)(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) and p-BrC(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) were determined by X-ray crystallography using single crystals. The coordination around the phosphorus center in these compounds is best described as distorted tetrahedral and the P(O) and C(O) groups are anti with respect to each other. In the compound Br-C(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) (with two independent molecules in the unit cell), two conformers are connected to each other via two different N-H...O hydrogen bonds forming a non-centrosymmetric dimer. In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

The reactants approach through an attractive potential surface leading to an intermediate, H3CN, whose formation does not involve any barrier. In agreement with the experimental results, the dominant channel for this reaction is H2CN+H. The theoretically estimated rate coefficient for the overall process at 298 K is 9.1 x 10(-12) cm3 s(-1) molecule(-1), which is nearly 1 order of magnitude lower than the experimental result, but also much larger than those computed for the reactions of ground-state nitrogen atoms with halomethyl radicals. The analysis of the singlet potential energy surface, and the corresponding computational kinetic study, shows that for the reaction of excited nitrogen atoms with methyl radicals, the preferred product from the kinetic point of view is also H2CN+H, but in this case production of HCN is significant (with branching ratios around 0.185). According to our calculations, spin-forbidden processes are highly unlikely for the N(4S) + CH3 reaction.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

The results indicate that strong hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl chains assisted by strong electrostatic attractions between the headgroups and hydrogen bonds between the spacers lead to the formation of less surface active premicellar aggregates in bulk solution, resulting in the increase of CMC. If these interactions are weakened or inhibited, less surface active premicellar aggregates are no longer formed in the mixtures, and thus the CMC values are reduced. The work reveals that the combination of two surfactants with great self-assembling ability separately may have strong intermolecular binding interactions; however, their mixtures do not always generate superior synergism properties. Only moderate intermolecular interaction can generate the strongest synergism in CMC reduction.",

The potential energy surface (PES) of the reaction was calculated by ab initio methods at several levels of coupled-cluster theory.

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

Arrangement A consisted of a laser-flash photolysis set up combined with quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and allowed the determination of the stable products at 4 mbar. The c-C5H9 radicals were produced via the reaction c-C5H10 + Cl with chlorine atoms from the photolysis of CFCl3; the O atoms were generated by photolysis of SO2. Arrangement B, a conventional discharge flow-reactor with molecular beam sampling, was used to determine the rate coefficient. Here, the hydrocarbon radicals (c-C5H9, C2H5, CH2OCH3) were produced via the reaction of atomic fluorine with c-C5H10, C2H6, and CH3OCH3, respectively, and detected by mass spectrometry after laser photoionization. For the c-C5H9 + O reaction, the relative contributions of intermediate formation (c-C5H9O) and direct abstraction (c-C5H8 + OH) were found to be 68 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 4%, respectively.

The three crystal structures are related through an isomorphic and a klassengleiche symmetry transition, respectively. The solid undergoes congruent melting at 320 K. The enthalpy of fusion was determined to be 25.7 kJ mol(-1). The melting process is irreversible and the ionic liquid can be supercooled to its glass transition at 221 K. ",

Mg(2+) bound to OCN to the same extent as Ca(2+) but did not induce the dimerization of OCN. La(3+) bound to a lesser extent than either Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) to OCN and, like Mg(2+), did not influence dimerization. Each Gla residue of OCN participates in Ca(2+) binding, whereas Mg(2+) binding may occur preferentially at sites other than Gla residues.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2. The assignment of quadruple bonding in C2 is misleading, because the bond is weaker than the triple bond in HC≡CH.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes.

The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates.

In all cases, the methane complexes are found to be short-lived and significantly more reactive than the analogous n-heptane complexes. Re(Cp)(CO)2(CH4) and Re(Cp*)(CO)2(L) [Cp* = eta5-C5(CH3)(5) and L = CH4, C2H6] were found to be in rapid equilibrium with the alkyl hydride complexes. In the presence of CO, both alkane and alkyl hydride complexes decay at the same rate. We have used picosecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to directly monitor the photolysis of Re(Cp*)(CO)3 in scCH4 and demonstrated that the initially generated Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH4) forms an equilibrium mixture of Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH4)/Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH3)H within the first few nanoseconds (tau = 2 ns). The ratio of alkane to alkyl hydride complexes varies in the order Re(Cp)(CO)2(C2H6):Re(Cp)(CO)2(C2H5)H &gt; Re(Cp*)(CO)2(C2H6):Re(Cp*)(CO)2(C2H5)H approximately equal to Re(Cp)(CO)2(CH4):Re(Cp)(CO)2(CH3)H &gt; Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH4):Re(Cp*)(CO)2(CH3)H. Activation parameters for the reactions of the organometallic methane and ethane complexes with CO have been measured, and the DeltaH++ values represent lower limits for the CH4 binding enthalpies to the metal center of W-CH4 (30 kJ.mol(-1)), Mn-CH4 (39 kJ.mol(-1)), and Re-CH4 (51 kJ.mol(-1)) bonds in W(CO)5(CH4), Mn(Cp)(CO)2(CH4), and Re(Cp)(CO)2(CH4), respectively.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO. The rate constants for C-addition/elimination channel of the reaction of O((3)P) with CF(3)CN have been determined by using RRKM statistical rate theory and compared with the experimental data. On the singlet surface, the atomic oxygen can easily insert into the C-F or C-C bond of CF(3)CN, forming the insertion intermediates FOCF(2)CN and CF(3)OCN, and O((1)D) can add to the carbon or nitrogen atom of the CN group in CF(3)CN, forming the addition intermediates CF(3)C(O)N and CF(3)CNO; both approaches are found to be barrierless.

The measurements have been accomplished by calibrating against the literature value of the rate coefficient for O(3P) with CS2 (4 x 10(-12) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1)). A product channel giving OCSe in 32.0 +/- 4.2% yield has been found for the O + CSe2 reaction. Although CO was also detected, its generation could be attributed to subsequent reactions of OCSe with O atoms. The corresponding reaction for O + SCSe gives OCS and OCSe as observable products, with their yields given as 32.2 +/- 4.5 and 30.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively.

In the compound Br-C(6)H(4)C(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) (with two independent molecules in the unit cell), two conformers are connected to each other via two different N-H...O hydrogen bonds forming a non-centrosymmetric dimer. In the crystalline lattice of other compounds, the molecules form centrosymmetric dimers via pairs of same N-H...O hydrogen bonds. The structure of CCl(2)HC(O)NHP(O)(N(CH(2)C(6)H(5))(2))(2) reveals an unusual intramolecular interaction between the oxygen of C=O group and amine nitrogen.",

Complex 6.PhCN.H(2)O crystallizes in orthorhombic space group Pbca with (at -154 degrees C) a = 22.603(4) Å, b = 34.759(6) Å, c = 18.167(3) Å, and Z = 8. The complexes contain [Co(4)O(2)(OH)(2)](6+) (5) and [Co(4)O(3)(OH)](5+) (6) distorted-cubane cores, the sites of protonation being apparent by (i) the approach of ClO(4)(-) or [Ce(NO(3))(6)](3)(-) anions to within hydrogen-bonding distances (O.O approximately 2.7 Å) and (ii) the longer Co-OH(-) bond lengths compared with Co-O(2)(-) bond lengths. Peripheral ligation is provided by chelating bpy and syn,syn-bridging RCO(2)(-) groups. The Co(III) atoms are six-coordinate and approximately octahedral. Solution studies show that the diprotonated species is a strong diprotic acid analogous to H(2)SO(4); the first deprotonation goes to completion, but the monoprotonated species is a weak acid and is in equilibirium with the nonprotonated species. pH studies in aqueous solution yield a pK(a2) value of 3.15 for the second deprotonation. Electronic and (1)H NMR spectra of the diprotonated complexes in various solvents are consistent with the monoprotonated complex being the major species in solution. The combined results demonstrate that the [Co(4)O(4)](4+) core is capable of acting as a Brønsted base, undergoing either one or two protonation reactions.",

On the triplet surface, six kinds of pathway are revealed, namely: direct fluorine abstraction, C-addition/elimination, N-addition/elimination, substitution, insertion and F-migration. The results show that the reaction should occur mainly through the C-addition/elimination mechanism involving the chemically activated CF(3)C(O)N* intermediate, and the major products are CF(3) and NCO.

The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

Optimum geometries and frequencies have been computed at BHandHLYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level of theory for all stationary points. Energy values have been improved by single-point calculations at the above geometries using CCSD(T)/6-311++G(2d,2p). The initial attack of OH to HCN was found to lead only to the formation of the HC(OH)N adduct, while for CH(3)CN similar proportions of CH(2)CN and CH(3)C(OH)N are expected. A four-step mechanism has been proposed to explain the OH regeneration, experimentally observed for OH + CH(3)CN reaction, when carried out in the presence of O2. The mechanism steps are as follows: (1) OH addition to the C atom in the CN group, (2) O2 addition to the N atom, (3) an intramolecular H migration from OH to OO, and (4) OH elimination. This mechanism is in line with the one independently proposed by Wine et al. for HCN. The results obtained here suggest that for the OH + HCN reaction, the OH regeneration might occur even in larger extension than for OH + CH(3)CN reaction. The agreement between the calculated data and the available experimental evidence on the studied reactions seems to validate the mechanism proposed here.",

Two different experimental arrangements have been used. Arrangement A consisted of a laser-flash photolysis set up combined with quantitative Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and allowed the determination of the stable products at 4 mbar. The c-C5H9 radicals were produced via the reaction c-C5H10 + Cl with chlorine atoms from the photolysis of CFCl3; the O atoms were generated by photolysis of SO2. Arrangement B, a conventional discharge flow-reactor with molecular beam sampling, was used to determine the rate coefficient. Here, the hydrocarbon radicals (c-C5H9, C2H5, CH2OCH3) were produced via the reaction of atomic fluorine with c-C5H10, C2H6, and CH3OCH3, respectively, and detected by mass spectrometry after laser photoionization. For the c-C5H9 + O reaction, the relative contributions of intermediate formation (c-C5H9O) and direct abstraction (c-C5H8 + OH) were found to be 68 +/- 5 and 32 +/- 4%, respectively. The decomposition products of the chemically activated intermediate could be identified, and the following relative branching fractions were obtained: c-C5H8O + H (31 +/- 2%), CH2CH(CH2)2CHO + H (40 +/- 5%), 2 C2H4 + H + CO (17 +/- 5%), and C3H4O + C2H4 + H (12 +/- 5%). Additionally, the product formation of the c-C5H8 + O reaction was studied, and the following relative yields were obtained (mol %): C2H4, 24%; C3H4O, 18%; c-C5H8O, 30%; c-C5H8O, 23%; 4-pentenal, 5%. The rate coefficient of the c-C5H9 + O reaction was determined relative to the reactions C2H5 + O and CH3OCH2 + O leading to k = (1.73 +/- 0.05) x 10(14) cm3 mol(-1) s(-1).

Unlike the comparable ring expansion of the (1)A(2) state of phenylnitrene (1b) to 1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraene (3b), ring expansion of 1c to 3c is computed to be quite endothermic. Nevertheless, cyclization of 1c, to form the bicyclic intermediate 2c in the ring expansion reaction, is computed to be only slightly more endothermic than the comparable cyclization reaction of 1b to 2b. The origins of these differences between the ring expansion reactions of 1b and 1c have been elucidated through the calculation of the energies of relevant isodesmic reactions.",

Various possible reaction pathways are probed. It is shown that the reaction is initiated by the addition of C(3P) to the C=C bond of C3H6 to generate barrierlessly the three-membered ring isomer 1 CH3-cCHCCH2, followed by the ring-opening process to form 2a trans-CH3CHCCH2, which can easily interconvert to 2b cis-CH3CHCCH2. Starting from 2 (2a, 2b), the most feasible pathway is the internal C-H bond rupture of 2a leading to P4(2CH3CCCH2 + 2H), terminal C-H bond cleavage of 2 (2a,2b) to form P5(2CH3CHCCH + 2H), or direct C-C bond fission of 2b to form P7(2CH2CCH + 2CH3), all of which may have comparable contributions to the title reaction. Much less competitively, 2a takes a 1,2-H-shift to form 5a trans-cis-CH3CHCHCH, followed by a C-C bond rupture leading to P6(1C2H2 + 3CH3CH). Because the intermediates and transition states involved in the feasible pathways all lie below the reactant, the title reaction is expected to be rapid, which is consistent with the measured large rate constant. The present article may provide some useful information for future experimental investigation of the title reaction.",

In all cases, the rate law is of the form, Rate ={k+k(2)(R)[CN(-)]}[S(2)MoS(2)Cu(SC(6)H(4)R-4)(2-)]. It is proposed that both k and k correspond to associative substitution mechanisms. The k pathway involves attack by CN(-) at the copper site followed by dissociation of the thiolate. The k pathway involves attack of the solvent (MeCN) at the copper site, followed by dissociation of the thiolate to form [S(2)MoS(2)Cu(NCMe)](-). Subsequent rapid substitution of the coordinated solvent by cyanide produces [S(2)MoS(2)CuCN](2-). The evidence that both the k and k pathways involve associative mechanisms are: (i) the 4-R-substituent on the thiolate ligand has a similar effect on both k and k, with electron-withdrawing 4-R-substituents facilitating substitution; (ii) both the k and k pathways are associated with similar activation parameters (for k(1)(H): DeltaH++ = 5.5 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = -23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1); for k(2)(H): DeltaH++ = 2.3 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS++ = - 23.9 +/- 2.0 cal deg(-1) mol(-1)) and (iii) addition of C(6)H(5)S(-) results in a similar increase in both k and k.",

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

The X-ray crystal structure of (Me(2)NH(2))(6)[Mo(3)(SnCl(3))S(4)(NCS)(9)].0.5H(2)O has been determined and gives Mo-Mo (mean 2.730 Å) and Mo-Sn (mean 3.732 Å) distances, with a difference close to 1 Å. The red-purple double cube cation [Mo(6)SnS(8)(H(2)O)(18)](8+) is obtained by reacting Sn metal with [Mo(3)S(4)(H(2)O)(9)](4+).

Pure CF3OC(O)OOCF3 and CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 are isolated after thermal decomposition of CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 and repeated trap-to-trap condensation. Additional spectroscopic data of known CF3OC(O)OOCF3 are obtained by recording NMR, IR, Raman, and UV spectra: At room temperature CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 is stable for days in the liquid or gaseous state. The melting point is -38 degrees C, and the boiling point is extrapolated to 73 degrees C from the vapor pressure curve log p = 8.657-1958/T (p/mbar, T/K). The new compound is characterized by molecular mass determination and by NMR, vibrational, and UV spectroscopy. The new trioxide CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 cannot be separated from CF3-OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3 by distillation due to their similar boiling points. CF3OC(O)OOOC(O)OCF3 decomposes at room temperature within hours into a mixture of CF3OC(O)OOC(O)OCF3, CF3OC(O)OOCF3, CO2, and O2.

The bond dissociation energies of the C-C bonds of C2 and HC≡CH were computed using explicitly correlated CASPT2-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 wave functions. The bond dissociation energies and the force constants suggest that C2 has a weaker C-C bond than acetylene. The analysis of the CASSCF wavefunctions in conjunction with the effective bond orders of the multiple bonds shows that there are four bonding components in C2, while there are only three in acetylene and in N2. The bonding components in C2 consist of two weakly bonding σ bonds and two electron-sharing π bonds. The bonding situation in C2 can be described with the σ bonds in Be2 that are enforced by two π bonds. There is no single Lewis structure that adequately depicts the bonding situation in C2.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

Some of the PhCCCO radicals formed in this reaction are sufficiently energised to effect decomposition to give PhCC and CO.",

OSN provides an efficient route for exchanging solutes from the process solvent into the desired mobile phase for CCC, generating a CCC feed containing less than 0.01% (area % by GC) of the original process solvents. The high solvent burden of CCC was additionally reduced through recovery of mobile phase using OSN, with the recovered solvent containing less than 1% (area % by HPLC) impurities. The recovered solvent was then successfully recycled into a subsequent CCC run with no indication of impurity build-up. Coupling OSN with CCC improved the mass-intensity of the CCC process, reducing the solvent use by 56%.

The reaction progress profiles of arylzinc reagents exhibit zero-order kinetic behavior, and a reductive elimination step is confirmed as the rate-determining step. This allows direct measurement of the Csp(2)-Csp(2) reductive elimination rate constant within a catalytic cycle. The rate constants of p-MePhZnCl are obtained in the range 0.23 to 3.5 s(-1) from 0 to -35 degrees C, which are unusually fast reaction rates. According to the Arrhenius equation, the values of DeltaH(double dagger) and DeltaS(double dagger) (DeltaH(double dagger) = 9.7 kcal mol(-1), DeltaS(double dagger) = 35 J mol(-1) K(-1)) are obtained.

These compounds with the general formula R(1)C(O)NHP(O)(N(R(2))(CH(2)C(6)H(5)))(2), where R(1)=CCl(2)H, p-ClC(6)H(4), p-BrC(6)H(4), o-FC(6)H(4) and R(2)=hydrogen, methyl, benzyl, were characterized by several spectroscopic methods and analytical techniques. The effects of phosphorus substituents on the rotation rate around the P-N(amine) bond were also investigated. (1)H NMR study of the synthesized compounds demonstrated that the presence of bulky groups attached to the phosphorus center and electron withdrawing groups in the amide moiety lead to large chemical-shift non-equivalence (Deltadelta(H)) of diastereotopic methylene protons.

The C-C(pi) contribution to (NICS(0,pi) (i.e., at the center of the ring) in oxocarbon dianions decreases with ring size but shows little ring size effect at points 1.0 A above the ring. On the basis of the same criteria, C(4)O(4) exhibits cyclic electron delocalization due to partial occupancy of the sigma CC bonds. However, the dissociation energies of all the neutral oxocarbons, C(n)()O(n)(), are highly exothermic.",

The calculations show that the dicarbon molecule in the ground singlet electronic state can add to methylacetylene without a barrier producing a three-member or a four-member ring intermediate, which can rapidly rearrange to the most stable H(3)CCCCCH isomer on the C(5)H(4) singlet surface. This isomer can then lose a hydrogen atom (H) or molecular hydrogen (H(2)) from the CH(3) group with the formation of H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCCCH, respectively. Alternatively, H atom migrations and three-member-ring closure/opening rearrangements followed by H and H(2) losses can lead to other isomers of the C(5)H(3) and C(5)H(2) species. According to the calculated energetics, the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH reaction is likely to be a major source of the C(5)H(3) radicals (in particular, the most stable H(2)CCCCCH and HCCCHCCH isomers, which are relevant to the formation of benzene through the reactions with CH(3)). Among heavy-fragment product channels, only C(3)H(3) + C(2)H and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) might compete with C(5)H(3) + H and C(5)H(2) + H(2). RRKM calculations of reaction rate constants and product branching ratios depending on the reactive collision energy showed that the major reaction products are expected to be H(2)CCCCCH + H (64-66%) and HCCCHCCH + H (34-30%), with minor contributions from HCCCCCH + H(2) (1-2%), HCCCHCC + H(2) (up to 1%), C(3)H(3) + C(2)H (up to 1%), and c-C(3)H(2) + C(2)H(2) (up to 0.1%) if the energy randomization is complete. The calculations also indicate that the C(2)(X(1)Sigma(g)(+)) + CH(3)CCH(X(1)A(1)) reaction can proceed by direct H-abstraction of a methyl hydrogen to form C(3)H(3) + C(2)H almost without a barrier.",

The cyclopropyl-substituted alkynylcarbene complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CC(3)H(5) (11) dimerizes at 120 degrees C to give a 5:1 ratio of enediyne complexes [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)C(C(3)H(5))C=C(C(3)H(5))C(triple bond)CTol] (12-E and 12-Z); no ring expansion product was observed. This suggests that if intermediate A formed by a [1,1.5] Re shift and having carbene character at the remote alkynyl carbon is involved, then interaction of the neighboring Re with the carbene center greatly diminishes the carbene character as compared with that of free cyclopropyl carbenes. The tethered bis-(alkynylcarbene) complex Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)CCH(2)CH(2)CH(2)C(triple bond)CC(Tol)= Re(CO)(2)Cp (13) dimerizes rapidly at 12 degrees C to give the cyclic cis-enediyne complex [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)[eta(2),eta(2)-TolC(triple bond)CC(CH(2)CH(2)CH(2))=CC(triple bond)CTol] (15). Attempted synthesis of the 1,8-disubstituted naphthalene derivative 1,8-[Cp(CO)(2)Re=C(Tol)C(triple bond)C](2)C(10)H(6) (16), in which the alkynylcarbene units are constrained to a parallel geometry, leads to dimerization to [Cp(CO)(2)Re](2)(eta(2),eta(2)-1,2-(tolylethynyl)acenaphthylene] (17). The very rapid dimerizations of both 13 and 16 provide compelling evidence against mechanisms involving cyclopropene intermediates. A mechanism is proposed which involves rate-determining addition of the carbene center of A to the remote alkynyl carbon of a second alkynylcarbene complex to generate vinyl carbene intermediate C, and rearrangement of C to the enediyne complex by a [1,1.5] Re shift.",

The measurements have been accomplished by calibrating against the literature value of the rate coefficient for O(3P) with CS2 (4 x 10(-12) cm3 molecule(-1) s(-1)). A product channel giving OCSe in 32.0 +/- 4.2% yield has been found for the O + CSe2 reaction. Although CO was also detected, its generation could be attributed to subsequent reactions of OCSe with O atoms. The corresponding reaction for O + SCSe gives OCS and OCSe as observable products, with their yields given as 32.2 +/- 4.5 and 30.2 +/- 3.3%, respectively. Computational studies using UB3LYP/aug-cc-PVTZ methods have been used particularly to determine the reaction pathways for the channels in which OCS or OCSe is produced.",

Reaction rate constants and product ion branching ratios were measured. All of the carbanions react through a common pathway to produce their major products. O(2)(a) adds across a bond at the site of the negative charge, resulting in the cleavage of this bond and the O=O bond. Oxyanions react through a hydride transfer to produce their major products. Proton transfer within these product ion-dipole complexes can occur, where the final branching ratios reflect the basicity of the resulting anions. Several of these anions (CF(3)(-), HC(2)(-), CH(3)OC(O)CH(2)(-)) were also found to undergo several sequential reactions within a single encounter. These three basic types of mechanisms are supported by calculations; a potential energy diagram for each type of reaction has been calculated.
